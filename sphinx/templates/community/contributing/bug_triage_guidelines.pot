msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/community/contributing/bug_triage_guidelines.rst:50
msgid "*Confirmed*: has been confirmed by at least one other contributor than the bug reporter (typically for *Bug* reports). The purpose of this label is to let developers know which issues are still reproducible when they want to select what to work on. It is therefore a good practice to add in a comment on what platform and what version or commit of Godot the issue could be reproduced; if a developer looks at the issue one year later, the *Confirmed* label may not be relevant anymore."
