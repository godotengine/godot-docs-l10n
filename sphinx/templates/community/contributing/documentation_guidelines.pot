Also, have a look at README of the `godot-docs GitHub repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs>`_ and the `docs front page <https://docs.godotengine.org>`_ on what steps to follow and how to contact the docs team."

msgid "Creating or modifying documentation pages is mainly done via the `godot-docs GitHub repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs>`_. The HTML (or PDF and EPUB) documentation is generated from the .rst files (reStructuredText markup language) in that repository. Modifying those pages in a pull request and getting it merged will trigger a rebuild of the online documentation."

These files are then later used to generate the in-editor documentation as well as the API reference of the online docs. Read more here: :ref:`doc_updating_the_class_reference`."
