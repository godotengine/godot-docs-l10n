msgid "The Godot Asset Library, otherwise known as the AssetLib, is a repository of user-submitted Godot addons, scripts, tools, and other resources, collectively referred to as assets. They're available to all Godot users for download directly from within the engine, but it can also be accessed at Godot's `official website <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_."

#: ../../docs/community/asset_library/what_is_assetlib.rst:11
msgid "On the surface, the Asset Library might look and function similar to asset stores available for other engines, such as Unity's Asset Store, or Unreal Engine's Marketplace, where you can submit both freely-available assets, as well as paid, commercial ones. In addition, often times such assets are distributed under non-free, proprietary licenses, limiting what you can do with them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/community/asset_library/what_is_assetlib.rst:17
msgid "The Asset Library is different - all assets are distributed free of charge, and under a host of open-source licenses (such as the MIT license, the GPL, and the Boost Software License). This makes the AssetLib more similar to the software repositories of a Linux distribution."

#: ../../docs/community/asset_library/what_is_assetlib.rst:21
msgid "This set of pages will cover how to use the AssetLib (both from inside Godot, and on the website), how you can submit your own assets, and what the guidelines for submission are."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/community/asset_library/what_is_assetlib.rst:24
msgid "Please note that the AssetLib is relatively young - it may have various pain points, bugs, and usability issues. As with all Godot projects, the code repository is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-asset-library>`_, where you can submit pull requests and issues, so please do not hesitate to visit it!"
