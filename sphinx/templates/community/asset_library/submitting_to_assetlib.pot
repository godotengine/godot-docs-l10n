This file allows giving extra instructions to Git, such as specifying line endings and listing files not required for your asset to function with the ``export-ignore`` directive. This directive removes such files from the resulting ZIP file, preventing them from being downloaded by the asset library users. These are common examples of **.gitattributes**:"
