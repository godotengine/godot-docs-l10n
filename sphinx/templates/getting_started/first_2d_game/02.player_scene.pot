msgid "The first scene will define the ``Player`` object. One of the benefits of creating a separate Player scene is that we can test it separately, even before we've created other parts of the game."

msgid "To begin, we need to choose a root node for the player object. As a general rule, a scene's root node should reflect the object's desired functionality - what the object *is*. Click the \"Other Node\" button and add an :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` node to the scene."

msgid "Godot will display a warning icon next to the node in the scene tree. You can ignore it for now. We will address it later."

msgid "With ``Area2D`` we can detect objects that overlap or run into the player. Change the node's name to ``Player`` by double-clicking on it. Now that we've set the scene's root node, we can add additional nodes to give it more functionality."

msgid "Before we add any children to the ``Player`` node, we want to make sure we don't accidentally move or resize them by clicking on them. Select the node and click the icon to the right of the lock. Its tooltip says \"Make selected node's children not selectable.\""

The ``AnimatedSprite2D`` will handle the appearance and animations for our player. Notice that there is a warning symbol next to the node. An ``AnimatedSprite2D`` requires a :ref:`SpriteFrames <class_SpriteFrames>` resource, which is a list of the animations it can display. To create one, find the ``Sprite Frames`` property under the ``Animation`` tab in the Inspector and click \"[empty]\" -> \"New SpriteFrames\". Click again to open the \"SpriteFrames\" panel:"

msgid "On the left is a list of animations. Click the \"default\" one and rename it to \"walk\". Then click the \"Add Animation\" button to create a second animation named \"up\". Find the player images in the \"FileSystem\" tab - they're in the ``art`` folder you unzipped earlier. Drag the two images for each animation, named ``playerGrey_up[1/2]`` and ``playerGrey_walk[1/2]``, into the \"Animation Frames\" side of the panel for the corresponding animation:"

msgid "The player images are a bit too large for the game window, so we need to scale them down. Click on the ``AnimatedSprite2D`` node and set the ``Scale`` property to ``(0.5, 0.5)``. You can find it in the Inspector under the ``Node2D`` heading."

msgid "Finally, add a :ref:`CollisionShape2D <class_CollisionShape2D>` as a child of ``Player``. This will determine the player's \"hitbox\", or the bounds of its collision area. For this character, a ``CapsuleShape2D`` node gives the best fit, so next to \"Shape\" in the Inspector, click \"[empty]\" -> \"New CapsuleShape2D\". Using the two size handles, resize the shape to cover the sprite:"
