msgid "We want to detect being hit by an enemy differently from squashing them. We want the player to die when they're moving on the floor, but not if they're in the air. We could use vector math to distinguish the two kinds of collisions. Instead, though, we will use an *Area* node, which works well for hitboxes."

msgid "Here is a trick you can use to make the collisions only happen when the player is on the ground or close to it. You can reduce the cylinder's height and move it up to the top of the character. This way, when the player jumps, the shape will be too high up for the enemies to collide with it."

The complementary *Monitoring* property allows it to detect collisions. Then, remove the *Collision -> Layer* and sets the mask to the \"enemies\" layer."
