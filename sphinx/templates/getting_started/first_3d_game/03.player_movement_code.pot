msgstr ""

msgid "These are common properties for a moving body. The ``velocity`` is a 3D vector combining a speed with a direction. Here, we define it as a property because we want to update and reuse its value across frames."
msgstr ""

msgid "The values are quite different from 2D code because distances are in meters. While in 2D, a thousand units (pixels) may only correspond to half of your screen's width, in 3D, it's a kilometer."

msgid "Here, we're going to make all calculations using the ``_physics_process()`` virtual function. Like ``_process()``, it allows you to update the node every frame, but it's designed specifically for physics-related code like moving a kinematic or rigid body."

msgid "We start by initializing a ``direction`` variable to ``Vector3.ZERO``. Then, we check if the player is pressing one or more of the ``move_*`` inputs and update the vector's ``x`` and ``z`` components accordingly. These correspond to the ground plane's axes."

msgid "In case the player presses, say, both W and D simultaneously, the vector will have a length of about ``1.4``. But if they press a single key, it will have a length of ``1``. We want the vector's length to be consistent. To do so, we can call its ``normalize()`` method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/first_3d_game/03.player_movement_code.rst:153
msgid "Here, we only normalize the vector if the direction has a length greater than zero, which means the player is pressing a direction key."

msgid "In this case, we also get the *Pivot* node and call its ``look_at()`` method. This method takes a position in space to look at in global coordinates and the up direction. In this case, we can use the ``Vector3.UP`` constant."
msgstr ""

msgid "A node's local coordinates, like ``translation``, are relative to their parent. Global coordinates are relative to the world's main axes you can see in the viewport instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "In 3D, the property that contains a node's position is ``translation``. By adding the ``direction`` to it, we get a position to look at that's one meter away from the *Player*."

msgid "Then, we update the velocity. We have to calculate the ground velocity and the fall speed separately. Be sure to go back one tab so the lines are inside the ``_physics_process()`` function but outside the condition we just wrote."
msgstr ""

msgid "For the vertical velocity, we subtract the fall acceleration multiplied by the delta time every frame. Notice the use of the ``-=`` operator, which is a shorthand for ``variable = variable - ...``."

msgid "This line of code will cause our character to fall in every frame. This may seem strange if it's already on the floor. But we have to do this for the character to collide with the ground every frame."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/first_3d_game/03.player_movement_code.rst:213
msgid "The physics engine can only detect interactions with walls, the floor, or other bodies during a given frame if movement and collisions happen. We will use this property later to code the jump."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/first_3d_game/03.player_movement_code.rst:217
msgid "On the last line, we call ``KinematicBody.move_and_slide()``. It's a powerful method of the ``KinematicBody`` class that allows you to move a character smoothly. If it hits a wall midway through a motion, the engine will try to smooth it out for you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/first_3d_game/03.player_movement_code.rst:222
msgid "The function takes two parameters: our velocity and the up direction. It moves the character and returns a leftover velocity after applying collisions. When hitting the floor or a wall, the function will reduce or reset the speed in that direction from you. In our case, storing the function's returned value prevents the character from accumulating vertical momentum, which could otherwise get so big the character would move through the ground slab after a while."
