msgid "In this lesson, we will look at signals. They are messages that nodes emit when something specific happens to them, like a button being pressed. Other nodes can connect to that signal and call a function when the event occurs."

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:18
msgid "It is a delegation mechanism built into Godot that allows one game object to react to a change in another without them referencing one another. Using signals limits `coupling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)>`_ and keeps your code flexible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:24
msgid "For example, you might have a life bar on the screen that represents the player’s health. When the player takes damage or uses a healing potion, you want the bar to reflect the change. To do so, in Godot, you would use signals."

msgid "Here, we want to connect the Button's \"pressed\" signal to our Sprite, and we want to call a new function that will toggle its motion on and off. We need to have a script attached to the Sprite node, which we do from the previous lesson."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:104
msgid "There, you can connect the signal to the Sprite node. The node needs a receiver method, a function that Godot will call when the Button emits the signal. The editor generates one for you. By convention, we name these callback methods \"_on_NodeName_signal_name\". Here, it'll be \"_on_Button_pressed\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:111
msgid "When connecting signals via the editor's Node dock, you can use two modes. The simple one only allows you to connect to nodes that have a script attached to them and creates a new callback function on them."

msgid "Our Sprite moves thanks to code in the ``_process()`` function. Godot provides a method to toggle processing on and off: :ref:`Node.set_process() <class_Node_method_set_process>`. Another method of the Node class, ``is_processing()``, returns ``true`` if idle processing is active. We can use the ``not`` keyword to invert the value."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:217
msgid "To get a reference to a node relative to the current one, we use the method :ref:`Node.get_node() <class_Node_method_get_node>`. We can store the reference in a variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:231
msgid "The function ``get_node()`` looks at the Sprite's children and gets nodes by their name. For example, if you renamed the Timer node to \"BlinkingTimer\" in the editor, you would have to change the call to ``get_node(\"BlinkingTimer\")``."

msgid "The line reads like so: we connect the Timer's \"timeout\" signal to the node to which the script is attached (``self``). When the Timer emits \"timeout\", we want to call the function \"_on_Timer_timeout\", that we need to define. Let's add it at the bottom of our script and use it to toggle our sprite's visibility."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:257
msgid "The ``visible`` property is a boolean that controls the visibility of our node. The line ``visible = not visible`` toggles the value. If ``visible`` is ``true``, it becomes ``false``, and vice-versa."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:308
msgid "The signal arguments show up in the editor's node dock, and Godot can use them to generate callback functions for you. However, you can still emit any number of arguments when you emit signals. So it's up to you to emit the correct values."

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:331
msgid "Signals have many uses. With them, you can react to a node entering or exiting the game world, to a collision, to a character entering or leaving an area, to an element of the interface changing size, and much more."
