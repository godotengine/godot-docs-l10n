msgid "In this lesson, we will look at signals. They are messages that nodes emit when something specific happens to them, like a button being pressed. Other nodes can connect to that signal and call a function when the event occurs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:18
msgid "Signals are a delegation mechanism built into Godot that allows one game object to react to a change in another without them referencing one another. Using signals limits `coupling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)>`_ and keeps your code flexible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:24
msgid "For example, you might have a life bar on the screen that represents the playerâ€™s health. When the player takes damage or uses a healing potion, you want the bar to reflect the change. To do so, in Godot, you would use signals."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:94
msgid "Here, we want to connect the Button's \"pressed\" signal to our Sprite, and we want to call a new function that will toggle its motion on and off. We need to have a script attached to the Sprite node, which we do from the previous lesson."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:111
msgid "There, you can connect the signal to the Sprite node. The node needs a receiver method, a function that Godot will call when the Button emits the signal. The editor generates one for you. By convention, we name these callback methods \"_on_NodeName_signal_name\". Here, it'll be \"_on_Button_pressed\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:118
msgid "When connecting signals via the editor's Node dock, you can use two modes. The simple one only allows you to connect to nodes that have a script attached to them and creates a new callback function on them."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:143
msgid "Our Sprite moves thanks to code in the ``_process()`` function. Godot provides a method to toggle processing on and off: :ref:`Node.set_process() <class_Node_method_set_process>`. Another method of the Node class, ``is_processing()``, returns ``true`` if idle processing is active. We can use the ``not`` keyword to invert the value."

msgid "Let's use a different node here. Godot has a :ref:`Timer <class_Timer>` node that's useful to implement skill cooldown times, weapon reloading, and more."

msgid "Call the Timer's ``connect()`` method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:224
msgid "To connect to a signal via code, you need to call the ``connect()`` method of the node you want to listen to. In this case, we want to listen to the Timer's \"timeout\" signal."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:228
msgid "We want to connect the signal when the scene is instantiated, and we can do that using the :ref:`Node._ready() <class_Node_method__ready>` built-in function, which is called automatically by the engine when a node is fully instantiated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:232
msgid "To get a reference to a node relative to the current one, we use the method :ref:`Node.get_node() <class_Node_method_get_node>`. We can store the reference in a variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:242
msgid "The function ``get_node()`` looks at the Sprite's children and gets nodes by their name. For example, if you renamed the Timer node to \"BlinkingTimer\" in the editor, you would have to change the call to ``get_node(\"BlinkingTimer\")``."
msgstr ""

msgid "We can now connect the Timer to the Sprite in the ``_ready()`` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:257
msgid "The line reads like so: we connect the Timer's \"timeout\" signal to the node to which the script is attached (``self``). When the Timer emits \"timeout\", we want to call the function \"_on_Timer_timeout\", that we need to define. Let's add it at the bottom of our script and use it to toggle our sprite's visibility."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:268
msgid "The ``visible`` property is a boolean that controls the visibility of our node. The line ``visible = not visible`` toggles the value. If ``visible`` is ``true``, it becomes ``false``, and vice-versa."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:314
msgid "You can define custom signals in a script. Say, for example, that you want to show a game over screen when the player's health reaches zero. To do so, you could define a signal named \"died\" or \"health_depleted\" when their health reaches 0."

msgid "To emit a signal in your scripts, call ``emit_signal()``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:358
msgid "The signal arguments show up in the editor's node dock, and Godot can use them to generate callback functions for you. However, you can still emit any number of arguments when you emit signals. So it's up to you to emit the correct values."

msgid "Signals have many uses. With them, you can react to a node entering or exiting the game world, to a collision, to a character entering or leaving an area, to an element of the interface changing size, and much more."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:385
msgid "For example, an :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` representing a coin emits a ``body_entered`` signal whenever the player's physics body enters its collision shape, allowing you to know when the player collected it."
