msgid "In :ref:`doc_key_concepts_overview`, we saw that a Godot game is a tree of scenes and that each scene is a tree of nodes. In this lesson, we explain a bit more about them. You will also create your first scene."

msgid "**Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of your game**. They are like the ingredients in a recipe. There are dozens of kinds that can display an image, play a sound, represent a camera, and much more."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/nodes_and_scenes.rst:29
msgid "The last attribute is key. **Together, nodes form a tree**, which is a powerful feature to organize projects. Since different nodes have different functions, combining them produces more complex behavior. As we saw before, you can build a playable character the camera follows using a kinematic body node named \"Character\", a sprite node, a camera node, and a collision shape node."

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/nodes_and_scenes.rst:40
msgid "When you organize nodes in a tree, like our character, we call this construct a scene. Once saved, scenes work like new node types in the editor, where you can add them as a child of an existing node. In that case, the instance of the scene appears as a single node with its internals hidden."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/nodes_and_scenes.rst:45
msgid "Scenes allow you to structure your game's code however you want. You can **compose nodes** to create custom and complex node types, like a game character that runs and jumps, a life bar, a chest with which you can interact, and more."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/nodes_and_scenes.rst:51
msgid "The Godot editor essentially is a **scene editor**. It has plenty of tools for editing 2D and 3D scenes, as well as user interfaces. A Godot project can contain as many of these scenes as you need. The engine only requires one as your application's **main scene**. This is the scene Godot will first load when you or a player runs the game."

msgid "In an empty scene, the Scene dock on the left shows several options to add a root node quickly. \"2D Scene\" adds a Node2D node, \"3D Scene\" adds a Spatial node, and \"User Interface\" adds a Control node. These presets are here for convenience; they are not mandatory. \"Other Node\" lets you select any node to be the root node. In an empty scene, \"Other Node\" is equivalent to pressing the \"Add Child Node\" button at the top-left of the Scene dock, which usually adds a new node as a child of the currently selected node."
