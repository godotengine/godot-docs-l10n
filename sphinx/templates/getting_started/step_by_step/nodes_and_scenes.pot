msgid "In :ref:`doc_key_concepts_overview`, we saw that a Godot game is a tree of scenes and that each scene is a tree of nodes. In this lesson, we explain a bit more about them. You will also create your first scene."

msgid "**Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of your game**. They are like the ingredients in a recipe. There are dozens of kinds that can display an image, play a sound, represent a camera, and much more."

msgid "You can add them to another node as a child."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/nodes_and_scenes.rst:29
msgid "The last attribute is key. **Together, nodes form a tree**, which is a powerful feature to organize projects. Since different nodes have different functions, combining them produces more complex behavior. As we saw before, you can build a playable character the camera follows using a kinematic body node named \"Character\", a sprite node, a camera node, and a collision shape node."

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/nodes_and_scenes.rst:40
msgid "When you organize nodes in a tree, like our character, we call this construct a scene. Once saved, scenes work like new node types in the editor, where you can add them as a child of an existing node. In that case, the instance of the scene appears as a single node with its internals hidden."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/nodes_and_scenes.rst:45
msgid "Scenes allow you to structure your game's code however you want. You can **compose nodes** to create custom and complex node types, like a game character that runs and jumps, a life bar, a chest with which you can interact, and more."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/nodes_and_scenes.rst:51
msgid "The Godot editor essentially is a **scene editor**. It has plenty of tools for editing 2D and 3D scenes, as well as user interfaces. A Godot project can contain as many of these scenes as you need. The engine only requires one as your application's **main scene**. This is the scene Godot will first load when you or a player runs the game."

msgid "In an empty scene, the Scene dock on the left shows several options to add a root node quickly. \"2D Scene\" adds a Node2D node, \"3D Scene\" adds a Spatial node, \"User Interface\" adds a Control node, and \"Other Node\" lets you select any node. It is equivalent to pressing the \"Add Child Node\" button. These presets are here for convenience; they are not mandatory."
