msgid "This lesson will give you an overview of the available scripting languages in Godot. You will learn the pros and cons of each option. In the next part, you will write your first script using GDScript."

msgid "For example, take a game where a Camera2D node follows a ship. The Camera2D node follows its parent by default. Imagine you want it to shake when the player takes damage. As this feature is not built-into Godot, you would attach a script to it and code the camera shake."

msgid "Godot offers **five gameplay programming languages**: GDScript, C#, VisualScript, and C++ and C via its GDNative technology. There are more :ref:`community-supported languages <doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, but these are the official ones."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_languages.rst:31
msgid "You can use multiple languages in a single project. For instance, in a team, you could code gameplay logic in GDScript as it's fast to write, let level designers script quests in the graphical language VisualScript, and use C# or C++ to implement complex algorithms and maximize their performance. Or you can write everything in GDScript or C#. It's your call."

msgid "If you're a beginner, we recommend to **start with GDScript**. We made this language specifically for Godot and the needs of game developers. It has a lightweight and straightforward syntax and provides the tightest integration with Godot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_languages.rst:50
msgid "For C#, you will need an external code editor like `VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ or Visual Studio. While C# support is now mature, you will also find fewer learning resources for it compared to GDScript. That's why we recommend C# mainly to users who already have experience with the language."
