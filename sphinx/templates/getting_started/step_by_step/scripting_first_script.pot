msgid "To move our icon, we need to update its position and rotation every frame in the game loop. We can use the ``_process()`` virtual function of the ``Node`` class. If you define it in any class that extends the Node class, like Sprite, Godot will call the function every frame and pass it an argument named ``delta``, the time elapsed since the last frame."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_first_script.rst:214
msgid "Games work by rendering many images per second, each called a frame, and they do so in a loop. We measure the rate at which a game produces images in Frames Per Second (FPS). Most games aim for 60 FPS, although you might find figures like 30 FPS on slower mobile devices or 90 to 240 for virtual reality games."

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_first_script.rst:220
msgid "The engine and game developers do their best to update the game world and render images at a constant time interval, but there are always small variations in frame render times. That's why the engine provides us with this delta time value, making our motion independent of our framerate."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_first_script.rst:245
msgid "Notice how ``_process()``, like ``_init()``, starts with a leading underscore. By convention, Godot's virtual functions, that is to say, built-in functions you can override to communicate with the engine, start with an underscore."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_first_script.rst:283
msgid "As we already saw, the ``var`` keyword defines a new variable. If you put it at the top of the script, it defines a property of the class. Inside a function, it defines a local variable: it only exists within the function's scope."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_first_script.rst:287
msgid "We define a local variable named ``velocity``, a 2D vector representing both a direction and a speed. To make the node move forward, we start from the Vector2 class's constant Vector2.UP, a vector pointing up, and rotate it by calling the ``Vector2.rotated()`` method. This expression, ``Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation)``, is a vector pointing forward relative to our icon. Multiplied by our ``speed`` property, it gives us a velocity we can use to move the node forward."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_first_script.rst:294
msgid "We add ``velocity * delta`` to the node's ``position`` to move it. The position itself is of type :ref:`Vector2 <class_Vector2>`, a built-in type in Godot representing a 2D vector."
