msgid "Now that you've gotten your feet wet, let's talk about Godot's design."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy.rst:8
msgid "**Every game engine is different and fits different needs.** Not only do they offer a range of features, but the design of each engine is unique. This leads to different workflows and different ways to form your games' structures. This all stems from their respective design philosophies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy.rst:13
msgid "This page is here to help you understand how Godot works, starting with some of its core pillars. It is not a list of available features, nor is it an engine comparison. To know if any engine can be a good fit for your project, you need to try it out for yourself and understand its design and limitations."

msgid "Please watch `Godot explained in 5 minutes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjX5llYZ5eQ>`_ if you're looking for an overview of the engine's features."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy.rst:26
msgid "Godot embraces object-oriented design at its core with its flexible scene system and Node hierarchy. It tries to stay away from strict programming patterns to offer an intuitive way to structure your game."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy.rst:30
msgid "For one, Godot lets you **compose or aggregate** scenes. It's like nested prefabs: you can create a BlinkingLight scene and a BrokenLantern scene that uses the BlinkingLight. Then, create a city filled with BrokenLanterns. Change the BlinkingLight's color, save, and all the BrokenLanterns in the city will update instantly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy.rst:37
msgid "On top of that, you can **inherit** from any scene."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy.rst:39
msgid "A Godot scene could be a Weapon, a Character, an Item, a Door, a Level, part of a level… anything you'd like. It works like a class in pure code, except you're free to design it by using the editor, using only the code, or mixing and matching the two."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy.rst:44
msgid "It's different from prefabs you find in several 3D engines, as you can then inherit from and extend those scenes. You may create a Magician that extends your Character. Modify the Character in the editor and the Magician will update as well. It helps you build your projects so that their structure matches the game's design."

msgid "Also note that Godot offers many different types of objects called nodes, each with a specific purpose. Nodes are part of a tree and always inherit from their parents up to the Node class. Although the engine does feature some nodes like collision shapes that a parent physics body will use, most nodes work independently from one another."

msgid "The goal is to offer a full package to create games and a continuous user experience. You can still work with external programs as long as there is an import plugin for it. Or you can create one, like the `Tiled Map Importer <https://github.com/vnen/godot-tiled-importer>`__."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy.rst:82
msgid "That is also partly why Godot offers its own programming languages GDScript and VisualScript, along with C#. They're designed for the needs of game developers and game designers, and they're tightly integrated in the engine and the editor."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy.rst:87
msgid "GDScript lets you write code using an indentation-based syntax, yet it detects types and offers a static language's quality of auto-completion. It is also optimized for gameplay code with built-in types like Vectors and Colors."

msgid "Note that the 3D workspace doesn't feature as many tools as the 2D workspace. You'll need external programs or add-ons to edit terrains, animate complex characters, and so on.

msgstr ""

msgid "On the other hand, an open codebase means you can **learn from and extend the engine** to your heart's content. You can also debug games easily, as Godot will print errors with a stack trace, even if they come from the engine itself."

msgid "That said, although a handful of core developers work on it full-time, the project has over 600 contributors at the time of writing.
