This Godot tool must either run on a tools-enabled build of the engine or have access to one (distributed alongside or perhaps in the original game's files). The tool can then use the Godot executable to export a PCK file from the command line with :ref:`OS.execute() <class_OS_method_execute>`. The game itself shouldn't use a tool-build of the engine (for security), so it's best to keep the modding tool and game separate."

However, it is also a way of creating patches for one's own game. A PCK file of this kind can fix the content of a previously loaded PCK."
