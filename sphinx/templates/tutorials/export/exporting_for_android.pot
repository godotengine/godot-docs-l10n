To create a smaller APK, uncheck either **Armeabi-v 7a** or **Arm 64 -v 8a** in your project's Android export preset. This will create an APK that only contains a library for a single architecture. Note that applications targeting ARMv7 can also run on ARMv8 devices, but the opposite is not true."

msgid "Since August 2019, Google Play requires all applications to be available in 64-bit form. This means you cannot upload an APK that contains *just* an ARMv7 library. To solve this, you can upload several APKs to Google Play using its `Multiple APK support <https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks>`__. Each APK should target a single architecture; creating an APK for ARMv7 and ARMv8 is usually sufficient to cover most devices in use today."
