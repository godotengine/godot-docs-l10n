msgid "Managing input is usually complex, no matter the OS or platform. To ease this a little, a special built-in type is provided, :ref:`InputEvent <class_InputEvent>`. This datatype can be configured to contain several types of input events. Input events travel through the engine and can be received in multiple locations, depending on the purpose."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/inputevent.rst:34
msgid "However, it is cleaner and more flexible to use the provided :ref:`InputMap <class_InputMap>` feature, which allows you to define input actions and assign them different keys. This way, you can define multiple keys for the same action (e.g. the keyboard escape key and the start button on a gamepad). You can then more easily change this mapping in the project settings without updating your code, and even build a key mapping feature on top of it to allow your game to change the key mapping at runtime!"

msgid "How does it work?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/inputevent.rst:62
msgid "Every input event is originated from the user/player (though it's possible to generate an InputEvent and feed them back to the engine, which is useful for gestures). The OS object for each platform will read events from the device, then feed them to MainLoop. As :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` is the default MainLoop implementation, events are fed to it. Godot provides a function to get the current SceneTree object : **get_tree()**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/inputevent.rst:70
msgid "But SceneTree does not know what to do with the event, so it will give it to the viewports, starting by the \"root\" :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` (the first node of the scene tree). Viewport does quite a lot of stuff with the received input, in order:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/inputevent.rst:77
msgid "First of all, the standard :ref:`Node._input() <class_Node_method__input>` function will be called in any node that overrides it (and hasn't disabled input processing with :ref:`Node.set_process_input() <class_Node_method_set_process_input>`). If any function consumes the event, it can call :ref:`SceneTree.set_input_as_handled() <class_SceneTree_method_set_input_as_handled>`, and the event will not spread any more. This ensures that you can filter all events of interest, even before the GUI. For gameplay input, :ref:`Node._unhandled_input() <class_Node_method__unhandled_input>` is generally a better fit, because it allows the GUI to intercept the events."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/inputevent.rst:82
msgid "Second, it will try to feed the input to the GUI, and see if any control can receive it. If so, the :ref:`Control <class_Control>` will be called via the virtual function :ref:`Control._gui_input() <class_Control_method__gui_input>` and the signal \"gui_input\" will be emitted (this function is re-implementable by script by inheriting from it). If the control wants to \"consume\" the event, it will call :ref:`Control.accept_event() <class_Control_method_accept_event>` and the event will not spread any more. Use the :ref:`Control.mouse_filter <class_Control_property_mouse_filter>` property to control whether a :ref:`Control <class_Control>` is notified of mouse events via :ref:`Control._gui_input() <class_Control_method__gui_input>` callback, and whether these events are propagated further."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/inputevent.rst:92
msgid "If so far no one consumed the event, the unhandled input callback will be called if overridden (and not disabled with :ref:`Node.set_process_unhandled_input() <class_Node_method_set_process_unhandled_input>`). If any function consumes the event, it can call :ref:`SceneTree.set_input_as_handled() <class_SceneTree_method_set_input_as_handled>`, and the event will not spread any more. The unhandled input callback is ideal for full-screen gameplay events, so they are not received when a GUI is active."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/inputevent.rst:97
msgid "If no one wanted the event so far, and a :ref:`Camera <class_Camera>` is assigned to the Viewport with :ref:`Object Picking <class_viewport_property_physics_object_picking>` turned on, a ray to the physics world (in the ray direction from the click) will be cast. (For the root viewport, this can also be enabled in :ref:`Project Settings <class_ProjectSettings_property_physics/common/enable_object_picking>`) If this ray hits an object, it will call the :ref:`CollisionObject._input_event() <class_CollisionObject_method__input_event>` function in the relevant physics object (bodies receive this callback by default, but areas do not. This can be configured through :ref:`Area <class_Area>` properties)."

msgid "Finally, if the event was unhandled, it will be passed to the next Viewport in the tree, otherwise it will be ignored."

msgid "When sending events to all listening nodes within a scene, the viewport will do so in a reverse depth-first order: Starting with the node at the bottom of the scene tree, and ending at the root node:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/inputevent.rst:112
msgid "GUI events also travel up the scene tree but, since these events target specific Controls, only direct ancestors of the targeted Control node receive the event."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/inputevent.rst:115
msgid "In accordance with Godot's node-based design, this enables specialized child nodes to handle and consume particular events, while their ancestors, and ultimately the scene root, can provide more generalized behavior if needed."
