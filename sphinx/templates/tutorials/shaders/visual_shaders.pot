msgid "VisualShaders are the visual alternative for creating shaders."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:8
msgid "As shaders are inherently linked to visuals, the graph-based approach with previews of textures, materials, etc. offers a lot of additional convenience compared to purely script-based shaders. On the other hand, VisualShaders do not expose all features of the shader script and using both in parallel might be necessary for specific effects."

msgid "Creating a VisualShader"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:22
msgid "VisualShaders can be created in any :ref:`class_ShaderMaterial`. To begin using VisualShaders, create a new ``ShaderMaterial`` in an object of your choice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:27
msgid "Then assign a :ref:`class_VisualShader` resource to the ``Shader`` property."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click on the new ``Shader`` resource and the Create Shader dialog will open automatically. Change the Type option to VisualShader in the dropdown."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:43
msgid "The ``Add Node`` button displays a popup menu to let you add nodes to the shader graph."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:45
msgid "The drop-down menu is the shader type: Vertex, Fragment and Light. Like for script shaders, it defines what built-in nodes will be available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:47
msgid "The following buttons and number input control the zooming level, grid snapping and distance between grid lines (in pixels)."

msgid "The last icon shows the generated shader code corresponding to your graph."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:53
msgid "Although VisualShaders do not require coding, they share the same logic with script shaders. It is advised to learn the basics of both to have a good understanding of the shading pipeline."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:57
msgid "The visual shader graph is converted to a script shader behind the scene, and you can see this code by pressing the last button in the toolbar. This can be convenient to understand what a given node does and how to reproduce it in scripts."

msgid "Using the Visual Shader Editor"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:65
msgid "By default, every new ``VisualShader`` will have an output node. Every node connection ends at one of the output node's sockets. A node is the basic unit to create your shader. To add a new node, click on the ``Add Node`` button on the upper left corner or right click on any empty location in the graph, and a menu will pop up."
msgstr ""

msgid "This popup has the following properties:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:75
msgid "If you right-click on the graph, this menu will be called at the cursor position and the created node, in that case, will also be placed under that position; otherwise, it will be created at the graph's center."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:78
msgid "It can be resized horizontally and vertically allowing more content to be shown. Size transform and tree content position are saved between the calls, so if you suddenly closed the popup you can easily restore its previous state."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:81
msgid "The ``Expand All`` and ``Collapse All`` options in the drop-down option menu can be used to easily list the available nodes."

msgid "You can also drag and drop nodes from the popup onto the graph."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:85
msgid "While the popup has nodes sorted in categories, it can seem overwhelming at first. Try to add some of the nodes, plug them in the output socket and observe what happens."

msgid "Expression node"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:104
msgid "The ``Expression`` node allows you to write Godot Shading Language (GLSL-like) expressions inside your visual shaders. The node has buttons to add any amount of required input and output ports and can be resized. You can also set up the name and type of each port. The expression you have entered will apply immediately to the material (once the focus leaves the expression text box). Any parsing or compilation errors will be printed to the Output tab. The outputs are initialized to their zero value by default. The node is located under the Special tab and can be used in all shader modes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:115
msgid "The possibilities of this node are almost limitless – you can write complex procedures, and use all the power of text-based shaders, such as loops, the ``discard`` keyword, extended types, etc. For example:"

msgid "Fresnel node"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:124
msgid "The ``Fresnel`` node is designed to accept normal and view vectors and produces a scalar which is the saturated dot product between them. Additionally, you can setup the inversion and the power of equation. The ``Fresnel`` node is great for adding a rim-like lighting effect to objects."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:134
msgid "The ``Boolean`` node can be converted to ``Scalar`` or ``Vector`` to represent ``0`` or ``1`` and ``(0, 0, 0)`` or ``(1, 1, 1)`` respectively. This property can be used to enable or disable some effect parts with one click."

msgid "If node"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.rst:143
msgid "The ``If`` node allows you to setup a vector which will be returned the result of the comparison between ``a`` and ``b``. There are three vectors which can be returned: ``a == b`` (in that case the tolerance parameter is provided as a comparison threshold – by default it is equal to the minimal value, i.e. ``0.00001``), ``a > b`` and ``a < b``."
