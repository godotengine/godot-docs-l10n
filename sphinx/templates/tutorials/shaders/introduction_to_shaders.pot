msgid "Shaders are a special kind of program that runs on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). They were initially used to shade 3D scenes but can nowadays do much more. You can use them to control how the engine draws geometry and pixels on the screen, allowing you to achieve all sorts of effects."

msgid "Modern rendering engines like Godot draw everything with shaders: graphics cards can run thousands of instructions in parallel, leading to incredible rendering speed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:19
msgid "Because of their parallel nature, though, shaders don't process information the way a typical program does. Shader code runs on each vertex or pixel in isolation. You cannot store data between frames either. As a result, when working with shaders, you need to code and think differently from other programming languages."

msgid "Your code is already part of a loop in a shader, so the corresponding code would look like this."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:48
msgid "Godot provides a shading language based on the popular OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) but simplified. The engine handles some of the lower-level initialization work for you, making it easier to write complex shaders."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:52
msgid "In Godot, shaders are made up of three main functions: ``vertex()``, ``fragment()``, and ``light()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:55
msgid "The ``vertex()`` function runs over all the vertices in the mesh and sets their positions and some other per-vertex variables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:58
msgid "The ``fragment()`` function runs for every pixel covered by the mesh. It uses values output by the ``vertex()`` function, interpolated between the vertices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:62
msgid "The ``light()`` function runs for every pixel and for every light. It takes variables from the ``fragment()`` function and from its previous runs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:67
msgid "The ``light()`` function won't run if the ``vertex_lighting`` render mode is enabled, or if **Rendering > Quality > Shading > Force Vertex Shading** is enabled in the Project Settings. It's enabled by default on mobile platforms."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:75
msgid "Instead of supplying a general-purpose configuration for all uses (2D, 3D, particles), you must specify the type of shader you're writing. Different types support different render modes, built-in variables, and processing functions."

msgid "Render modes alter the way Godot applies the shader. For example, the ``unshaded`` mode makes the engine skip the built-in light processor function."

msgid "Depending on the shader type, you can override different processor functions. For ``spatial`` and ``canvas_item``, you have access to ``vertex()``, ``fragment()``, and ``light()``. For ``particles``, you only have access to ``vertex()``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:123
msgid "Each vertex in your world's geometry has properties like a position and color. The function modifies those values and passes them to the fragment function. You can also use it to send extra data to the fragment function using varyings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:127
msgid "By default, Godot transforms your vertex information for you, which is necessary to project geometry onto the screen. You can use render modes to transform the data yourself; see the :ref:`Spatial shader doc <doc_spatial_shader>` for an example."

msgid "Fragment processor"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:135
msgid "The ``fragment()`` processing function is used to set up the Godot material parameters per pixel. This code runs on every visible pixel the object or primitive draws. It is only available in ``spatial`` and ``canvas_item`` shaders."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:139
msgid "The standard use of the fragment function is to set up material properties used to calculate lighting. For example, you would set values for ``ROUGHNESS``, ``RIM``, or ``TRANSMISSION``, which would tell the light function how the lights respond to that fragment. This makes it possible to control a complex shading pipeline without the user having to write much code. If you don't need this built-in functionality, you can ignore it and write your own light processing function, and Godot will optimize it away. For example, if you do not write a value to ``RIM``, Godot will not calculate rim lighting. During compilation, Godot checks to see if ``RIM`` is used; if not, it cuts all the corresponding code out. Therefore, you will not waste calculations on the effects that you do not use."

msgid "Light processor"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:154
msgid "The ``light()`` processor runs per pixel too, and it runs once for every light that affects the object. It does not run if no lights affect the object. It exists as a function called inside the ``fragment()`` processor and typically operates on the material properties setup inside the ``fragment()`` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/introduction_to_shaders.rst:159
msgid "The ``light()`` processor works differently in 2D than it does in 3D; for a description of how it works in each, see their documentation, :ref:`CanvasItem shaders <doc_canvas_item_shader>` and :ref:`Spatial shaders <doc_spatial_shader>`, respectively."
