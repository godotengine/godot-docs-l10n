msgid "In programming languages, a *preprocessor* allows changing the code before the compiler reads it. Unlike the compiler, the preprocessor does not care about whether the syntax of the preprocessed code is valid. The preprocessor always performs what the *directives* tell it to do. A directive is a statement starting with a hash symbol (``#``). It is not a *keyword* of the shader language (such as ``if`` or ``for``), but a special kind of token within the language."

msgid "From Godot 4.0 onwards, you can use a shader preprocessor within text-based shaders. The syntax is similar to what most GLSL shader compilers support (which in turn is similar to the C/C++ preprocessor)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/shaders/shader_reference/shader_preprocessor.rst:23
msgid "The shader preprocessor is not available in :ref:`visual shaders <doc_visual_shaders>`. If you need to introduce preprocessor statements to a visual shader, you can convert it to a text-based shader using the **Convert to Shader** option in the VisualShader inspector resource dropdown. This conversion is a one-way operation; text shaders cannot be converted back to visual shaders."
