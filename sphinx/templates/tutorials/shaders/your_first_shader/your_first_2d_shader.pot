msgid "In Godot you can override three functions to control how the shader operates; ``vertex``, ``fragment``, and ``light``. This tutorial will walk you through writing a shader with both vertex and fragment functions. Light functions are significantly more complex than vertex and fragment functions and so will not be covered here."
