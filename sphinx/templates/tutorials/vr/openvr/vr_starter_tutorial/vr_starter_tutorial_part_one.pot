If either of the VR controllers are moving the player, then the vignette shader makes itself visible by setting it's ``visible`` property to ``true``. If neither VR controller is moving the player, so ``directional_movement`` is ``false`` in both VR controllers, than the vignette shader makes itself invisible by setting it's ``visible`` property to ``false``."
