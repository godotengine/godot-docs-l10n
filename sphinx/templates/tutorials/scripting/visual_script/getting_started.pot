msgid "As with everything in Godot, we prioritize a good experience over copying or integrating third party solutions which might not fit nicely in the current workflow. This led us to write our own version of how we believe this feature would work best with the engine."

msgid "In Godot, a Visual Script fits smoothly together with regular scripts in the Editor tab"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/visual_script/getting_started.rst:15
msgid "In fact, Visual Scripting integrates so well to Godot that it's hard to believe it was added only in version 3.0. This is because, when editing, the rest of Godot panels and docks act like a palette from where you can drag and drop all sorts of information to the script canvas:"

msgid "Once it opens, the script type \"Visual Script\" must be selected from the drop down list. The script extension must be \".vs\" (for Visual Script!)."

msgid "Adding a function"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/visual_script/getting_started.rst:45
msgid "Unlike other visual scripting implementations, Visual Scripting in Godot is heavily based on functions. This happens because it uses the same interface to communicate with the engine as other scripting engines. In Godot, the scripting interface is universal and all implementations conform to it."

msgid "A function is an individual canvas with nodes connected."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/visual_script/getting_started.rst:58
msgid "Most types of nodes and other types of objects in Godot contain virtual functions. These are functions that will be called (run your code) when something happens and can be looked up in the reference. Virtual functions are listed when pressing the \"Override\" icon in the member panel:"
msgstr ""

msgid "In the following example, a function will be executed when the node is loaded and added to the running scene. For this, the _ready() virtual method will be overridden:"

msgid "Nodes in a tree emit signals when something happens. Godot uses signals for all sorts of things. A typical example would be a button that emits a \"pressed\" signal when actually pressed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/visual_script/getting_started.rst:88
msgid "For this, a node must be selected and the Node tab opened. This will allow inspecting the signals. Once they are displayed, connect the \"pressed\" signal:"

msgid "Creating a function manually"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/visual_script/getting_started.rst:109
msgid "The last way to create functions is to do it manually. In general, this is not as common unless you really need it. Custom functions work when another (or the same) script calls them manually. The main use cases for this are breaking a larger function up into several manageable chunks and reusing your visual code."
