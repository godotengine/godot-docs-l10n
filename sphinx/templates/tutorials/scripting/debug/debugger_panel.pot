msgid "Unlike other debugging tools, the profiler does not start automatically. It can be started at any time during gameplay by pressing the start button. You can even start the profiler before opening the game to profile startup performance. It can also be started and stopped while the game is running without losing information from when it was last running. The information it records won't go away unless you click clear, or close the game, reopen it and start the profiler again."

msgid "After starting and stopping the profiler, you should see things being kept track of on the left and a graph on the right. The items listed on the left are everything that contributes to frame time, and they should each have a value for time and calls for the current frame you are looking at."

All monitors keep track of stats automatically, so even if one monitor isn't open while the game is running, you can open it later and see how the values changed."
