msgid "Godot's scene system, while powerful and flexible, has a drawback: there is no method for storing information (e.g. a player's score or inventory) that is needed by more than one scene."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:13
msgid "It's possible to address this with some workarounds, but they come with their own limitations:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:16
msgid "You can use a \"master\" scene that loads and unloads other scenes as its children. However, this means you can no longer run those scenes individually and expect them to work correctly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:19
msgid "Information can be stored to disk in ``user://`` and then loaded by scenes that require it, but frequently saving and loading data is cumbersome and may be slow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:23
msgid "The `Singleton pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern>`_ is a useful tool for solving the common use case where you need to store persistent information between scenes. In our case, it's possible to reuse the same scene or class for multiple singletons as long as they have different names."

msgid "Godot won't make an AutoLoad a \"true\" singleton as per the singleton design pattern. It may still be instanced more than once by the user if desired."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:57
msgid "When autoloading a script, a :ref:`class_Node` will be created and the script will be attached to it. This node will be added to the root viewport before any other scenes are loaded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:63
msgid "To autoload a scene or script, select **Project > Project Settings** from the menu and switch to the **AutoLoad** tab."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:68
msgid "Here you can add any number of scenes or scripts. Each entry in the list requires a name, which is assigned as the node's ``name`` property. The order of the entries as they are added to the global scene tree can be manipulated using the up/down arrow keys. Like regular scenes, the engine will read these nodes in top-to-bottom order."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the **Enable** column is checked (which is the default), then the singleton can be accessed directly without requiring ``get_node()``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:102
msgid "Note that autoload objects (scripts and/or scenes) are accessed just like any other node in the scene tree. In fact, if you look at the running scene tree, you'll see the autoloaded nodes appear:"

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:110
msgid "Autoloads must **not** be removed using ``free()`` or ``queue_free()`` at runtime, or the engine will crash."

msgid "Custom scene switcher"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:116
msgid "This tutorial will demonstrate building a scene switcher using autoloads. For basic scene switching, you can use the :ref:`SceneTree.change_scene() <class_SceneTree_method_change_scene>` method (see :ref:`doc_scene_tree` for details). However, if you need more complex behavior when changing scenes, this method provides more functionality."

msgid "The project contains two scenes: ``Scene1.tscn`` and ``Scene2.tscn``. Each scene contains a label displaying the scene name and a button with its ``pressed()`` signal connected. When you run the project, it starts in ``Scene1.tscn``. However, pressing the button does nothing."

msgid "Now whenever we run any scene in the project, this script will always be loaded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:147
msgid "Returning to the script, it needs to fetch the current scene in the `_ready()` function. Both the current scene (the one with the button) and ``Global.gd`` are children of root, but autoloaded nodes are always first. This means that the last child of root is always the loaded scene."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:179
msgid "Now we need a function for changing the scene. This function needs to free the current scene and replace it with the requested one."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:248
msgid "Using :ref:`Object.call_deferred() <class_Object_method_call_deferred>`, the second function will only run once all code from the current scene has completed. Thus, the current scene will not be removed while it is still being used (i.e. its code is still running)."

msgid "When scenes are small, the transition is instantaneous. However, if your scenes are more complex, they may take a noticeable amount of time to appear. To learn how to handle this, see the next tutorial: :ref:`doc_background_loading`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.rst:302
msgid "Alternatively, if the loading time is relatively short (less than 3 seconds or so), you can display a \"loading plaque\" by showing some kind of 2D element just before changing the scene. You can then hide it just after the scene is changed. This can be used to indicate to the player that a scene is being loaded."
