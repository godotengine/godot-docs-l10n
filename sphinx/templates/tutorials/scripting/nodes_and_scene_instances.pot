msgid "Getting nodes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:12
msgid "You can get a reference to a node by calling the :ref:`Node.get_node() <class_Node_method_get_node>` method. For this to work, the child node must be present in the scene tree. Getting it in the parent node's ``_ready()`` function guarantees that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:17
msgid "If, for example,  you have a scene tree like this, and you want to get a reference to the Sprite2D and Camera2D nodes to access them in your script."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:22
msgid "To do so, you can use the following code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:47
msgid "Note that you get nodes using their name, not their type. Above, \"Sprite2D\" and \"Camera2D\" are the nodes' names in the scene."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:52
msgid "If you rename the Sprite2D node as Skin in the Scene dock, you have to change the line that gets the node to ``get_node(\"Skin\")`` in the script."

msgid "Node paths"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:60
msgid "When getting a reference to a node, you're not limited to getting a direct child. The ``get_node()`` function supports paths, a bit like when working with a file browser. Add a slash to separate nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Take the following example scene, with the script attached to the UserInterface node."

msgid "To get the AnimationPlayer node, you would use the following code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:90
msgid "As with file paths, you can use \"..\" to get a parent node. The best practice is to avoid doing that though not to break encapsulation. You can also start the path with a forward slash to make it absolute, in which case your topmost node would be \"/root\", the application's predefined root viewport."

msgid "Syntactic sugar"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:99
msgid "You can use two shorthands to shorten your code in GDScript. Firstly, putting the ``@onready`` annotation before a member variable makes it initialize right before the ``_ready()`` callback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:107
msgid "There is also a short notation for ``get_node()``: the dollar sign, \"$\". You place it before the name or path of the node you want to get."

msgid "To create a node from code, call its ``new()`` method like for any other class-based datatype."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:121
msgid "You can store the newly created node's reference in a variable and call ``add_child()`` to add it as a child of the node to which you attached the script."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:146
msgid "To delete a node and free it from memory, you can call its ``queue_free()`` method. Doing so queues the node for deletion at the end of the current frame after it has finished processing. At that point, the engine removes the node from the scene and frees the object in memory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:160
msgid "Before calling ``sprite2d.queue_free()``, the remote scene tree looks like this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:164
msgid "After the engine freed the node, the remote scene tree doesn't display the sprite anymore."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:169
msgid "You can alternatively call ``free()`` to immediately destroy the node. You should do this with care as any reference to it will instantly become ``null``. We recommend using ``queue_free()`` unless you know what you're doing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:173
msgid "When you free a node, it also frees all its children. Thanks to this, to delete an entire branch of the scene tree, you only have to free the topmost parent node."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:197
msgid "Preloading the scene can improve the user's experience as the load operation happens when the compiler reads the script and not at runtime. This feature is only available with GDScript."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:206
msgid "At that point, ``scene`` is a packed scene resource, not a node. To create the actual node, you need to call :ref:`PackedScene.instantiate() <class_PackedScene_method_instantiate>`. It returns a tree of nodes that you can use as a child of your current node."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/nodes_and_scene_instances.rst:222
msgid "The advantage of this two-step process is you can keep a packed scene loaded and create new instances on the fly. For example, to quickly instance several enemies or bullets."
