msgid "To draw a curve between them, we first interpolate gradually over the two vertices of each of the two segments formed by the three points, using values ranging from 0 to 1. This gives us two points that move along the segments as we change the value of ``t`` from 0 to 1."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/beziers_and_curves.rst:205
msgid "Only evaluating them may be an option, but in most cases it's not very useful. The big drawback with Bezier curves is that if you traverse them at constant speed, from ``t = 0`` to ``t = 1``, the actual interpolation will *not* move at constant speed. The speed is also an interpolation between the distances between points ``p0``, ``p1``, ``p2`` and ``p3`` and there is not a mathematically simple way to traverse the curve at constant speed."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/beziers_and_curves.rst:230
msgid "As you can see, the speed (in pixels per second) of the circle varies, even though ``t`` is increased at constant speed. This makes beziers difficult to use for anything practical out of the box."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/beziers_and_curves.rst:235
msgid "Drawing beziers (or objects based on the curve) is a very common use case, but it's also not easy. For pretty much any case, Bezier curves need to be converted to some sort of segments. This is normally difficult, however, without creating a very high amount of them."

msgid "The reason is that some sections of a curve (specifically, corners) may require considerable amounts of points, while other sections may not:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/beziers_and_curves.rst:241
msgid "Additionally, if both control points were ``0, 0`` (remember they are relative vectors), the Bezier curve would just be a straight line (so drawing a high amount of points would be wasteful)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/beziers_and_curves.rst:243
msgid "Before drawing Bezier curves, *tessellation* is required. This is often done with a recursive or divide and conquer function that splits the curve until the curvature amount becomes less than a certain threshold."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/beziers_and_curves.rst:245
msgid "The *Curve* classes provide this via the :ref:`Curve2D.tessellate() <class_Curve2D_method_tessellate>` function (which receives optional ``stages`` of recursion and angle ``tolerance`` arguments). This way, drawing something based on a curve is easier."

msgid "Traversal"

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/beziers_and_curves.rst:253
msgid "To make this easier, the curves need to be *baked* into equidistant points. This way, they can be approximated with regular interpolation (which can be improved further with a cubic option). To do this, just use the :ref:`Curve3D.sample_baked()<class_Curve3D_method_sample_baked>` method together with :ref:`Curve2D.get_baked_length()<class_Curve2D_method_get_baked_length>`. The first call to either of them will bake the curve internally."
