msgid "Interpolation is a very basic operation in graphics programming. It's good to become familiar with it in order to expand your horizons as a graphics developer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/interpolation.rst:8
msgid "The basic idea is that you want to transition from A to B. A value ``t``, represents the states in-between."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/interpolation.rst:10
msgid "For example, if ``t`` is 0, then the state is A. If ``t`` is 1, then the state is B. Anything in-between is an *interpolation*."

msgid "The name of this type of interpolation, which transforms a value into another at *constant speed* is *\"linear\"*. So, when you hear about *Linear Interpolation*, you know they are referring to this formula."

msgid "For cubic interpolation, there are also :ref:`Vector2.cubic_interpolate() <class_Vector2_method_cubic_interpolate>` and :ref:`Vector3.cubic_interpolate() <class_Vector3_method_cubic_interpolate>`, which do a :ref:`Bezier <doc_beziers_and_curves>` style interpolation."

msgid "It is also possible to interpolate whole transforms (make sure they have either uniform scale or, at least, the same non-uniform scale). For this, the function :ref:`Transform3D.interpolate_with() <class_Transform3D_method_interpolate_with>` can be used."
