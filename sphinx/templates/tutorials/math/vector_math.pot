msgid "This tutorial is a short and practical introduction to linear algebra as it applies to game development. Linear algebra is the study of vectors and their uses. Vectors have many applications in both 2D and 3D development and Godot uses them extensively. Developing a good understanding of vector math is essential to becoming a strong game developer."

msgid "Any position in the 2D plane can be identified by a pair of numbers in this way. However, we can also think of the position ``(4, 3)`` as an **offset** from the ``(0, 0)`` point, or **origin**. Draw an arrow pointing from the origin to the point:"

msgid "This is a **vector**. A vector represents a lot of useful information. As well as telling us that the point is at ``(4, 3)``, we can also think of it as an angle ``θ`` (theta) and a length (or magnitude) ``m``. In this case, the arrow is a **position vector** - it denotes a position in space, relative to the origin."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/vector_math.rst:216
msgid "Because normalization involves dividing by the vector's length, you cannot normalize a vector of length ``0``. Attempting to do so would normally result in an error.

msgstr ""

msgid "The green arrows ``fA`` and ``fB`` are **unit vectors** representing the zombie's facing direction and the blue semicircle represents its field of view. For zombie ``A``, we find the direction vector ``AP`` pointing to the player using ``P - A`` and normalize it, however, Godot has a helper method to do this called :ref:`direction_to() <class_Vector2_method_direction_to>`. If the angle between this vector and the facing vector is less than 90°, then the zombie can see the player."

Its magnitude depends on their relative angle. If two vectors are parallel, the result of their cross product will be a null vector."
