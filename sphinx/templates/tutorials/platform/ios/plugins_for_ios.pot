msgid "The parameter will usually be a Dictionary, with the information necessary to make the request, and the call will have two phases. First, the method will immediately return an Error value. If the Error is not 'OK', the call operation is completed, with an error probably caused locally (no internet connection, API incorrectly configured, etc). If the error value is 'OK', a response event will be produced and added to the 'pending events' queue. Example:"

#: ../../docs/tutorials/platform/ios/plugins_for_ios.rst:76
msgid "Remember that when a call returns OK, the API will *always* produce an event through the pending_event interface, even if it's an error, or a network timeout, etc. You should be able to, for example, safely block the interface waiting for a reply from the server.
