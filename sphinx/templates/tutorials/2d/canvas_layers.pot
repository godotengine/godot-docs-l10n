msgid ":ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` is the base for all 2D nodes, be it regular 2D nodes, such as :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>`, or :ref:`Control <class_Control>`. Both inherit from :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>`. You can arrange canvas items in trees. Each item will inherit its parent's transform: when the parent moves, its children move too."

msgid "CanvasItem nodes, and nodes inheriting from them, are direct or indirect children of a :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`, that display them."

msgid "A Viewport has the property :ref:`Viewport.canvas_transform <class_Viewport_property_canvas_transform>`, allows to apply a custom :ref:`Transform2D <class_Transform2D>` transform to the CanvasItem hierarchy it contains. Nodes such as :ref:`Camera2D <class_Camera2D>` work by changing that transform."

msgid "The answer is :ref:`CanvasLayer <class_CanvasLayer>`, which is a node that adds a separate 2D rendering layer for all its children and grand-children. Viewport children will draw by default at layer \"0\", while a CanvasLayer will draw at any numeric layer. Layers with a greater number will be drawn above those with a smaller number. CanvasLayers also have their own transform and do not depend on the transform of other layers. This allows the UI to be fixed in screen-space while our view on the game world changes."

msgid "An example of this is creating a parallax background. This can be done with a CanvasLayer at layer \"-1\". The screen with the points, life counter and pause button can also be created at layer \"1\"."

msgid "CanvasLayers aren't necessary to control the drawing order of nodes. The standard way to ensuring that a node is  correctly drawn 'in front' or 'behind' others is to manipulate the order of the nodes in the scene panel. Perhaps counterintuitively, the topmost nodes in the scene panel are drawn on *behind* lower ones in the viewport. 2d nodes also have a property for controlling their drawing order (see :ref:`Node2D.z_index <class_Node2D_property_z_index>`)."
