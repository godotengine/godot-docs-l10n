msgid "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create 2D animated characters with the AnimatedSprite class and the AnimationPlayer. Typically, when you create or download an animated character, it will come in one of two ways: as individual images or as a single sprite sheet containing all the animation's frames.  Both can be animated in Godot with the AnimatedSprite class."

msgid "First, we'll use :ref:`AnimatedSprite <class_AnimatedSprite>` to animate a collection of individual images. Then we will animate a sprite sheet using this class.  Finally, we will learn another way to animate a sprite sheet with :ref:`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>` and the *Animation* property of :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>`."

Instead, it's applied the next time the :ref:`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>` is processed. This may end up being on the next frame, causing a 'glitch' frame, where the property change was applied but the animation was not. If this turns out to be a problem, after calling ``play()``, you can call ``advance(0)`` to update the animation immediately."

msgid "These examples illustrate the two classes you can use in Godot for 2D animation. ``AnimationPlayer`` is a bit more complex than ``AnimatedSprite``, but it provides additional functionality, since you can also animate other properties like position or scale. The class ``AnimationPlayer`` can also be used with an ``AnimatedSprite``.  Experiment to see what works best for your needs."
