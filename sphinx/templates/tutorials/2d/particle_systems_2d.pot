msgid "The idea is that a \"particle\" is emitted at a fixed interval and with a fixed lifetime. During its lifetime, every particle will have the same base behavior. What makes each particle different from the rest and provides a more organic look is the \"randomness\" associated with each parameter. In essence, creating a particle system means setting base physics parameters and then adding randomness to them."

msgid "Godot provides two different nodes for 2D particles, :ref:`class_Particles2D` and :ref:`class_CPUParticles2D`. Particles2D is more advanced and uses the GPU to process particle effects, but that limits it to higher end graphics API, and in our case to the GLES3 renderer. For projects using the GLES2 backend, CPUParticles2D is a CPU-driven option with near feature parity with Particles2D, but lesser performance. While Particles2D is configured via a :ref:`class_ParticlesMaterial` (and optionally with a custom shader), the matching options are provided via node properties in CPUParticles2D (with the exception of the trail settings). You can convert a Particles2D node into a CPUParticles2D node by clicking on the node in the inspector, and selecting \"Convert to CPUParticles2D\" in the \"Particles\" menu of the toolbar."
