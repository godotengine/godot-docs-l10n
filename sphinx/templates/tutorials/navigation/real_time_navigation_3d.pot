msgstr ""

msgid "The \"map\" is the entire world for navigation, it's similar to \"space\" for the physics engine. It's comprised of navigation regions, these regions define parts of the world that can be navigated around by navigation agents."
msgstr ""

msgid "To create a navigation region add the :ref:`NavigationMeshInstance<class_NavigationMeshInstance>` node to a 3D scene. Next in the inspector for that mesh create or add a :ref:`NavigationMesh<class_NavigationMesh>`. The navmesh contains options for how it will be generated when it's baked. The geometry options control which nodes, and types of nodes, are used to bake the mesh. A full description of each setting and how it works can be found in the :ref:`NavigationMesh class reference<class_NavigationMesh>`."

msgid "Once the mesh has finished generating you should see the transparent navigation mesh above the areas in the scene that can be navigated to."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/real_time_navigation_3d.rst:48
msgid "Keep in mind that the navmesh shows where the center of an entity can go. For example, if you set the agent radius to 0.5 then the navigation mesh will have a distance of 0.5 from any ledges or walls to prevent clipping into the wall or hanging off of the edge."
msgstr ""

msgid "Navigation agents can moved from one region to another if they are next to each other. Additionally a baked navmesh can be moved at runtime and agents will still be able to navigate onto it from another region. For example, navigating onto a moving platform that has stopped will work."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/real_time_navigation_3d.rst:75
msgid "To use it set a target like normal. Then an agent needs to fetch its next nav path location, and compute its velocity to that location. Instead of using that value to move use it to set the velocity on the agent with `set_velocity`. Then a new velocity that takes into account other agents and obstacles is generated and emitted with the signal `velocity_computed`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/real_time_navigation_3d.rst:81
msgid "However agents can only take into account a set number of other nearby agents, this is the :ref:`max neighbors<class_NavigationAgent_property_max_neighbors>` property of an agent and can be adjusted. This is **not** a limit for how many agents can use a navigation region at the same time."

msgid "This node is used to mark physics bodies that move around a navigation area that agents need to avoid (this will only work if you use RVO processing). For example, this node would be useful for pieces of debris in a destructible environment. Add it as the child of a physics body and navigation agent nodes will avoid it while pathfinding."

msgid "To get a path between two areas on a map you use the navigation node method ``get_simple_path()``. The first argument is a Vector3 of the starting location, the next is a Vector3 of the end location.
