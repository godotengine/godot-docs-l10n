msgid "When designing a user interface there may be times when a :ref:`Control <class_Control>` node needs to have a different look than what is normally defined by a :ref:`Theme <class_Theme>`. Every control node has theme property overrides, which allow you to redefine the styling for each individual UI element."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/ui/gui_theme_type_variations.rst:14
msgid "This approach quickly becomes hard to manage, if you need to share the same custom look between several controls. Imagine that you use gray, blue, and red variants of :ref:`Button <class_Button>` throughout your project. Setting it up every time you add a new button element to your interface is a tedious task."

msgid "To help with the organization and to better utilize the :ref:`power of themes <doc_gui_skinning>` you can use theme type variations. These work like normal theme types, but instead of being self-sufficient and standalone they extend another, base type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/ui/gui_theme_type_variations.rst:23
msgid "Following the previous example, your theme can have some styles, colors, and fonts defined for the ``Button`` type, customizing the looks of every button element in your UI. To then have a gray, red, or blue button you would create a new type, e.g. ``GrayButton``, and mark it as a variation of the base ``Button`` type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/ui/gui_theme_type_variations.rst:28
msgid "Type variations can replace some aspects of the base type, but keep others. They can also define properties that the base style hasn't defined. For example, your ``GrayButton`` can override the ``normal`` style from the base ``Button`` and add ``font_color`` that ``Button`` has never defined. The control will use a combination of both types giving priority to the type variation."

msgid "Click on the plus icon next to the **Base Type** field. You can select the base type there, which would typically be the name of a control node class (e.g., ``Button``, ``Label``, etc). Type variations can also chain and extend other type variations. This works in the same way control nodes inherit styling of their base class. For example, ``CheckButton`` inherits styles from ``Button`` because corresponding node types extend each other."

msgid "You can either select a type variations from a dropdown list, or input its name manually. Variations appear on the list only if the type variation belongs to the project-wide theme, which you can configure in the project settings. For any other case you have to input the name of the variation manually. Click on the pencil icon to the right. Then type in the name of the type variation and click the check mark icon or press enter. If a type variation with that name exists it will now be used by the node."
