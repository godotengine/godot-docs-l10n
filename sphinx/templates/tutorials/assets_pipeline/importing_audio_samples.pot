msgid "WAV files use raw data or light compression (IMA-ADPCM). They are lightweight on the CPU to play back (hundreds of simultaneous voices in this format are fine). The downside is that they take up a lot of disk space."

msgid "Ogg Vorbis files use a stronger compression that results in much smaller file size, but require significantly more processing power to play back."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_audio_samples.rst:20
msgid "MP3 files use better compression than WAV with IMA-ADPCM, but worse than Ogg Vorbis. This means that a MP3 file with roughly equal quality to Ogg Vorbis will be significantly larger. On the bright side, MP3 requires less CPU usage to play back compared to Ogg Vorbis. This makes MP3 useful for mobile and HTML5 projects where CPU resources are limited, especially when playing multiple compressed sounds at the same time (such as long ambient sounds)."
