msgid "The world is full of different languages and cultures, so nowadays games are released in several languages. To handle this, internationalized text must be supported in any modern game engine."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_translations.rst:13
msgid "In regular desktop or mobile applications, internationalized text is usually located in resource files (or .po files for GNU stuff). Games, however, can use several orders of magnitude more text than applications, so they must support efficient methods for dealing with loads of multilingual text."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_translations.rst:19
msgid "There are two approaches to generate multilingual language games and applications. Both are based on a key:value system. The first is to use one of the languages as the key (usually English), the second is to use a specific identifier. The first approach is probably easier for development if a game is released first in English, later in other languages, but a complete nightmare if working with many languages at the same time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_translations.rst:27
msgid "In general, games use the second approach and a unique ID is used for each string. This allows you to revise the text while it is being translated to other languages. The unique ID can be a number, a string, or a string with a number (it's just a unique string anyway)."

msgid "To complete the picture and allow efficient support for translations, Godot has a special importer that can read CSV files. Most spreadsheet editors can export to this format, so the only requirement is that the files have a special arrangement. The CSV files **must** be saved with UTF-8 encoding without a `byte order mark <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark>`__."
