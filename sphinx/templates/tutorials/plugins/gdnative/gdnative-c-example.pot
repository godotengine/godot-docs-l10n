Finally, our fourth and fifth parameters are descriptions for our constructor and destructor."

msgid "We then tell Godot about our methods (well our one method in this case), by calling ``nativescript_register_method`` for each method of our class. In our case, that is just ``get_data``. Our first parameter is yet again our handle pointer. The second is again the name of the object class we're registering. The third is the name of our function as it will be known to GDScript. The fourth is our attributes setting (see ``godot_method_rpc_mode`` enum in ``godot_headers/nativescript/godot_nativescript.h`` for possible values). The fifth and final parameter is a description of which function to call when the method gets called."
msgstr ""

msgid "The description struct ``instance_method`` contains the function pointer to the function itself as first field. The other two fields in these structs are for specifying per-method userdata. The second is the ``method_data`` field which is passed on every function call as the ``p_method_data`` argument. This is useful to reuse one function for different methods on possibly multiple different script-classes. If the ``method_data`` value is a pointer to memory that needs to be freed, the third ``free_func`` field can contain a pointer to a function that will free that memory. That free function gets called when the script itself (not instance!) gets unloaded (so usually at library-unload time)."

msgid "And then, we define our constructor. All we do in our constructor is allocate memory for our structure and fill it with some data.

This pointer will act as our instance identifier in case multiple objects are instantiated."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/plugins/gdnative/gdnative-c-example.rst:308
msgid "And finally, we implement our ``get_data`` function. Data is always sent and returned as variants so in order to return our data, which is a string, we first need to convert our C string to a Godot string object, and then copy that string object into the variant we are returning."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/plugins/gdnative/gdnative-c-example.rst:329
msgid "Strings are heap-allocated in Godot, so they have a destructor which frees the memory. Destructors are named ``godot_TYPENAME_destroy``. When a Variant gets created with a String, it references the String. That means that the original String can be \"destroyed\" to decrease the ref-count. If that does not happen the String memory will leak since the ref-count will never be zero and the memory never deallocated. The returned variant gets automatically destroyed by Godot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/plugins/gdnative/gdnative-c-example.rst:338
msgid "In more complex operations it can be confusing the keep track of which value needs to be deallocated and which does not. As a general rule: call ``godot_TYPENAME_destroy`` when a C++ destructor would be called instead. The String destructor would be called in C++ after the Variant was created, so the same is necessary in C."
