msgid "The inspector dock allows you to create custom widgets to edit properties through plugins. This can be beneficial when working with custom datatypes and resources, although you can use the feature to change the inspector widgets for built-in types. You can design custom controls for specific properties, entire objects, and even separate controls associated with particular datatypes."

msgid "This guide explains how to use the :ref:`class_EditorInspectorPlugin` and :ref:`class_EditorProperty` classes to create a custom interface for integers, replacing the default behavior with a button that generates random values between 0 and 99."

msgid "Let's assume you've called your plugin folder ``my_inspector_plugin``. If so, you should end up with a new ``addons/my_inspector_plugin`` folder that contains two files: ``plugin.cfg`` and ``plugin.gd``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/plugins/editor/inspector_plugins.rst:34
msgid "As before, ``plugin.gd`` is a script extending :ref:`class_EditorPlugin` and you need to introduce new code for its ``_enter_tree`` and ``_exit_tree`` methods. To set up your inspector plugin, you must load its script, then create and add the instance by calling ``add_inspector_plugin()``. If the plugin is disabled, you should remove the instance you have added by calling ``remove_inspector_plugin()``."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/plugins/editor/inspector_plugins.rst:41
msgid "Here, you are loading a script and not a packed scene. Therefore you should use ``new()`` instead of ``instance()``."

msgid "To interact with the inspector dock, your ``my_inspector_plugin.gd`` script must extend the :ref:`class_EditorInspectorPlugin` class. This class provides several virtual methods that affect how the inspector handles properties."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/plugins/editor/inspector_plugins.rst:94
msgid "To have any effect at all, the script must implement the ``_can_handle()`` method. This function is called for each edited :ref:`class_Object` and must return ``true`` if this plugin should handle the object or its properties."

msgid "You can implement four other methods to add controls to the inspector at specific positions. The ``parse_begin()`` and ``parse_end()`` methods are called only once at the beginning and the end of parsing for each object, respectively. They can add controls at the top or bottom of the inspector layout by calling ``add_custom_control()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/plugins/editor/inspector_plugins.rst:106
msgid "As the editor parses the object, it calls the ``parse_category()`` and ``_parse_property()`` methods. There, in addition to ``add_custom_control()``, you can call both ``add_property_editor()`` and ``add_property_editor_for_multiple_properties()``. Use these last two methods to specifically add :ref:`class_EditorProperty`-based controls."
