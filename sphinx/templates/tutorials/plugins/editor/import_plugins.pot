msgid "An import plugin is a special type of editor tool that allows custom resources to be imported by Godot and be treated as first-class resources. The editor itself comes bundled with a lot of import plugins to handle the common resources like PNG images, Collada and glTF models, Ogg Vorbis sounds, and many more."

msgid "This tutorial shows how to create an import plugin to load a custom text file as a material resource. This text file will contain three numeric values separated by comma, which represents the three channels of a color, and the resulting color will be used as the albedo (main color) of the imported material. In this example it contains the pure blue color (zero red, zero green, and full blue):"

We store a reference to it in a class member ``import_plugin`` so we can refer to it later when removing it. The :ref:`remove_import_plugin() <class_EditorPlugin_method_remove_import_plugin>` method is called when the plugin is deactivated to clean up the memory and let the editor know the import plugin isn't available anymore."
