msgid "Godot implements Dictionary as an ``OrderedHashMap<Variant, Variant>``. The engine stores a small array (initialized to 2^3 or 8 records) of key-value pairs. When one attempts to access a value, they provide it a key. It then *hashes* the key, i.e. converts it into a number. The \"hash\" is used to calculate the index into the array. As an array, the OHM then has a quick lookup within the \"table\" of keys mapped to values. When the HashMap becomes too full, it increases to the next power of 2 (so, 16 records, then 32, etc.) and rebuilds the structure."

msgid "Godot implements Objects as stupid, but dynamic containers of data content. Objects query data sources when posed questions. For example, to answer the question, \"do you have a property called, 'position'?\", it might ask its :ref:`script <class_Script>` or the :ref:`ClassDB <class_ClassDB>`. One can find more information about what objects are and how they work in the :ref:`doc_what_are_godot_classes` article."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/data_preferences.rst:177
msgid "The important detail here is the complexity of the Object's task. Every time it performs one of these multi-source queries, it runs through *several* iteration loops and HashMap lookups. What's more, the queries are linear-time operations dependent on the Object's inheritance hierarchy size. If the class the Object queries (its current class) doesn't find anything, the request defers to the next base class, all the way up until the original Object class. While these are each fast operations in isolation, the fact that it must make so many checks is what makes them slower than both of the alternatives for looking up data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/data_preferences.rst:189
msgid "When developers mention how slow the scripting API is, it is this chain of queries they refer to. Compared to compiled C++ code where the application knows exactly where to go to find anything, it is inevitable that scripting API operations will take much longer. They must locate the source of any relevant data before they can attempt to access it."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/data_preferences.rst:203
msgid "NativeScript C++ goes even further and keeps everything internal by default. Calls into external structures will go through the scripting API. In NativeScript C++, registering methods to expose them to the scripting API is a manual task. It is at this point that external, non-C++ classes will use the API to locate them."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/data_preferences.rst:212
msgid "**Control:** With objects comes the ability to create more sophisticated structures. One can layer abstractions over the data to ensure the external API doesn't change in response to internal data structure changes. What's more, Objects can have signals, allowing for reactive behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/data_preferences.rst:217
msgid "**Clarity:** Objects are a reliable data source when it comes to the data that scripts and engine classes define for them. Properties may not hold the values one expects, but one doesn't need to worry about whether the property exists in the first place."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/data_preferences.rst:222
msgid "**Convenience:** If one already has a similar data structure in mind, then extending from an existing class makes the task of building the data structure much easier. In comparison, Arrays and Dictionaries don't fulfill all use cases one might have."

msgid "Most languages offer an enumeration type option. GDScript is no different, but unlike most other languages, it allows one to use either integers or strings for the enum values (the latter only when using the ``export`` keyword in GDScript). The question then arises, \"which should one use?\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/data_preferences.rst:293
msgid "On a technical level, integer comparisons (constant-time) will happen faster than string comparisons (linear-time). If one wants to keep up other languages' conventions though, then one should use integers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/data_preferences.rst:297
msgid "The primary issue with using integers comes up when one wants to *print* an enum value. As integers, attempting to print ``MY_ENUM`` will print ``5`` or what-have-you, rather than something like ``\"MyEnum\"``. To print an integer enum, one would have to write a Dictionary that maps the corresponding string value for each enum."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/data_preferences.rst:303
msgid "If the primary purpose of using an enum is for printing values and one wishes to group them together as related concepts, then it makes sense to use them as strings. That way, a separate data structure to execute on the printing is unnecessary."
