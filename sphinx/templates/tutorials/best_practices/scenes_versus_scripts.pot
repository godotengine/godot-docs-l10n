msgid "We've already covered how scenes and scripts are different. Scripts define an engine class extension with imperative code, scenes with declarative code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/scenes_versus_scripts.rst:10
msgid "Each system's capabilities are different as a result. Scenes can define how an extended class initializes, but not what its behavior actually is. Scenes are often used in conjunction with a script so that the scene acts as an extension of the scripts declarative code."

msgid "But, choosing which one to use can be a dilemma. Creating script instances is identical to creating in-engine classes whereas handling scenes requires a change in API:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/scenes_versus_scripts.rst:59
msgid "Also, scripts will operate a little slower than scenes due to the speed differences between engine and script code. The larger and more complex the node, the more reason there is to build it as a scene."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/scenes_versus_scripts.rst:195
msgid "Script code like this is much slower than engine-side C++ code. Each instruction makes a call to the scripting API which leads to many \"lookups\" on the back-end to find the logic to execute."
