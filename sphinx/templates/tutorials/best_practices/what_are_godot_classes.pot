msgid "The engine offers two main ways to create reusable objects: scripts and scenes. Neither of these technically define classes under the hood."

msgid "Still, many best practices using Godot involve applying object-oriented programming principles to the scripts and scenes that compose your game. That is why it's useful to understand how we can think of them as classes."

msgid "The engine provides built-in classes like :ref:`Node <class_Node>`. You can extend those to create derived types using a script."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/what_are_godot_classes.rst:22
msgid "These scripts are not technically classes. Instead, they are resources that tell the engine a sequence of initializations to perform on one of the engine's built-in classes."

msgid "Godot's internal classes have methods that register a class's data with a :ref:`ClassDB <class_ClassDB>`. This database provides runtime access to class information. ``ClassDB`` contains information about classes like:"

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/what_are_godot_classes.rst:43
msgid "Even scripts that don't use the ``extends`` keyword implicitly inherit from the engine's base :ref:`RefCounted <class_RefCounted>` class. As a result, you can instantiate scripts without the ``extends`` keyword from code. Since they extend ``RefCounted`` though, you cannot attach them to a :ref:`Node <class_Node>`."

msgid "Scenes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/what_are_godot_classes.rst:51
msgid "The behavior of scenes has many similarities to classes, so it can make sense to think of a scene as a class. Scenes are reusable, instantiable, and inheritable groups of nodes. Creating a scene is similar to having a script that creates nodes and adds them as children using ``add_child()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/what_are_godot_classes.rst:55
msgid "We often pair a scene with a scripted root node that makes use of the scene's nodes. As such, the script extends the scene by adding behavior through imperative code."

msgid "Why is any of this important to scene organization? Because instances of scenes *are* objects. As a result, many object-oriented principles that apply to written code also apply to scenes: single responsibility, encapsulation, and others."
