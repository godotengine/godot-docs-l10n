#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/collision_shapes_3d.rst:47
msgid ":ref:`Convex collision shapes <class_ConvexPolygonShape>` are a compromise between primitive collision shapes and concave collision shapes. They can represent shapes of any complexity, but with an important caveat. As their name implies, an individual shape can only represent a *convex* shape. For instance, a pyramid is *convex*, but a hollow box is *concave*. To define a concave object with a single collision shape, you need to use a concave collision shape."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/collision_shapes_3d.rst:54
msgid "Depending on the object's complexity, you may get better performance by using multiple convex shapes instead of a concave collision shape. Godot lets you use *convex decomposition* to generate convex shapes that roughly match a hollow object. Note this performance advantage no longer applies after a certain amount of convex shapes. For large and complex objects such as a whole level, we recommend using concave shapes instead."

msgid "**Create Single Convex Collision Sibling** uses the Quickhull algorithm. It creates one CollisionShape node with an automatically generated convex collision shape. Since it only generates a single shape, it provides good performance and is ideal for small objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/collision_shapes_3d.rst:70
msgid "**Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings** uses the V-HACD algorithm. It creates several CollisionShape nodes, each with a convex shape. Since it generates multiple shapes, it is more accurate for concave objects at the cost of performance. For objects with medium complexity, it will likely be faster than using a single concave collision shape."

msgid ":ref:`Concave collision shapes <class_ConcavePolygonShape>`, also called trimesh collision shapes, can take any form, from a few triangles to thousands of triangles. Concave shapes are the slowest option but are also the most accurate in Godot. **You can only use concave shapes within StaticBodies.** They will not work with KinematicBodies or RigidBodies unless the RigidBody's mode is Static."

msgid "Even though concave shapes offer the most accurate *collision*, contact reporting can be less precise than primitive shapes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/collision_shapes_3d.rst:90
msgid "When not using GridMaps for level design, concave shapes are the best approach for a level's collision. That said, if your level has small details, you may want to exclude those from collision for performance and game feel. To do so, you can build a simplified collision mesh in a 3D modeler and have Godot generate a collision shape for it automatically. More on that below"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/collision_shapes_3d.rst:96
msgid "Note that unlike primitive and convex shapes, a concave collision shape doesn't have an actual \"volume\". You can place objects both *outside* of the shape as well as *inside*."

msgid "You aren't limited to a single collision shape per PhysicsBody. Still, we recommend keeping the number of shapes as low as possible to improve performance, especially for dynamic objects like RigidBodies and KinematicBodies. On top of that, avoid translating, rotating, or scaling CollisionShapes to benefit from the physics engine's internal optimizations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/collision_shapes_3d.rst:137
msgid "When using a single non-transformed collision shape in a StaticBody, the engine's *broad phase* algorithm can discard inactive PhysicsBodies. The *narrow phase* will then only have to take into account the active bodies' shapes. If a StaticBody has many collision shapes, the broad phase will fail. The narrow phase, which is slower, must then perform a collision check against each shape."
