msgid "Even with physics interpolation active, there may be some local situations where you would benefit from disabling automatic interpolation for a :ref:`Node<class_Node>` (or branch of the :ref:`SceneTree<class_SceneTree>`), and have the finer control of performing interpolation manually."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/advanced_physics_interpolation.rst:13
msgid "This is possible using the :ref:`Node.physics_interpolation_mode<class_Node_property_physics_interpolation_mode>` property which is present in all Nodes. If you for example, turn off interpolation for a Node, the children will recursively also be affected (as they default to inheriting the parent setting). This means you can easily disable interpolation for an entire subscene."

msgid "The most common situation where you may want to perform your own interpolation is Cameras."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/advanced_physics_interpolation.rst:20
msgid "In many cases, a :ref:`Camera<class_Camera>` can use automatic interpolation just like any other node. However, for best results, especially at low physics tick rates, it is recommended that you take a manual approach to Camera interpolation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/advanced_physics_interpolation.rst:22
msgid "This is because viewers are very sensitive to Camera movement. For instance, a Camera that realigns slightly every 1/10th of a second (at 10tps tick rate) will often be noticeable. You can get a much smoother result by moving the Camera each frame in ``_process``, and following an interpolated target manually."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/advanced_physics_interpolation.rst:29
msgid "The very first step when performing manual Camera interpolation is to make sure the Camera transform is specified in *global space* rather than inheriting the transform of a moving parent. This is because feedback can occur between the movement of a parent node of a Camera and the movement of the Camera Node itself, which can mess up the interpolation."

msgid "Call :ref:`Spatial.set_as_toplevel<class_Spatial_method_set_as_toplevel>` and set this to ``true``, which will make the Camera ignore the transform of its parent."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/advanced_physics_interpolation.rst:44
msgid "But there is a problem. If we use the traditional ``get_global_transform()`` on a Camera \"target\" Node, this transform will only focus the Camera on the target *at the current physics tick*. This is *not* what we want, as the Camera will jump about on each physics tick as the target moves. Even though the Camera may be updated each frame, this does not help give smooth motion if the *target* is only changing each physics tick."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/advanced_physics_interpolation.rst:51
msgid "We can do this using the :ref:`Spatial.get_global_transform_interpolated<class_Spatial_method_get_global_transform_interpolated>` function. This acts exactly like getting :ref:`Spatial.global_transform<class_Spatial_property_global_transform>` but it gives you the *interpolated* transform (during a ``_process()`` call)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/advanced_physics_interpolation.rst:53
msgid "``get_global_transform_interpolated()`` should only be used once or twice for special cases such as Cameras. It should **not** be used all over the place in your code (both for performance reasons, and to give correct gameplay)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/advanced_physics_interpolation.rst:55
msgid "Aside from exceptions like the Camera, in most cases, your game logic should be in ``_physics_process()``. In game logic you should be calling ``get_global_transform()`` or ``get_transform()``, which will give the current physics transform (in global or local space respectively), which is usually what you will want for gameplay code."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/advanced_physics_interpolation.rst:94
msgid "Mouse look is a very common way of controlling Cameras. But there is a problem. Unlike keyboard input which can be sampled periodically on the physics tick, mouse move events can come in continuously. The Camera will be expected to react and follow these mouse movements on the next frame, rather than waiting until the next physics tick."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/advanced_physics_interpolation.rst:96
msgid "In this situation, it can be better to disable physics interpolation for the Camera node (using :ref:`Node.physics_interpolation_mode<class_Node_property_physics_interpolation_mode>`) and directly apply the mouse input to the Camera rotation, rather than apply it in ``_physics_process``."
