msgid "Since version 3.1, Godot supports ragdoll physics. Ragdolls rely on physics simulation to create realistic procedural animation. They are used for death animations in many games."

msgid "Like many other features in the engine, there is a node to set up a ragdoll: the :ref:`PhysicalBone <class_PhysicalBone>` node. To simplify the setup, you can generate ``PhysicalBone`` nodes with the \"Create physical skeleton\" feature in the skeleton node."

msgid "For example, if we take a humanoid, you do not want to have physical bones for each finger. You can use a single bone for the entire hand instead, or one for the palm, one for the thumb, and a last one for the other four fingers."

msgid "Remove these physical bones: ``MASTER``, ``waist``, ``neck``, ``headtracker``. This gives us an optimized skeleton and makes it easier to control the ragdoll."

msgid "Once you adjusted the collision shapes, your ragdoll is almost ready. You just want to adjust the pin joints to get a better simulation. ``PhysicalBone`` nodes have an unconstrained pin joint assigned to them by default. To change the pin joint, select the ``PhysicalBone`` and change the constraint type in the ``Joint`` section. There, you can change the constraint's orientation and its limits."
