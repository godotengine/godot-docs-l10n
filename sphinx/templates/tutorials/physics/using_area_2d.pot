msgid "Godot offers a number of collision objects to provide both collision detection and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your project can be confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if you understand how each of them works and what their pros and cons are. In this tutorial, we'll look at the :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` node and show some examples of how it can be used."

msgid "An Area2D defines a region of 2D space. In this space you can detect other :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` nodes overlapping, entering, and exiting. Areas also allow for overriding local physics properties. We'll explore each of these functions below."

msgid "Note that Area2D extends :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, so it also provides properties inherited from that class. The ``Collision`` section of ``CollisionObject2D`` is where you configure the area's collision layer(s) and mask(s)."

msgid "Overlap detection"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/using_area_2d.rst:50
msgid "Perhaps the most common use of Area2D nodes is for contact and overlap detection. When you need to know that two objects have touched, but don't need physical collision, you can use an area to notify you of the contact."

msgid "For example, let's say we're making a coin for the player to pick up. The coin is not a solid object - the player can't stand on it or push it - we just want it to disappear when the player touches it."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/using_area_2d.rst:62
msgid "To detect the overlap, we'll connect the appropriate signal on the Area2D. Which signal to use depends on the player's node type. If the player is another area, use ``area_entered``. However, let's assume our player is a ``CharacterBody2D`` (and therefore a ``CollisionObject2D`` type), so we'll connect the ``body_entered`` signal."

msgid "The second major use for area nodes is to alter physics. By default, the area won't do this, but you can enable this with the ``Space Override`` property. When areas overlap, they are processed in ``Priority`` order (higher priority areas are processed first). There are four options for override:"
