msgid "There are many ways to procedurally generate geometry in Godot. In this tutorial series we will explore a few of them. Each technique has its own benefits and drawbacks, so it is best to understand each one and how it can be useful in a given situation."

msgid "Geometry is a fancy way of saying shape. In computer graphics, geometry is typically represented by an array of positions called \"vertices\". In Godot, geometry is represented by Meshes."

msgid "Many things in Godot have mesh in their name: the :ref:`Mesh <class_Mesh>`, the :ref:`ArrayMesh <class_ArrayMesh>`, the :ref:`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>`, the :ref:`MultiMesh <class_MultiMesh>`, and the :ref:`MultiMeshInstance <class_MultiMeshInstance>`. While they are all related, they have slightly different uses."
msgstr ""

msgid "Meshes and ArrayMeshes are resources that are drawn using a MeshInstance node. Resources like Meshes and ArrayMeshes cannot be added to the scene directly. A MeshInstance represents one instance of a mesh in your scene. You can reuse a single mesh in multiple MeshInstances to draw it in different parts of your scene with different materials or transformations (scale, rotation, position etc.)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/procedural_geometry/index.rst:38
msgid "If you are going to draw the same object many times, it can be helpful to use a MultiMesh with a MultiMeshInstance. The MultiMeshInstance draws meshes thousands of times very cheaply. It takes advantage of hardware instancing in order to do so. The drawback with using a MultiMeshInstance is that you are limited to one material for all instances. It uses an instance array to store different colors and transformations for each instance, but all the instances use the same material."

msgid "A Mesh is composed of one or more surfaces. A surface is an array composed of multiple sub-arrays containing vertices, normals, UVs, etc. Normally the process of constructing surfaces and meshes is hidden from the user in the :ref:`VisualServer <class_VisualServer>`, but with ArrayMeshes, the user can construct a Mesh manually by passing in an array containing the surface information."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/procedural_geometry/index.rst:62
msgid "The surface array is an array of length ``ArrayMesh.ARRAY_MAX``. Each position in the array is filled with a sub-array containing per-vertex information. For example, the array located at ``ArrayMesh.ARRAY_NORMAL`` is a :ref:`PoolVector3Array <class_PoolVector3Array>` of vertex normals."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/procedural_geometry/index.rst:66
msgid "The surface array can be indexed or non-indexed. Creating a non-indexed array is as easy as not assigning an array at the index ``ArrayMesh.ARRAY_INDEX``. A non-indexed array stores unique vertex information for every triangle, meaning that when two triangles share a vertex, the vertex is duplicated in the array. An indexed surface array only stores vertex information for each unique vertex and then also stores an array of indices which maps out how to construct the triangles from the vertex array. In general, using an indexed array is faster, but it means you have to share vertex data between triangles, which is not always desired (e.g. when you want per-face normals)."

The SurfaceTool generates a Mesh that needs to be added a MeshInstance to be seen."
msgstr ""

msgid "The MeshDataTool is not fast, but it gives you access to all kinds of properties of the mesh that you don't get with the others (edges, faces, etc.). It is incredibly useful when you need that sort of data to transform the mesh, but it is not a good idea to use it if that information is not needed. The MeshDataTool is best used if you are going to be using an algorithm that requires access to the face or edge array."
