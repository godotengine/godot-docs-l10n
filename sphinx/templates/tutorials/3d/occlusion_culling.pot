msgid "Since the engine has less work to do (fewer vertices to render and fewer draw calls), performance will increase as long as there are enough occlusion culling opportunities in the scene. This means occlusion culling is most effective in indoor scenes, preferably with many smaller rooms instead of fewer larger rooms. Combine this with :ref:`doc_mesh_lod` and :ref:`doc_visibility_ranges` to further improve performance gains."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/occlusion_culling.rst:61
msgid "When using the Clustered Forward rendering backend, the engine already performs a *depth prepass*. This consists in rendering a depth-only version of the scene before rendering the scene's actual materials. This is used to ensure each opaque pixel is only shaded once, reducing the cost of overdraw significantly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/occlusion_culling.rst:67
msgid "The greatest performance benefits can be observed when using the Forward Mobile rendering backend, as it does not feature a depth prepass for performance reasons. As a result, occlusion culling will actively decrease shading overdraw with that rendering backend."

msgid "In Godot, occlusion culling works by rasterizing the scene's occluder geometry to a low-resolution buffer on the CPU. This is done using the software raytracing library `Embree <https://github.com/embree/embree>`__."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/occlusion_culling.rst:88
msgid "The engine then uses this low-resolution buffer to test occludees' :abbr:`AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)` against the occluder shapes. The occludee's :abbr:`AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)` must be *fully occluded* by the occluder shape to be culled."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/occlusion_culling.rst:93
