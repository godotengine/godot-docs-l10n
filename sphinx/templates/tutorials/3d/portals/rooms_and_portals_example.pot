#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/portals/rooms_and_portals_example.rst:88
msgid "Try creating a Camera and adding it to the scene. If you run the scene you will notice that the portal culling is not active. This is because the ``room graph`` must be created each time you load a level, by converting the rooms. Instead of using a button in the editor, in real games you call a function in the RoomManager to convert the level, called ``rooms_convert()``. Try this out with a script, perhaps running within a ``_ready()`` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/portals/rooms_and_portals_example.rst:89
msgid "The geometry you created so far is all ``STATIC`` (non-moving). If you look in the inspector for geometry nodes, you will see they derive from ``CullInstance``. Here you can set the **Portal Mode** for objects in the portal system. This determines how the node is processed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/portals/rooms_and_portals_example.rst:90
msgid "If you now write a script to move one of your objects within a room and view it through a Camera as the scene runs, you may notice that the object gets culled incorrectly. This is because ``STATIC`` objects are assumed not to move in the system. If you instead change the object to ``DYNAMIC``, it should now update the culling correctly."
