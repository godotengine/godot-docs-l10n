msgid "Anytime you want to use the portal system, you need to include a special node in your scene tree, called the :ref:`RoomManager<class_RoomManager>`. The RoomManager is responsible for the runtime maintenance of the system, especially converting the objects in your rooms into a *room graph* which is used at runtime to perform occlusion culling and other tasks."

msgid "This conversion must take place every time you want to activate the system. It does not store the *room graph* in your project (for flexibility and to save memory). You can either trigger it by pressing the **Convert Rooms** button in the editor toolbar (which also has a keyboard shortcut) or by calling the ``rooms_convert()`` method in the RoomManager. The latter method will be what you use in-game. Note that for safety, best practice is to call ``rooms_clear()`` before unloading or changing levels."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/portals/first_steps_with_rooms_and_portals.rst:16
msgid "If you convert the level while the editor is running, the portal culling system will take over from the normal Godot frustum culling, potentially interfering with editor features. To get around this, you can turn portal culling on and off using either the **View Portal Culling** toggle in the **View** menu on the editor toolbar (which also has a keyboard shortcut) or the **Active** setting in the RoomManager node."

msgid ":ref:`Room<class_Room>`\\ s are a way of spatially partitioning your level into areas that make sense in terms of level design. Rooms often quite literally *are* rooms (like in a building). Ultimately though, as far as the engine is concerned, a room represents a **non-overlapping** convex volume in which you typically place most of your objects that fall within that area."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/portals/first_steps_with_rooms_and_portals.rst:50
msgid "Rooms are defined as convex volumes (or *convex hulls*) because it's trivial to mathematically determine whether a point is within a convex hull. A simple plane check will tell you the distance of a point from a plane. If a point is behind all the planes bounding the convex hull, then by definition it is inside the room. This makes all kinds of things easier in the internals of the system, such as checking which room a camera is within."

msgid "If two rooms overlap, and a camera or player is in this overlapping zone, then there is no way to tell which room the object should be in (and hence render from), or be rendered in. This requirement for non-overlapping rooms does have implications for level design."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/portals/first_steps_with_rooms_and_portals.rst:65
msgid "The system does attempt to cope with overlapping rooms as best as possible by making the current room *\"sticky\"*. Each object remembers which room it was in during the previous frame and stays within it as long as it does not move outside the convex hull room bound. This can result in some hysteresis in these overlapping zones."

msgid ":ref:`Portal<class_Portal>`\\ s are special convex polygons that you position over the openings between rooms in order to allow the system to see between them. You can create a portal node directly in the editor. The default portal has 4 points and behaves much like a ``plane`` :ref:`MeshInstance<class_MeshInstance>`. You can add or remove points using the inspector. A portal requires at least 3 points to work - this is because it needs to form a polygon rather than a point or line."
