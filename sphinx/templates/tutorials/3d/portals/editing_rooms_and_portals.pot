There is one small snag - modeling tools such as Blender have no knowledge of Room, RoomGroup and Portal nodes. In order to work around this we use a series of naming conventions. The first time Godot encounters these specially named nodes, it will convert them into Rooms, RoomGroups and Portals."

You would typically create them by pressing the **Generate Points** button in the editor toolbar when a room is selected. This will transfer the auto bound from the geometry (or manual ``-bound`` mesh) into the inspector. Once there are points in the inspector, they will be used and override any other method. So if you wish to revert your manual editing, delete all the room's points."

Typical examples might be terrain mesh areas, or large floor or ceiling meshes. You usually don't want things like door frames to sprawl to the adjacent room - that is what fine tuning the **Portal Margin** is for."

msgid "To keep drawcalls to a minimum, the system offers the option to automatically merge similar ``STATIC`` meshes within a room (also known as *static batching*). This can increase performance in many cases. The culling accuracy is reduced, but as a room is a fairly logical unit for culling, this trade off usually works in your favor."

msgid "In some cases, the convex hulls automatically generated for rooms may contain a very large number of planes, particularly if you use curved surfaces. This is not ideal because it slows down the system. This option can optionally simplify hulls. The degree of simplification can be selected by the user, between ``0`` (no simplification) and ``1`` (maximum simplification). You can also override this value in individual rooms."

For example, you can use one-way portals to create windows that can be seen out of, but not seen into. This can help performance when viewing buildings from outdoors."
