msgid ":ref:`Gridmaps <class_GridMap>` are a tool for creating 3D game levels, similar to the way :ref:`TileMap <doc_using_tilemaps>` works in 2D. You start with a predefined collection of 3D meshes (a :ref:`class_MeshLibrary`) that can be placed on a grid, as if you were building a level with an unlimited amount of Lego blocks."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:15
msgid "Collisions and navigation can also be added to the meshes, just like you would do with the tiles of a tilemap."

msgid "Creating a MeshLibrary"

msgid "To begin, you need a :ref:`class_MeshLibrary`, which is a collection of individual meshes that can be used in the gridmap. Open the \"MeshLibrary_Source.tscn\" scene to see an example of how to set up the mesh library."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:36
msgid "As you can see, this scene has a :ref:`class_Spatial` node as its root, and a number of :ref:`class_MeshInstance` node children."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:39
msgid "If you don't need any physics in your scene, then you're done. However, in most cases you'll want to assign collision bodies to the meshes."

msgid "Collisions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:45
msgid "You can manually assign a :ref:`class_StaticBody` and :ref:`class_CollisionShape` to each mesh. Alternatively, you can use the \"Mesh\" menu to automatically create the collision body based on the mesh data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:51
msgid "Note that a \"Convex\" collision body will work better for simple meshes. For more complex shapes, select \"Create Trimesh Static Body\". Once each mesh has a physics body and collision shape assigned, your mesh library is ready to be used."

msgid "Like all mesh instances, MeshLibrary items can be assigned a :ref:`class_NavigationMesh` resource, which can be created manually, or baked as described below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:71
msgid "To create the NavigationMesh from a MeshLibrary scene export, place a :ref:`class_NavigationMeshInstance` child node below the main MeshInstance for the GridMap item. Add a valid NavigationMesh resource to the NavigationMeshInstance and some source geometry nodes below and bake the NavigationMesh."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:78
msgid "With small grid cells it is often necessary to reduce the NavigationMesh properties for agent radius and region minimum size."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:83
msgid "Nodes below the NavigationMeshInstance are ignored for the MeshLibrary scene export, so additional nodes can be added as source geometry just for baking the navmesh."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:88
msgid "The baked cell size of the NavigationMesh must match the NavigationServer map cell size to properly merge the navigation meshes of different grid cells."
