msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/playing_videos.rst:168
msgid "Some programs such as Blender can render to Ogg Theora. However, the default quality presets are usually very low by today's standards. You may be able to increase the quality options in the software you're using, but you may find the output quality to remain less than ideal (given the increased file size). This usually means that the software only supports encoding to constant bit rate (CBR), instead of variable bit rate (VBR). VBR encoding should be preferred in most scenarios as it provides a better quality to file size ratio."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/playing_videos.rst:176
msgid "Some other programs can't render to Ogg Theora at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/playing_videos.rst:178
msgid "In this case, you can **render the video to an intermediate high-quality format** (such as a high-bitrate H.264 video) then re-encode it to Ogg Theora. Ideally, you should use a lossless or uncompressed format as an intermediate format to maximize the quality of the output Ogg Theora video, but this can require a lot of disk space."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/playing_videos.rst:201
msgid "The **video quality** level (``-q:v``) must be between ``1`` and ``10``. Quality ``6`` is a good compromise between quality and file size. If encoding at a high resolution (such as 1440p or 4K), you will probably want to decrease ``-q:v`` to ``5`` to keep file sizes reasonable. Since pixel density is higher on a 1440p or 4K video, lower quality presets at higher resolutions will look as good or better compared to low-resolution videos."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/playing_videos.rst:208
msgid "The **audio quality** level (``-q:a``) must be between ``-1`` and ``10``. Quality ``6`` provides a good compromise between quality and file size. In contrast to video quality, increasing audio quality doesn't increase the output file size nearly as much. Therefore, if you want the cleanest audio possible, you can increase this to ``9`` to get *perceptually lossless* audio. This is especially valuable if your input file already uses lossy audio compression. Higher quality audio does increase the CPU usage of the decoder, so it might lead to audio dropouts in case of high system load. See `this page <https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Recommended_Ogg_Vorbis#Recommended_Encoder_Settings>`__ for a table listing Ogg Vorbis audio quality presets and their respective variable bitrates."
