msgid "When working with 3D, skeletal deforms are common for characters and creatures and most 3D modeling applications support it. For 2D, as this function is not used as often, it's difficult to find mainstream software aimed for this."
msgstr ""

msgid "One option is to create animations in third-party software such as Spine or Dragonbones. From Godot 3.1 onwards, though, this functionality is supported built-in."

msgid "Why would you want to do skeletal animations directly in Godot? The answer is that there are many advantages to it:"

msgid "Create a new scene for your model (if it's going to be an animated character, you may want to use a ``CharacterBody2D``). For ease of use, an empty 2D node is created as a root for the polygons."

msgid "Keep doing this until you mapped all pieces."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons.rst:95
msgid "You will notice that pieces for nodes appear in the same layout as they do in the original texture. This is because by default, when you draw a polygon, the UV and points are the same."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons.rst:99
msgid "Rearrange the pieces and build the character. This should be pretty quick. There is no need to change pivots, so don't bother making sure rotation pivots for each piece are right; you can leave them be for now."

msgid "At the end of this chain, there will be a *jaw* node. It is, again, very short and pointing to the right. This is normal for bones without children. The length of *tip* bones can be changed with a property in the inspector:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons.rst:136
msgid "In this case, we don't need to rotate the bone (coincidentally the jaw points right in the sprite), but in case you need to, feel free to do it. Again, this is only really needed for tip bones as nodes with children don't usually need a length or a specific rotation."

msgid "Keep going and build the whole skeleton:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons.rst:145
msgid "You will notice that all bones raise an annoying warning about a missing rest pose. This means that it's time to set one. Go to the *skeleton* node and create a rest pose. This pose is the default one, you can come back to it anytime you want (which is very handy for animating):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons.rst:152

msgid "You will not be able to paint weights yet. For this you need to synchronize the list of bones from the skeleton with the polygon. This step is done only once and manually (unless you modify the skeleton by adding/removing/renaming bones). It ensures that your rigging information is kept in the polygon, even if a skeleton node is accidentally lost or the skeleton modified. Push the \"Sync Bones to Polygon\" button to sync the list."
msgstr ""

msgid "The list of bones will automatically appear. By default, your polygon has no weight assigned to any of them. Select the bones you want to assign weight to and paint them:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons.rst:187
msgid "Points in white have a full weight assigned, while points in black are not influenced by the bone. If the same point is painted white for multiple bones, the influence will be distributed amongst them (so usually there is not that much need to use shades in-between unless you want to polish the bending effect)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons.rst:195
msgid "After painting the weights, animating the bones (NOT the polygons!) will have the desired effect of modifying and bending the polygons accordingly. As you only need to animate bones in this approach, work becomes much easier!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons.rst:199
msgid "But it's not all roses. Trying to animate bones that bend the polygon will often yield unexpected results:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons.rst:204
msgid "This happens because Godot generates internal triangles that connect the points when drawing the polygon. They don't always bend the way you would expect. To solve this, you need to set hints in the geometry to clarify how you expect it to deform."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons.rst:217
msgid "Now, go to the *Polygon* section and redraw your own polygons with more detail. Imagine that, as your polygons bend, you need to make sure they deform the least possible, so experiment a bit to find the right setup."
