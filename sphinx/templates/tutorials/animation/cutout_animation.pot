#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/cutout_animation.rst:11
msgid "Traditionally, `cutout animation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutout_animation>`__ is a type of `stop motion animation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion>`__ in which pieces of paper (or other thin material) are cut into special shapes and arranged in two-dimensional representations of characters and objects. Characters' bodies are usually made out of several pieces. The pieces are arranged and photographed once for each frame of the film. The animator moves and rotates the parts in small increments between each shot to create the illusion of movement when the images are played back quickly in sequence."

msgid "**Combine animation styles**: AnimatedSprite2D allows traditional cel animation to be used alongside cutout animation. In cel animation different animation frames use entirely different drawings rather than the same pieces positioned differently. In an otherwise cutout-based animation, cel animation can be used selectively for complex parts such as hands, feet, changing facial expressions, etc."

msgid "IK stands for inverse kinematics. It's a convenient technique for animating the position of hands, feet and other extremities of rigs like the one we've made. Imagine you want to pose a character's foot in a specific position on the ground. Without IK chains, each motion of the foot would require rotating and positioning several other bones (the shin and the thigh at least). This would be quite complex and lead to imprecise results. IK allows us to move the foot directly while the shin and thigh self-adjust."

You want to add an overlapping rotation movement to the same node. The rotation movement should begin and end at different times from the scale change that's already set up. You can use the toggle buttons to have only rotation information added when you add a new keyframe.
