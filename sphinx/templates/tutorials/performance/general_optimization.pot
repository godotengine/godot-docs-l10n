msgid "*Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.*"

msgid "The messages are very important:"

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:147
msgid "Developer time is limited. Instead of blindly trying to speed up all aspects of a program, we should concentrate our efforts on the aspects that really matter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:150
msgid "Efforts at optimization often end up with code that is harder to read and debug than non-optimized code. It is in our interests to limit this to areas that will really benefit."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:154
msgid "Just because we *can* optimize a particular bit of code, it doesn't necessarily mean that we *should*. Knowing when and when not to optimize is a great skill to develop."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:158
msgid "One misleading aspect of the quote is that people tend to focus on the subquote *\"premature optimization is the root of all evil\"*. While *premature* optimization is (by definition) undesirable, performant software is the result of performant design."
msgstr ""

msgid "Performant design"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:166
msgid "The danger with encouraging people to ignore optimization until necessary, is that it conveniently ignores that the most important time to consider performance is at the design stage, before a key has even hit a keyboard. If the design or algorithms of a program are inefficient, then no amount of polishing the details later will make it run fast. It may run *faster*, but it will never run as fast as a program designed for performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:173
msgid "This tends to be far more important in game or graphics programming than in general programming. A performant design, even without low-level optimization, will often run many times faster than a mediocre design with low-level optimization."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:179
msgid "Incremental design"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:181
msgid "Of course, in practice, unless you have prior knowledge, you are unlikely to come up with the best design the first time. Instead, you'll often make a series of versions of a particular area of code, each taking a different approach to the problem, until you come to a satisfactory solution. It's important not to spend too much time on the details at this stage until you have finalized the overall design. Otherwise, much of your work will be thrown out."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:188
msgid "It's difficult to give general guidelines for performant design because this is so dependent on the problem. One point worth mentioning though, on the CPU side, is that modern CPUs are nearly always limited by memory bandwidth. This has led to a resurgence in data-oriented design, which involves designing data structures and algorithms for *cache locality* of data and linear access, rather than jumping around in memory."
msgstr ""

msgid "The optimization process"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:198
msgid "Assuming we have a reasonable design, and taking our lessons from Knuth, our first step in optimization should be to identify the biggest bottlenecks - the slowest functions, the low-hanging fruit."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:202
msgid "Once we've successfully improved the speed of the slowest area, it may no longer be the bottleneck. So we should test/profile again and find the next bottleneck on which to focus."

msgid "Some profilers will even tell you which part of a function (which data accesses, calculations) are slowing things down."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:218
msgid "As with design, you should concentrate your efforts first on making sure the algorithms and data structures are the best they can be. Data access should be local (to make best use of CPU cache), and it can often be better to use compact storage of data (again, always profile to test results). Often, you precalculate heavy computations ahead of time. This can be done by performing the computation when loading a level, by loading a file containing precalculated data or simply by storing the results of complex calculations into a script constant and reading its value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:227
msgid "Once algorithms and data are good, you can often make small changes in routines which improve performance. For instance, you can move some calculations outside of loops or transform nested ``for`` loops into non-nested loops. (This should be feasible if you know a 2D array's width or height in advance.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:232
msgid "Always retest your timing/bottlenecks after making each change. Some changes will increase speed, others may have a negative effect. Sometimes, a small positive effect will be outweighed by the negatives of more complex code, and you may choose to leave out that optimization."

msgid "The proverb *\"a chain is only as strong as its weakest link\"* applies directly to performance optimization. If your project is spending 90% of the time in function ``A``, then optimizing ``A`` can have a massive effect on performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:259
msgid "In this example, improving this bottleneck ``A`` by a factor of 9× decreases overall frame time by 5× while increasing frames per second by 5×."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:262
msgid "However, if something else is running slowly and also bottlenecking your project, then the same improvement can lead to less dramatic gains:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:277
msgid "In this example, even though we have hugely optimized function ``A``, the actual gain in terms of frame rate is quite small."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:280
msgid "In games, things become even more complicated because the CPU and GPU run independently of one another. Your total frame time is determined by the slower of the two."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/general_optimization.rst:296
