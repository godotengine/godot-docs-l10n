msgid "This page explains how file paths work inside Godot projects. You will learn how to access paths in your projects using the ``res://`` and ``user://`` notations, and where Godot stores project and editor files on your and your users' systems."

msgid "Path separators"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:13
msgid "To make supporting multiple platforms easier, Godot uses **UNIX-style path separators** (forward slash ``/``). These work on all platforms, **including Windows**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:17
msgid "Instead of writing paths like ``C:\\Projects\\Game``, in Godot, you should write ``C:/Projects/Game``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:20
msgid "Windows-style path separators (backward slash ``\\``) are also supported in some path-related methods, but they need to be doubled (``\\\\``), as ``\\`` is normally used as an escape for characters with a special meaning."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:24
msgid "This makes it possible to work with paths returned by other Windows applications. We still recommend using only forward slashes in your own code to guarantee that everything will work as intended."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing files in the project folder (``res://``)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:31
msgid "Godot considers that a project exists in any folder that contains a ``project.godot`` text file, even if the file is empty. The folder that contains this file is your project's root folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:35
msgid "You can access any file relative to it by writing paths starting with ``res://``, which stands for resources. For example, you can access an image file ``character.png`` located in the project's root folder in code with the following path: ``res://character.png``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:41
msgid "Accessing persistent user data (``user://``)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:43
msgid "To store persistent data files, like the player's save or settings, you want to use ``user://`` instead of ``res://`` as your path's prefix. This is because when the game is running, the project's file system will likely be read-only."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:47
msgid "The ``user://`` prefix points to a different directory on the user's device. Unlike ``res://``, the directory pointed at by ``user://`` is created automatically and *guaranteed* to be writable to, even in an exported project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:51
msgid "The location of the ``user://`` folder depends on what is configured in the Project Settings:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:54
msgid "By default, the ``user://`` folder is created within Godot's :ref:`editor data path <doc_data_paths_editor_data_paths>` in the ``app_userdata/[project_name]`` folder. This is the default so that prototypes and test projects stay self-contained within Godot's data folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:58
msgid "If :ref:`application/config/use_custom_user_dir <class_ProjectSettings_property_application/config/use_custom_user_dir>` is enabled in the Project Settings, the ``user://`` folder is created **next to** Godot's editor data path, i.e. in the standard location for applications data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:63
msgid "By default, the folder name will be inferred from the project name, but it can be further customized with :ref:`application/config/custom_user_dir_name <class_ProjectSettings_property_application/config/custom_user_dir_name>`. This path can contain path separators, so you can use it e.g. to group projects of a given studio with a ``Studio Name/Game Name`` structure."

For example, :ref:`ProjectSettings.globalize_path() <class_ProjectSettings_method_globalize_path>` can be used to open \"local\" paths in the OS file manager using :ref:`OS.shell_open() <class_OS_method_shell_open>` since it only accepts native OS paths."
