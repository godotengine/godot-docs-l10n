msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:73
msgid "If you are just starting out with either Godot or game development in general, GDScript is the recommended language to learn and use since it is native to Godot. While scripting languages tend to be less performant than lower-level languages in the long run, for prototyping, developing Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), and focusing on Time-To-Market (TTM), GDScript will provide a fast, friendly, and capable way of developing your games."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:80
msgid "Note that C# support is still relatively new, and as such, you may encounter some issues along the way. Our friendly and hard-working development community is always ready to tackle new problems as they arise, but since this is an open-source project, we recommend that you first do some due diligence yourself. Searching through discussions on `open issues <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues>`_ is a great way to start your troubleshooting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:87
msgid "As for new languages, support is possible via third parties using the GDNative / NativeScript / PluginScript facilities. (See the question about plugins below.)

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:97
msgid "GDScript is Godot's integrated scripting language. It was built from the ground up to maximize Godot's potential in the least amount of code, affording both novice and expert developers alike to capitalize on Godot's strengths as fast as possible. If you've ever written anything in a language like Python before then you'll feel right at home. For examples, history, and a complete overview of the power GDScript offers you, check out the :ref:`GDScript scripting guide <doc_gdscript>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:104
msgid "There are several reasons to use GDScript--especially when you are prototyping, in alpha/beta stages of your project, or are not creating the next AAA title--but the most salient reason is the overall **reduction of complexity**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:108
msgid "The original intent of creating a tightly integrated, custom scripting language for Godot was two-fold: first, it reduces the amount of time necessary to get up and running with Godot, giving developers a rapid way of exposing themselves to the engine with a focus on productivity; second, it reduces the overall burden of maintenance, attenuates the dimensionality of issues, and allows the developers of the engine to focus on squashing bugs and improving features related to the engine core--rather than spending a lot of time trying to get a small set of incremental features working across a large set of languages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:116
msgid "Since Godot is an open-source project, it was imperative from the start to prioritize a more integrated and seamless experience over attracting additional users by supporting more familiar programming languages--especially when supporting those more familiar languages would result in a worse experience. We understand if you would rather use another language in Godot (see the list of supported options above). That being said, if you haven't given GDScript a try, try it for **three days**. Just like Godot, once you see how powerful it is and rapid your development becomes, we think GDScript will grow on you."

msgid "What were the motivations behind creating GDScript?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:131
msgid "In the early days, the engine used the `Lua <https://www.lua.org>`__ scripting language. Lua is fast, but creating bindings to an object oriented system (by using fallbacks) was complex and slow and took an enormous amount of code. After some experiments with `Python <https://www.python.org>`__, it also proved difficult to embed."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:141
msgid "Poor class-extending support in most script VMs, and adapting to the way Godot works is highly inefficient (Lua, Python, JavaScript)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:143
msgid "Many existing languages have horrible interfaces for binding to C++, resulting in large amount of code, bugs, bottlenecks, and general inefficiency (Lua, Python, Squirrel, JavaScript, etc.) We wanted to focus on a great engine, not a great amount of integrations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:146
msgid "No native vector types (vector3, matrix4, etc.), resulting in highly reduced performance when using custom types (Lua, Python, Squirrel, JavaScript, ActionScript, etc.)."

msgid "Will [insert closed SDK such as FMOD, GameWorks, etc.] be supported in Godot?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:171
msgid "The aim of Godot is to create a free and open-source MIT-licensed engine that is modular and extendable. There are no plans for the core engine development community to support any third-party, closed-source/proprietary SDKs, as integrating with these would go against Godot's ethos."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:176
msgid "That said, because Godot is open-source and modular, nothing prevents you or anyone else interested in adding those libraries as a module and shipping your game with them--as either open- or closed-source."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:247
msgid "However, configuration files will be written to the user-wide configuration or data directory. This is usually a good approach, but this means configuration files will not carry across machines if you copy the folder containing the Godot executable.

msgid "Why does Godot use Vulkan or OpenGL instead of Direct3D?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:258
msgid "Godot aims for cross-platform compatibility and open standards first and foremost. OpenGL and Vulkan are the technologies that are both open and available (nearly) on all platforms. Thanks to this design decision, a project developed with Godot on Windows will run out of the box on Linux, macOS, and more."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:264
msgid "Since Godot only has a few people working on its renderer, we would prefer having fewer rendering backends to maintain. On top of that, using a single API on all platforms allows for greater consistency with fewer platform-specific issues."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:269
msgid "In the long term, we may develop a Direct3D 12 renderer for Godot (mainly for the Xbox's purposes), but Vulkan and OpenGL will remain the default rendering backends on all platforms, including Windows."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:274
msgid "Why does Godot aim to keep its core feature set small?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:276
msgid "Godot intentionally does not include features that can be implemented by add-ons unless they are used very often. One example of this would be advanced artificial intelligence functionality."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:280
msgid "There are several reasons for this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:282
msgid "**Code maintenance and surface for bugs.** Every time we accept new code in the Godot repository, existing contributors often take the reponsibility of maintaining it. Some contributors don't always stick around after getting their code merged, which can make it difficult for us to maintain the code in question. This can lead to poorly maintained features with bugs that are never fixed. On top of that, the \"API surface\" that needs to be tested and checked for regressions keeps increasing over time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:290
msgid "**Ease of contribution.** By keeping the codebase small and tidy, it can remain fast and easy to compile from source. This makes it easier for new contributors to get started with Godot, without requiring them to purchase high-end hardware."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:295
msgid "**Keeping the binary size small for the editor.** Not everyone has a fast Internet connection. Ensuring that everyone can download the Godot editor, extract it and run it in less than 5 minutes makes Godot more accessible to developers in all countries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:300
msgid "**Keeping the binary size small for export templates.** This directly impacts the size of projects exported with Godot. On mobile and web platforms, keeping file sizes low is primordial to ensure fast installation and loading on underpowered devices. Again, there are many countries where high-speed Internet is not readily available. To add to this, strict data usage caps are often in effect in those countries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:307
msgid "For all the reasons above, we have to be selective of what we can accept as core functionality in Godot. This is why we are aiming to move some core functionality to officially supported add-ons in future versions of Godot. In terms of binary size, this also has the advantage of making you pay only for what you actually use in your project. (In the meantime, you can :ref:`compile custom export templates with unused features disabled <doc_optimizing_for_size>` to optimize the distribution size of your project.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:316
msgid "How should assets be created to handle multiple resolutions and aspect ratios?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:318
msgid "This question pops up often and it's probably thanks to the misunderstanding created by Apple when they originally doubled the resolution of their devices. It made people think that having the same assets in different resolutions was a good idea, so many continued towards that path. That originally worked to a point and only for Apple devices, but then several Android and Apple devices with different resolutions and aspect ratios were created, with a very wide range of sizes and DPIs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:326
msgid "The most common and proper way to achieve this is to, instead, use a single base resolution for the game and only handle different screen aspect ratios. This is mostly needed for 2D, as in 3D it's just a matter of Camera XFov or YFov."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:330
msgid "Choose a single base resolution for your game. Even if there are devices that go up to 2K and devices that go down to 400p, regular hardware scaling in your device will take care of this at little or no performance cost. Most common choices are either near 1080p (1920x1080) or 720p (1280x720). Keep in mind the higher the resolution, the larger your assets, the more memory they will take and the longer the time it will take for loading."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:338

msgid "Godot is meant to be used with its editor. We recommend you give it a try, as it will most likely save you time in the long term. There are no plans to make Godot usable as a library, as it would make the rest of the engine more convoluted and difficult to use for casual users."

msgid "If you want to use a rendering library, look into using an established rendering engine instead. Keep in mind rendering engines usually have smaller communities compared to Godot. This will make it more difficult to find answers to your questions."

msgid "What user interface toolkit does Godot use?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:464
msgid "Godot does not use a standard :abbr:`GUI (Graphical User Interface)` toolkit like GTK, Qt or wxWidgets. Instead, Godot uses its own user interface toolkit, rendered using OpenGL ES or Vulkan. This toolkit is exposed in the form of Control nodes, which are used to render the editor (which is written in C++). These Control nodes can also be used in projects from any scripting language supported by Godot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:471
msgid "This custom toolkit makes it possible to benefit from hardware acceleration and have a consistent appearance across all platforms. On top of that, it doesn't have to deal with the LGPL licensing caveats that come with GTK or Qt. Lastly, this means Godot is \"eating its own dog food\" since the editor itself is one of the most complex users of Godot's UI system."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:486
msgid "Like many other libraries (Qt as an example), Godot does not make use of STL. We believe STL is a great general purpose library, but we had special requirements for Godot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:490
msgid "STL templates create very large symbols, which results in huge debug binaries. We use few templates with very short names instead."

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:491
msgid "Most of our containers cater to special needs, like Vector, which uses copy on write and we use to pass data around, or the RID system, which requires O(1) access time for performance. Likewise, our hash map implementations are designed to integrate seamlessly with internal engine types."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:499
msgid "We believe games should not crash, no matter what. If an unexpected situation happens, Godot will print an error (which can be traced even to script), but then it will try to recover as gracefully as possible and keep going."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/faq.rst:521
msgid "DoD is mostly a cache coherency optimization that can only gain you significant performance improvements when dealing with dozens of thousands of objects (which are processed every frame with little modification). As in, if you are moving a few hundred sprites or enemies per frame, DoD won't help you, and you should consider a different approach to optimization."
