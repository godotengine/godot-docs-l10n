msgid "You should use the graphics driver provided by Intel rather than the one provided by your desktop or laptop's manufacturer because their version is often outdated."

msgid "This is a `known bug <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20566>`__ on Windows when you have specific USB peripherals connected. In particular, Corsair's iCUE software seems to cause the bug. Try updating your USB peripherals' drivers to their latest version. If the bug persists, you need to disconnect the faulty peripherals before opening the editor. You can then connect the peripheral again."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/troubleshooting.rst:56
msgid "When running Godot on Windows with the system console enabled, you can accidentally enable *selection mode* by clicking inside the command window. This Windows-specific behavior pauses the application to let you select text inside the system console. Godot cannot override this system-specific behavior."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/troubleshooting.rst:78
msgid "Unlike the editor, the project isn't marked as DPI-aware by default. This is done to improve performance, especially on integrated graphics, where rendering 3D scenes in hiDPI is slow."

msgid "The project works when run from the editor, but fails to load some files when running from an exported copy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/troubleshooting.rst:97
msgid "This is usually caused by forgetting to specify a filter for non-resource files in the Export dialog. By default, Godot will only include actual *resources* into the PCK file. Some files commonly used, such as JSON files, are not considered resources. For example, if you load ``test.json`` in the exported project, you need to specify ``*.json`` in the non-resource export filter. See :ref:`doc_exporting_projects_export_mode` for more information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/about/troubleshooting.rst:104
msgid "On Windows, this can also be due to :ref:`case sensitivity <doc_project_organization_case_sensitivity>` issues. If you reference a resource in your script with a different case than on the filesystem, loading will fail once you export the project. This is because the virtual PCK filesystem is case-sensitive, while Windows's filesystem is case-insensitive by default."
