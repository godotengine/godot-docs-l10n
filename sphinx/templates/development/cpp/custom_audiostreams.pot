msgid "All audio resources require two audio based classes: AudioStream and AudioStreamPlayback. As a data container, AudioStream contains the resource and exposes itself to GDScript. AudioStream references its own internal custom AudioStreamPlayback which translates AudioStream into PCM data."

msgid "An AudioStream consists of three components: data container, stream name, and an AudioStreamPlayback friend class generator. Audio data can be loaded in a number of ways such as with an internal counter for a tone generator, internal/external buffer, or a file reference."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/development/cpp/custom_audiostreams.rst:43
msgid "Some AudioStreams need to be stateless such as objects loaded from ResourceLoader. ResourceLoader loads once and references the same object regardless how many times ``load`` is called on a specific resource. Therefore, playback state must be self-contained in AudioStreamPlayback."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/development/cpp/custom_audiostreams.rst:238
msgid "Instead of overloading ``mix``, AudioStreamPlaybackResampled uses ``_mix_internal`` to query AudioFrames and ``get_stream_sampling_rate`` to query current mix rate."
