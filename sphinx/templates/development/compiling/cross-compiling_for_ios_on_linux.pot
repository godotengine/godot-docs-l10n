msgid "While it is possible to compile for iOS on a Linux environment, Apple is very restrictive about the tools to be used (especially hardware-wise), allowing pretty much only their products to be used for development. So this is **not official**. However, a `statement from Apple in 2010 <http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/09Statement-by-Apple-on-App-Store-Review-Guidelines.html>`__ says they relaxed some of the `App Store review guidelines <https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/>`__ to allow any tool to be used, as long as the resulting binary does not download any code, which means it should be OK to use the procedure described here and cross-compiling the binary."
