msgid "Godot uses the standard C99 datatypes, such as ``uint8_t``, ``uint32_t``, ``int64_t``, etc. which are nowadays supported by every compiler. Reinventing the wheel for those is not fun, as it makes code more difficult to read."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/contributing/development/core_and_modules/core_types.rst:20
msgid "In general, care is not taken to use the most efficient datatype for a given task unless using large structures or arrays. ``int`` is used through most of the code unless necessary. This is done because nowadays every device has at least a 32 bits bus and can do such operations in one cycle. It makes code more readable too."

msgid "For Unicode characters, CharType instead of wchar_t is used, because many architectures have 4 bytes long wchar_t, where 2 bytes might be desired. However, by default, this has not been forced and CharType maps directly to wchar_t."

#: ../../docs/contributing/development/core_and_modules/core_types.rst:42
msgid "PC is a wonderful architecture. Computers often have gigabytes of RAM, terabytes of storage and gigahertz of CPU, and when an application needs more resources the OS will swap out the inactive ones. Other architectures (like mobile or consoles) are in general more limited."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/contributing/development/core_and_modules/core_types.rst:47
msgid "The most common memory model is the heap, where an application will request a region of memory, and the underlying OS will try to fit it somewhere and return it. This often works best and is flexible, but over time and with abuse, this can lead to segmentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/contributing/development/core_and_modules/core_types.rst:52
msgid "Segmentation slowly creates holes that are too small for most common allocations, so that memory is wasted. There is a lot of literature about heap and segmentation, so this topic will not be developed further here. Modern operating systems use paged memory, which helps mitigate the problem of segmentation but doesn't solve it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/contributing/development/core_and_modules/core_types.rst:58
msgid "However, in many studies and tests, it is shown that given enough memory, if the maximum allocation size is below a given threshold in proportion to the maximum heap size and proportion of memory intended to be unused, segmentation will not be a problem over time as it will remain constant. In other words, leave 10-20% of your memory free and perform all small allocations and you are fine."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/contributing/development/core_and_modules/core_types.rst:65
msgid "Godot ensures that all objects that can be allocated dynamically are small (less than a few kb at most). But what happens if an allocation is too large (like an image or mesh geometry or large array)? In this case Godot has the option to use a dynamic memory pool. This memory needs to be locked to be accessed, and if an allocation runs out of memory, the pool will be rearranged and compacted on demand. Depending on the need of the game, the programmer can configure the dynamic memory pool size."
