msgid "Variant is the most important datatype of Godot, it's the most important class in the engine. A Variant takes up only 20 bytes and can store almost any engine datatype inside of it. Variants are rarely used to hold information for long periods of time, instead they are used mainly for communication, editing, serialization and generally moving data around."
