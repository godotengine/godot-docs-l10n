"all GPUs in use yet."

"WebM is supported in core in Godot 3.x, but support for it will be removed "

"Video decoding is performed on the CPU, as GPUs don't have hardware "

msgid ""
"When developing games for desktop platforms, it's recommended to encode in "
"1080p at most (preferably at 30 FPS). Most people are still using 1080p or "
"lower resolution displays, so encoding higher-resolution videos may not be "
"worth the increased file size and CPU requirements."

msgid ""
"When developing games for mobile or web platforms, it's recommended to "
"encode in 720p at most (preferably at 30 FPS or even lower). The visual "
"difference between 720p and 1080p videos on a mobile device is usually not "

"Looping is not supported, but you can connect a VideoPlayer's :ref:`finished "
"<class_VideoPlayer_signal_finished>` signal to a function that plays the "
"video again. However, this will cause a black frame to be visible when the "
"video restarts. This can be worked around by adding a fade to black in the "
"video file before the video ends, or by hiding the video for one frame and "
"displaying a TextureRect with a screenshot of the first frame of the video "

msgid "Recommended Theora encoding settings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A word of advice is to **avoid relying on built-in Ogg Theora exporters** "
"(most of the time). There are 2 reasons you may want to favor using an "
"external program to encode your video:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some programs such as Blender can render to Ogg Theora. However, the default "
"quality presets are usually very low by today's standards. You may be able "
"to increase the quality options in the software you're using, but you may "
"find the output quality to remain less than ideal (given the increased file "
"size). This usually means that the software only supports encoding to "
"constant bit rate (CBR), instead of variable bit rate (VBR). VBR encoding "
"should be preferred in most scenarios as it provides a better quality to "
"file size ratio."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some other programs can't render to Ogg Theora at all."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case, you can **render the video to an intermediate high-quality "
"format** (such as a high-bitrate H.264 video) then re-encode it to Ogg "
"Theora. Ideally, you should use a lossless or uncompressed format as an "
"intermediate format to maximize the quality of the output Ogg Theora video, "
"but this can require a lot of disk space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`HandBrake <https://handbrake.fr/>`__ (GUI) and `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/"
">`__ (CLI) are popular open source tools for this purpose. FFmpeg has a "
"steeper learning curve, but it's more powerful."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here are example FFmpeg commands to convert a MP4 video to Ogg Theora. Since "
"FFmpeg supports a lot of input formats, you should be able to use the "
"commands below with almost any input video format (AVI, MOV, WebM, …)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure your copy of FFmpeg is compiled with libtheora and libvorbis "
"support. You can check this by running ``ffmpeg`` without any arguments, "
"then looking at the ``configuration:`` line in the command output."
msgstr ""

msgid "Balancing quality and file size"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **video quality** level (``-q:v``) must be between ``1`` and ``10``. "
"Quality ``6`` is a good compromise between quality and file size. If "
"encoding at a high resolution (such as 1440p or 4K), you will probably want "
"to decrease ``-q:v`` to ``5`` to keep file sizes reasonable. Since pixel "
"density is higher on a 1440p or 4K video, lower quality presets at higher "
"resolutions will look as good or better compared to low-resolution videos."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **audio quality** level (``-q:a``) must be between ``-1`` and ``10``. "
"Quality ``6`` provides a good compromise between quality and file size. In "
"contrast to video quality, increasing audio quality doesn't increase the "
"output file size nearly as much. Therefore, if you want the cleanest audio "
"possible, you can increase this to ``9`` to get *perceptually lossless* "
"audio. This is especially valuable if your input file already uses lossy "
"audio compression. See `this page <https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?"
"title=Recommended_Ogg_Vorbis#Recommended_Encoder_Settings>`__ for a table "
"listing Ogg Vorbis audio quality presets and their respective variable "
"bitrates."
