msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "はじめに"

msgid ""
"The demand for new graphics features and progress almost guarantees that you "
"will encounter graphics bottlenecks. Some of these can be on the CPU side, "
"for instance in calculations inside the Godot engine to prepare objects for "
"rendering. Bottlenecks can also occur on the CPU in the graphics driver, "
"which sorts instructions to pass to the GPU, and in the transfer of these "
"instructions. And finally, bottlenecks also occur on the GPU itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Where bottlenecks occur in rendering is highly hardware-specific. Mobile "
"GPUs in particular may struggle with scenes that run easily on desktop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Understanding and investigating GPU bottlenecks is slightly different to the "
"situation on the CPU. This is because, often, you can only change "
"performance indirectly by changing the instructions you give to the GPU. "
"Also, it may be more difficult to take measurements. In many cases, the only "
"way of measuring performance is by examining changes in the time spent "
"rendering each frame."
msgstr ""

msgid "Draw calls, state changes, and APIs"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following section is not relevant to end-users, but is useful to provide "
"background information that is relevant in later sections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot sends instructions to the GPU via a graphics API (Vulkan, OpenGL, "
"OpenGL ES or WebGL). The communication and driver activity involved can be "
"quite costly, especially in OpenGL, OpenGL ES and WebGL. If we can provide "
"these instructions in a way that is preferred by the driver and GPU, we can "
"greatly increase performance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Nearly every API command in OpenGL requires a certain amount of validation "
"to make sure the GPU is in the correct state. Even seemingly simple commands "
"can lead to a flurry of behind-the-scenes housekeeping. Therefore, the goal "
"is to reduce these instructions to a bare minimum and group together similar "
"objects as much as possible so they can be rendered together, or with the "
"minimum number of these expensive state changes."

msgid "2D batching"
msgstr "検索"

msgid ""
"In 2D, the costs of treating each item individually can be prohibitively "
"high - there can easily be thousands of them on the screen. This is why 2D "
"*batching* is used with OpenGL-based rendering methods. Multiple similar "
"items are grouped together and rendered in a batch, via a single draw call, "
"rather than making a separate draw call for each item. In addition, this "
"means state changes, material and texture changes can be kept to a minimum."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Vulkan-based rendering methods do not use 2D batching yet. Since draw calls "
"are much cheaper with Vulkan compared to OpenGL, there is less of a need to "
"have 2D batching (although it can still be beneficial in some cases)."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "3D batching"
msgstr "検索"

msgid ""
"In 3D, we still aim to minimize draw calls and state changes. However, it "
"can be more difficult to batch together several objects into a single draw "
"call. 3D meshes tend to comprise hundreds or thousands of triangles, and "
"combining large meshes in real-time is prohibitively expensive. The costs of "
"joining them quickly exceeds any benefits as the number of triangles grows "
"per mesh. A much better alternative is to **join meshes ahead of time** "
"(static meshes in relation to each other). This can be done by artists, or "
"programmatically within Godot using an add-on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is also a cost to batching together objects in 3D. Several objects "
"rendered as one cannot be individually culled. An entire city that is off-"
"screen will still be rendered if it is joined to a single blade of grass "
"that is on screen. Thus, you should always take objects' location and "
"culling into account when attempting to batch 3D objects together. Despite "
"this, the benefits of joining static objects often outweigh other "
"considerations, especially for large numbers of distant or low-poly objects."

"to minimize GPU state changes as much as possible. :ref:`StandardMaterial3D "

"**Reusing Materials:** The fewer different materials in the scene, the "

"Nowadays, all this is handled inside the GPU, greatly increasing "

"performance because 3D modeling software (such as Blender, 3ds Max, etc.) "
"need to keep geometry in CPU memory for it to be edited, reducing actual "

"To be more efficient, mobile GPUs attempt to avoid *overdraw*. Overdraw "
"occurs when the same pixel on the screen is being rendered more than once. "
"Imagine a town with several buildings. GPUs don't know what is visible and "
"what is hidden until they draw it. For example, a house might be drawn and "
"then another house in front of it (which means rendering happened twice for "
"the same pixel). PC GPUs normally don't care much about this and just throw "

"Using more power is not an option on mobile so mobile devices use a "
"technique called *tile-based rendering* which divides the screen into a "
"grid. Each cell keeps the list of triangles drawn to it and sorts them by "
"depth to minimize *overdraw*. This technique improves performance and "
"reduces power consumption, but takes a toll on vertex performance. As a "

"Additionally, tile-based rendering struggles when there are small objects "
"with a lot of geometry within a small portion of the screen. This forces "
"mobile GPUs to put a lot of strain on a single screen tile, which "

"To summarize, don't worry about vertex count on mobile, but **avoid "

"In contrast to vertex processing, the costs of fragment (per-pixel) shading "

"increased: the area of a 4K screen is 8,294,400 pixels, versus 307,200 for "
"an old 640×480 VGA screen. That is 27 times the area! Also, the complexity "
"of fragment shaders has exploded. Physically-based rendering requires "
"complex calculations for each fragment."

"You can test whether a project is fill rate-limited quite easily. Turn off V-"
"Sync to prevent capping the frames per second, then compare the frames per "
"second when running with a large window, to running with a very small "
"window. You may also benefit from similarly reducing your shadow map size if "
"using shadows. Usually, you will find the FPS increases quite a bit using a "
"small window, which indicates you are to some extent fill rate-limited. On "
"the other hand, if there is little to no increase in FPS, then your "
"bottleneck lies elsewhere."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can increase performance in a fill rate-limited project by reducing the "
"amount of work the GPU has to do. You can do this by simplifying the shader "
"(perhaps turn off expensive options if you are using a :ref:"

msgid ""
"In 3D, the shapes of objects depend more on the geometry than the texture, "

"Transparent objects present particular problems for rendering efficiency. "

"Transparent objects are also particularly bad for fill rate, because every "
"item has to be drawn even if other transparent objects will be drawn on top "

"Opaque objects don't have to do this. They can usually take advantage of the "

"Transparency is particularly expensive where multiple transparent objects "
