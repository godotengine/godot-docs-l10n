"with the Godot Oculus Mobile plugin."
msgstr ""
"このチュートリアルでは、公式のGodotプラグインを使って*Oculus Quest*の開発を始"

"First you need to go through the steps on the :ref:"

"toolset that Godot needs to export to Android devices."
msgstr ""
"また、カスタムのエクスポート テンプレートを作成するときでも、チュートリアル"
"\\ :ref:`doc_exporting_for_android`\\ のステップを追う必要があります。"

msgid "To get started open Godot and create a new project."

"Make sure to choose the ``GLES2`` renderer. Due to the Quest's GPU this "
"backend is far better suited for the Quest."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Copy the addons folder from the Oculus Mobile asset into your Godot project. "
"Your project tree should look similar to this:"

msgid "Now you can start building the main scene:"

msgid "Add an :ref:`ARVROrigin <class_ARVROrigin>` node first."
msgstr "最初に :ref:`ARVROrigin <class_ARVROrigin>` ノードを追加します。"

"Assign controller ID 1 to the first :ref:`ARVRController "

msgid ""
"Assign controller ID 2 to the second :ref:`ARVRController "
"<class_ARVRController>` and rename that to ``RightHand``."

msgid ""
"Finally add a :ref:`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>` as a child node to "
"our first :ref:`ARVRController <class_ARVRController>` and create a box "
"shape, resize the box so each side is set to 0.1. Now duplicate the :ref:"
"`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>` and move it to the second :ref:"
"`ARVRController <class_ARVRController>` node. These will stand in for our "
"controllers."

"Before you can export this project to the Quest you need to do three more "
"things."
msgstr ""
"Androidへエクスポートできるようにするには、下記のソフトウェアをダウンロードす"
"る必要があります。"

msgid ""
"First go into the project settings and make sure that the main scene is the "
"scene we run. Godot does not ask you to set this on export."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then go into the export menu and configure a new Android export. If you "
"still haven't gone through the :ref:`doc_exporting_for_android` page do it "
"now. If you didn't you'll have some red messages on this screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you did you can forge ahead and make a few small changes to the export "
"settings. First change the XR Mode to ``Oculus Mobile VR``. Then change the "
"Degrees of Freedom mode to ``6DOF``."
