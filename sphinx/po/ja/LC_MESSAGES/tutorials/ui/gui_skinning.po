msgid "Introduction to GUI skinning"
msgstr "CSGノードの入門"

msgid ""
"It is essential for a game to provide clear, informative, and yet visually "
"pleasing user interface to its players. While :ref:`Control <class_Control>` "
"nodes come with a decently functional look out of the box, there is always "
"room for uniqueness and case-specific tuning. For this purpose Godot engine "
"includes a system for GUI skinning (or theming), which allows you to "
"customize the look of every control in your user interface, including your "
"custom controls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is an example of this system in action — a game with the GUI that is "
"radically different from the default UI theme of the engine:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A \"Gear Up!\" screen in Tank Kings, courtesy of Winterpixel Games"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Beyond achieving a unique look for your game, this system also enables "
"developers to provide customization options to the end users, including "
"accessibility settings. UI themes are applied in a cascading manner (i.e. "
"they propagate from parent controls to their children), which means that "
"font settings or adjustments for colorblind users can be applied in a single "
"place and affect the entire UI tree. Of course this system can also be used "
"for gameplay purposes: your hero-based game can change its style for the "
"selected player character, or you can give different flavors to the sides in "
"your team-based project."

msgid "Basics of themes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The skinning system is driven by the :ref:`Theme <class_Theme>` resource. "
"Every Godot project has an inherent default theme that contains the settings "
"used by the built-in control nodes. This is what gives the controls their "
"distinct look out of the box. A theme only describes the configuration, "
"however, and it is still the job of each individual control to use that "
"configuration in the way it requires to display itself. This is important to "
"remember when implementing :ref:`your own custom controls "
"<doc_custom_gui_controls>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Even the Godot editor itself relies on the default theme. But it doesn't "
"look the same as a Godot project, because it applies its own heavily "
"customized theme on top of the default one. In principle, this works exactly "
"like it would in your game as explained :ref:`below "
"<doc_gui_theme_in_project>`."

msgid ""
"The configuration that is stored in a theme consists of theme items. Each "
"item has a unique name and must be one of the following data types:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Color**"
msgstr "\\ **Color**"

msgid ""
"A :ref:`color <class_Color>` value, which is often used for fonts and "
"backgrounds. Colors can also be used for modulation of controls and icons."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "**Constant**"
msgstr "定数"

msgid ""
"An integer value, which can be used either for numeric properties of "
"controls (such as the item separation in a :ref:`BoxContainer "
"<class_BoxContainer>`), or for boolean flags (such as the drawing of "
"relationship lines in a :ref:`Tree <class_Tree>`)."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "**Font**"
msgstr "**フォント**"

msgid ""
"A :ref:`font <class_Font>` resource, which is used by controls that display "
"text. Fonts contain most text rendering settings, except for its size and "
"color. On top of that, alignment and text direction are controlled by "
"individual controls."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Icon**"

msgid "**StyleBox**"
msgstr "**様式**"

msgid ""
"A :ref:`StyleBox <class_StyleBox>` resource, a collection of configuration "
"options which define the way a UI panel should be displayed. This is not "
"limited to the :ref:`Panel <class_Panel>` control, as styleboxes are used by "
"many controls for their backgrounds and overlays."

msgid "Theme types"
msgstr "名前付き型"

msgid ""
"To help with the organization of its items each theme is separated into "
"types, and each item must belong to a single type. In other words, each "
"theme item is defined by its name, its data type and its theme type. This "
"combination must be unique within the theme. For example, there cannot be "
"two color items named ``font_color`` in a type called ``Label``, but there "
"can be another ``font_color`` item in a type ``LineEdit``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default Godot theme comes with multiple theme types already defined, one "
"for every built-in control node that uses UI skinning. The example above "
"contains actual theme items present in the default theme. You can refer to "
"the **Theme Properties** section in the class reference for each control to "
"see which items are available to it and its child classes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Child classes can use theme items defined for their parent class (``Button`` "
"and its derivatives being a good example of that). In fact, every control "
"can use every theme item of any theme type, if it needs to (but for the "
"clarity and predictability we try to avoid that in the engine)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is important to remember that for child classes that process is "
"automated. Whenever a built-in control requests a theme item from the theme "
"it can omit the theme type, and its class name will be used instead. On top "
"of that, the class names of its parent classes will also be used in turn. "
"This allows changes to the parent class, such as ``Button``, to affect all "
"derived classes without the need to customize every one of them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also define your own theme types, and additionally customize both "
"built-in controls and your own controls. Because built-in controls have no "
"knowledge of your custom theme types, you must utilize scripts to access "
"those items. All control nodes have several methods that allow to fetch "
"theme items from the theme that is applied to them. Those methods accept the "
"theme type as one of the arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To give more customization opportunities types can also be linked together "
"as type variations. This is another use-case for custom theme types. For "
"example, a theme can contain a type ``Header`` which can be marked as a "
"variation of the base ``Label`` type. An individual ``Label`` control can "
"then be set to use the ``Header`` variation for its type, and every time a "
"theme item is requested from a theme this variation will be used before any "
"other type. This allows to store various presets of theme items for the same "
"class of the control node in the single ``Theme`` resource."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only variations available from the default theme or defined in the custom "
"project theme are shown in the Inspector dock as options. You can still "
"input manually the name of a variation that is defined outside of those two "
"places, but it is recommended to keep all variations to the project theme."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can learn more about creating and using theme type variations in a :ref:"
"`dedicated article <doc_gui_theme_type_variations>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customizing a control"
msgstr "コントロールのカスタマイズ"

msgid ""
"Each control node can be customized directly without the use of themes. This "
"is called local overrides. Every theme property from the control's class "
"reference can be overridden directly on the control itself, using either the "
"Inspector dock, or scripts. This allows to make granular changes to a "
"particular part of the UI, while not affecting anything else in the project, "
"including this control's children."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Local overrides are less useful for the visual flair of your user interface, "
"especially if you aim for consistency. However, for layout nodes these are "
"essential. Nodes such as :ref:`BoxContainer <class_BoxContainer>` and :ref:"
"`GridContainer <class_GridContainer>` use theme constants for defining "
"separation between their children, and :ref:`MarginContainer "
"<class_MarginContainer>` stores its customizable margins in its theme items."

msgid ""
"Whenever a control has a local theme item override, this is the value that "
"it uses. Values provided by the theme are ignored."

msgid "Customizing a project"
msgstr "プロジェクトの作成"

msgid ""
"Out of the box each project adopts the default project theme provided by "
"Godot. The default theme itself is constant and cannot be changed, but its "
"items can be overridden with a custom theme. Custom themes can be applied in "
"two ways: as a project setting, and as a node property throughout the tree "
"of control nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two project settings that can be adjusted to affect your entire "
"project: :ref:`gui/theme/custom<class_ProjectSettings_property_gui/theme/"
"custom>` allows you to set a custom project-wide theme, and :ref:`gui/theme/"
"custom_font<class_ProjectSettings_property_gui/theme/custom_font>` does the "
"same to the default fallback font. When a theme item is requested by a "
"control node the custom project theme, if present, is checked first. Only if "
"it doesn't have the item the default theme is checked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This allows you to configure the default look of every Godot control with a "
"single theme resource, but you can go more granular than that. Every control "
"node also has a :ref:`theme <class_Control_property_theme>` property, which "
"allows you to set a custom theme for the branch of nodes starting with that "
"control. This means that the control and all of its children, and their "
"children in turn, would first check that custom theme resource before "
"falling back on the project and the default themes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of changing the project setting you can set the custom theme "
"resource to the root-most control node of your entire UI branch to almost "
"the same effect. While in the running project it will behave as expected, "
"individual scenes will still display using the default theme when previewing "
"or running them directly. To fix that you can set the same theme resource to "
"the root control of each individual scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, you can have a certain style for buttons in your project theme, "
"but want a different look for buttons inside of a popup dialog. You can set "
"a custom theme resource to the root control of your popup and define a "
"different style for buttons within that resource. As long as the chain of "
"control nodes between the root of the popup and the buttons is "
"uninterrupted, those buttons will use the styles defined in the theme "
"resource that is closest to them. All other controls will still be styled "
"using the project-wide theme and the default theme styles."

"To sum it up, for an arbitrary control its theme item lookup would look "

msgid "Beyond controls"
msgstr "構文制御"

msgid ""
"Naturally, themes are an ideal type of resource for storing configuration "
"for something visual. While the support for theming is built into control "
"nodes, other nodes can use them as well, just like any other resource."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An example of using themes for something beyond controls can be a modulation "
"of sprites for the same units on different teams in a strategy game. A theme "
"resource can define a collection of colors, and sprites (with a help from "
"scripts) can use those colors to draw the texture. The main benefit being "
"that you could make different themes using the same theme items for red, "
"blue, and green teams, and swap them with a single resource change."
