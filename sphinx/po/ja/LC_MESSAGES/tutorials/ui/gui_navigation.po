msgid "Keyboard/Controller Navigation and Focus"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is a common requirement for a user interface to have full keyboard and "
"controller support for navigation and interaction. There are two main "
"reasons why this is beneficial for projects: improved accessibility (not "
"everyone can use mouse or touch controls for interactions), and getting your "
"project ready for :ref:`consoles <doc_consoles>` (or just for people who "
"prefer to game with a controller on PC)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigating between UI elements with keyboard or controller is done by "
"changing which node is actively selected. This is also called changing UI "
"focus. Every :ref:`Control <class_Control>` node in Godot is capable of "
"having focus. By default, some control nodes have the ability to "
"automatically grab focus reacting to built-in UI actions such as ``ui_up``, "
"``ui_down``, ``ui_focus_next``, etc. These actions can be seen in the "
"project settings in the input map and can be modified."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because these actions are used for focus they should not be used for any "
"gameplay code."

msgid "Node settings"
msgstr "ユーザー設定"

msgid ""
"In addition to the built-in logic, you can define what is known as focus "
"neighbors for each individual control node. This allows to finely tune the "
"path the UI focus takes across the user interface of your project. The "
"settings for individual nodes can be found in the Inspector dock, under the "
"\"Focus\" category of the \"Control\" section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Neighbor options are used to define nodes for 4-directional navigation, such "
"as using arrow keys or a D-pad on a controller. For example, the bottom "
"neighbor will be used when navigating down with the down arrow or by pushing "
"down on the D-pad. The \"Next\" and \"Previous\" options are used with the "
"focus shift button, such as :kbd:`Tab` on desktop operating systems."
msgstr ""

msgid "A node can lose focus if it becomes hidden."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The mode setting defines how a node can be focused. **All** means a node can "
"be focused by clicking on it with the mouse, or selecting it with a keyboard "
"or controller. **Click** means it can only be focused on by clicking on it. "
"Finally, **None** means it can't be focused at all. Different control nodes "
"have different default settings for this based on how they are typically "
"used, for example, :ref:`Label <class_Label>` nodes are set to \"None\" by "
"default, while :ref:`buttons <class_Button>` are set to \"All\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure to properly configure your scenes for focus and navigation. If a "
"node has no focus neighbor configured, the engine will try to guess the next "
"control automatically. This may result in unintended behavior, especially in "
"a complex user interface that doesn't have well-defined vertical or "
"horizontal navigation flow."
msgstr ""

msgid "Necessary code"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For keyboard and controller navigation to work correctly, any node must be "
"focused on using code when the scene starts. Without doing this, pressing "
"buttons or keys won't do anything. Here is a basic example of setting "
"initial focus with code:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now when the scene starts the \"Start Button\" node will be focused, and the "
"keyboard or a controller can be used to navigate between it and other UI "
"elements."
