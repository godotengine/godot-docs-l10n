"This guide explains how to get nodes, create nodes, add them as a child, and "
"instantiate scenes from code."

msgid "Getting nodes"
msgstr "ノード作成"

msgid ""
"You can get a reference to a node by calling the :ref:`Node.get_node() "
"<class_Node_method_get_node>` method. For this to work, the child node must "
"be present in the scene tree. Getting it in the parent node's ``_ready()`` "
"function guarantees that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If, for example,  you have a scene tree like this, and you want to get a "
"reference to the Sprite and Camera2D nodes to access them in your script."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "To do so, you can use the following code."
msgstr "インターフェイスを有効にするには、次のコードを実行します:"

msgid ""
"Note that you get nodes using their name, not their type. Above, \"Sprite\" "
"and \"Camera2D\" are the nodes' names in the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you rename the Sprite node as Skin in the Scene dock, you have to change "
"the line that gets the node to ``get_node(\"Skin\")`` in the script."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Node paths"
msgstr "\\ node path"

msgid ""
"When getting a reference to a node, you're not limited to getting a direct "
"child. The ``get_node()`` function supports paths, a bit like when working "
"with a file browser. Add a slash to separate nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Take the following example scene, with the script attached to the "
"UserInterface node."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "To get the Tween node, you would use the following code."
msgstr "インターフェイスを有効にするには、次のコードを実行します:"

msgid ""
"As with file paths, you can use \"..\" to get a parent node. The best "
"practice is to avoid doing that though not to break encapsulation. You can "
"also start the path with a forward slash to make it absolute, in which case "
"your topmost node would be \"/root\", the application's predefined root "
"viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid "Syntactic sugar"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use two shorthands to shorten your code in GDScript. Firstly, "
"putting the ``onready`` keyword before a member variable makes it initialize "
"right before the ``_ready()`` callback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is also a short notation for ``get_node()``: the dollar sign, \"$\". "
"You place it before the name or path of the node you want to get."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating nodes"
msgstr "ノード作成"

msgid ""
"To create a node from code, call its ``new()`` method like for any other "
"class-based datatype."
msgstr ""
"コードからノードを作成するには、他のクラスベースのデータ型と同様に、\\ "
"``new()``\\ メソッドを呼び出します。"

msgid ""
"You can store the newly created node's reference in a variable and call "
"``add_child()`` to add it as a child of the node to which you attached the "
"script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To delete a node and free it from memory, you can call its ``queue_free()`` "
"method. Doing so queues the node for deletion at the end of the current "
"frame after it has finished processing. At that point, the engine removes "
"the node from the scene and frees the object in memory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before calling ``sprite.queue_free()``, the remote scene tree looks like "
"this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the engine freed the node, the remote scene tree doesn't display the "
"sprite anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can alternatively call ``free()`` to immediately destroy the node. You "
"should do this with care as any reference to it will instantly become "
"``null``. We recommend using ``queue_free()`` unless you know what you're "
"doing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you free a node, it also frees all its children. Thanks to this, to "
"delete an entire branch of the scene tree, you only have to free the topmost "
"parent node."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instancing scenes"
msgstr "シーンのインスタンス化"

msgid ""
"Scenes are templates from which you can create as many reproductions as "
"you'd like. This operation is called instancing, and doing it from code "
"happens in two steps:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Loading the scene from the hard drive."
msgstr "渡されたベースパスからエンジンをロードします。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Creating an instance of the loaded :ref:`PackedScene <class_PackedScene>` "
"resource."
msgstr ""
"シーンのインスタンスを得るには、\\ :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "
"<class_PackedScene_method_instance>`\\ メソッドを使う必要があります。"

msgid ""
"Preloading the scene can improve the user's experience as the load operation "
"happens when the compiler reads the script and not at runtime. This feature "
"is only available with GDScript."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"At that point, ``scene`` is a packed scene resource, not a node. To create "
"the actual node, you need to call :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "
"<class_PackedScene_method_instance>`. It returns a tree of nodes that you "
"can as a child of your current node."
msgstr ""
"しかし、 ``scene`` はまだノードではありません。\\ :ref:`PackedScene "
"<class_PackedScene>`\\ と呼ばれる特別なリソースにパックされています。実際の"
"ノードを作成するには、\\ :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "
"<class_PackedScene_method_instance>`\\ 関数を呼び出す必要があります。これによ"
"り、アクティブシーンに追加できるノードのツリーが返されます:"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The advantage of this two-step process is you can keep a packed scene loaded "
"and create new instances on the fly. For example, to quickly instance "
"several enemies or bullets."
msgstr ""
"この2段階のプロセスの利点は、パックされたシーンをロードして使用できる状態に保"
"ち、必要なだけインスタンスを作成できることです。 これは、アクティブシーン内の"
"複数の敵、弾丸、その他の存在をすばやくインスタンス化するのに特に便利です。"
