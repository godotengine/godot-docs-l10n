"Although occlusion culling greatly reduces the number of objects that need "
"to be rendered, there are other costs to maintaining objects in a game "
"besides the final rendering. For instance, in Godot, animated objects will "
"still be animated whether they appear on screen or not. This can take up a "
"lot of processing power, especially for objects that use software skinning "
"(where skinning is calculated on the CPU)."

"The gameplay area is not confined to just the objects you can see in front "

"there is any part of a room that can possibly be viewed from any part of the "
"room you are in (even from a corner), it is considered within the PVS, and "
