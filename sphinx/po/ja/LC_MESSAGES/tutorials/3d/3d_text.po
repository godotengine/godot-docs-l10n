"In a project, there may be times when text needs to be created as part of a "
"3D scene and not just in the HUD. Godot provides two methods to do this. The "
"Label3D node and the text mesh for a MeshInstance node."

"Label3D behaves like a label node but in a 3D space. Unlike label node this "
"can not inherit properties of a GUI theme. However its look remains "
"customizable and uses the same DynamicFont and BitmapFont subresources "
"control nodes use."

msgid ""
"Label3D has minimal interaction with a 3D environment, it can be lit up and "
"shaded by light sources if the shaded flag is enabled, but it will not cast "
"a shadow, even with cast shadow turned on under the nodes GeometryInstance3D "
"settings. This is because the node is a quad mesh (one glyph per quad) with "
"transparent textures and has the same limitations as Sprite3D. See :ref:"
"`this page <doc_3d_rendering_limitations_transparency_sorting>` for more "
"information."

msgid "Text mesh"
msgstr "次のステップ"

msgid ""
"Text meshes have similarities to Label3D. They display text in a 3D scene, "
"and will use the same DynamicFont subresource. However text is 3D and has "
"the properties of a mesh. A text mesh cast shadows onto the environment and "
"can have a material applied to it. Here is an example of a texture and how "
"it's applied to the mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two limitations to text mesh. It can't use bitmap fonts, or fonts "
"with self intersection."
