msgid "Console publishing process"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regardless of the engine used to create the game, the process to publish a "
"game to a console platform is as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Register a developer account on the console manufacturer's website, then "
"sign NDAs and publishing contracts. This requires you to have a registered "
"legal entity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. "
"This can take up to several months. Note that this step is significantly "
"easier if an established publisher is backing your game. Nintendo is "
"generally known to be more accepting of smaller developers, but this is not "
"guaranteed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Get access to developer tools and order a console specially made for "
"developers (*devkit*). The cost of those devkits is confidential."
msgstr ""

msgid "Port the engine to the console platform or pay a company to do it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To be published, your game needs to be rated in the regions you'd like to "
"sell it in. For example, in North America, the `ESRB <https://www.esrb.org/"
">`__ handles game ratings. In Europe, this is done by `PEGI <https://pegi."
"info/>`__. Indie developers can generally get a rating for cheaper compared "
"to more established developers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to the complexity of the process, the budget to publish a game by "
"yourself on a single console often exceeds $1,000 (this is a rough figure)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Official support"
msgstr "公式サポート"

msgid ""
"Godot supports the Linux-based Steam Deck. The reason other consoles are not "
"officially supported are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To develop for consoles, one must be licensed as a company. As an open "
"source project, Godot does not have such a legal figure."
msgstr ""
"コンソール用に開発するには、企業としてライセンスを取得する必要があります。"
"オープンソースプロジェクトとして、Godotにはそのような法的な体制はありません。"

msgid ""
"Console SDKs are secret and covered by non-disclosure agreements. Even if we "
"could get access to them, we could not publish the platform-specific code "
"under an open source license."
msgstr ""
"Console SDKは秘密であり、秘密保持契約の対象です。それらにアクセスできたとして"
"も、プラットフォーム固有のコードをオープンソースライセンスで公開することはで"
"きません。"

msgid ""
"Consoles require specialized hardware to develop for, so regular individuals "
"can't create games for them anyway."
msgstr ""
"コンソールには専用のハードウェアが必要であるため、通常のユーザーはゲーム用の"
"ゲームを作成できません。"

msgid ""
"However, it is still possible to port your games to consoles thanks to "
"services provided by third-party companies."
msgstr ""
"ただし、サードパーティ企業が提供するサービスのおかげで、ゲームをコンソールに"
"移植することは可能です。"

msgid ""
"In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine, except "
"that you need to contact a third-party developer to handle the porting "
"process. In other words, there is no engine that is legally allowed to "
"distribute console export templates without requiring the user to prove that "
"they are a licensed console developer. Doing so would violate the console "
"manufacturer's NDA."
msgstr ""

msgid "Third-party support"
msgstr "サードパーティのサポート"

msgid ""
"Console ports of Godot are offered by third-party companies (which have "
"ported Godot on their own). These companies also offer publishing of your "
"games to various consoles."
msgstr ""
"Godotのコンソールへの入り口は、サードパーティ企業(Godotを独自に移植している)"
"によって提供されています。これらの企業は、さまざまなコンソールへのゲームの公"
"開も提供しています。"
