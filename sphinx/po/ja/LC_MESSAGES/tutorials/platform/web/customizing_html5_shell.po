msgid "Custom HTML page for Web export"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While Web export templates provide a default HTML page fully capable of "
"launching the project without any further customization, it may be "
"beneficial to create a custom HTML page. While the game itself cannot easily "
"be directly controlled from the outside yet, such page allows to customize "
"the initialization process for the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some use-cases where customizing the default page is useful include:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Loading files from a different directory than the page;"
msgstr "ページとは別のディレクトリからファイルを読み込む;"

msgid "Loading a ``.zip`` file instead of a ``.pck`` file as the main pack;"
msgstr ""
"``.pck`` ファイルの代わりに ``.zip`` ファイルをメインパックとして読み込む;"

msgid "Loading the engine from a different directory than the main pack file;"
msgstr "メインパックファイルとは異なるディレクトリからエンジンを読み込む;"

msgid ""
"Adding a click-to-play button so that games can be started in the fullscreen "
"mode;"
msgstr ""
"「クリックでプレイ」ボタンを追加して、フルスクリーンモードでもゲームを開始で"
"きるようにする;"

msgid ""
"Loading some extra files before the engine starts, making them available in "
"the project file system as soon as possible;"
msgstr ""
"エンジンが起動する前に追加ファイルをロードして、それらをできるだけ即座にプロ"
"ジェクト ファイルシステム内で利用できるようにする;"

"Passing custom command line arguments, e.g. ``-s`` to start a ``MainLoop`` "
"script."

"The default HTML page is available in the Godot Engine repository at `/misc/"
"dist/html/full-size.html <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/"
"misc/dist/html/full-size.html>`__ but the following template can be used as "
"a much simpler example:"

msgstr "セットアップ"

msgid ""
"As shown by the example above, it is mostly a regular HTML document, with "
"few placeholders which needs to be replaced during export, an html "
"``<canvas>`` element, and some simple JavaScript code that calls the :js:"
"class:`Engine` class."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "The only required placeholders are:"
msgstr "複数のプレースホルダだけが:"

msgid ""
"``$GODOT_URL``: The name of the main JavaScript file, which provides the :js:"
"class:`Engine` class required to start the engine and that must be included "
"in the HTML as a ``<script>``. The name is generated from the *Export Path* "
"during the export process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``$GODOT_CONFIG``: A JavaScript object, containing the export options and "
"can be later overridden. See :js:attr:`EngineConfig` for the full list of "
"overrides."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following optional placeholders will enable some extra features in your "
"custom HTML template."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``$GODOT_PROJECT_NAME``: The project name as defined in the Project "
"Settings. It is a good idea to use it as a ``<title>`` in your template."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``$GODOT_HEAD_INCLUDE``: A custom string to include in the HTML document "
"just before the end of the ``<head>`` tag. It is customized in the export "
"options under the *Html / Head Include* section. While you fully control the "
"HTML page you create, this variable can be useful for configuring parts of "
"the HTML ``head`` element from the Godot Editor, e.g. for different Web "
"export presets."

msgid "Starting the project"
msgstr "プロジェクトの開始"

msgid ""
"To be able to start the game, you need to write a script that initializes "
"the engine — the control code. This process consists of three steps, but as "
"shown here, most of them can be skipped depending on how much customization "
"is needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the :ref:`HTML5 shell class reference <doc_html5_shell_classref>`, for "
"the full list of methods and options available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, the engine must be loaded, then it needs to be initialized, and after "
"this the project can finally be started. You can perform every of these "
"steps manually and with great control. However, in the simplest case all you "
"need to do is to create an instance of the :js:class:`Engine` class with the "
"exported configuration, and then call the :js:meth:`engine.startGame <Engine."
"prototype.startGame>` method optionally overriding any :js:attr:"
"`EngineConfig` parameters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This snippet of code automatically loads and initializes the engine before "
"starting the game. It uses the given configuration to load the engine. The :"
"js:meth:`engine.startGame <Engine.prototype.startGame>` method is "
"asynchronous and returns a ``Promise``. This allows your control code to "
"track if the game was loaded correctly without blocking execution or relying "
"on polling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In case your project needs to have special control over the start arguments "
"and dependency files, the :js:meth:`engine.start <Engine.prototype.start>` "
"method can be used instead. Note, that this method do not automatically "
"preload the ``pck`` file, so you will probably want to manually preload it "
"(and any other extra file) via the :js:meth:`engine.preloadFile <Engine."
"prototype.preloadFile>` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Optionally, you can also manually :js:meth:`engine.init <Engine.prototype."
"init>` to perform specific actions after the module initialization, but "
"before the engine starts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This process is a bit more complex, but gives you full control over the "
"engine startup process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To load the engine manually the :js:meth:`Engine.load` static method must be "
"called. As this method is static, multiple engine instances can be spawned "
"if the share the same ``wasm``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiple instances cannot be spawned by default, as the engine is "
"immediately unloaded after it is initialized. To prevent this from happening "
"see the :js:attr:`unloadAfterInit` override option. It is still possible to "
"unload the engine manually afterwards by calling the :js:meth:`Engine."
"unload` static method. Unloading the engine frees browser memory by "
"unloading files that are no longer needed once the instance is initialized."

msgid "Customizing the behavior"
msgstr "ビルドのカスタマイズ"

msgid ""
"In the Web environment several methods can be used to guarantee that the "
"game will work as intended."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you target a specific version of WebGL, or just want to check if WebGL is "
"available at all, you can call the :js:meth:`Engine.isWebGLAvailable` "
"method. It optionally takes an argument that allows to test for a specific "
"major version of WebGL."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As the real executable file does not exist in the Web environment, the "
"engine only stores a virtual filename formed from the base name of loaded "
"engine files. This value affects the output of the :ref:`OS."
"get_executable_path() <class_OS_method_get_executable_path>` method and "
"defines the name of the automatically started main pack. The :js:attr:"
"`executable` override option can be used to override this value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customizing the presentation"
msgstr "プレゼンテーションのカスタマイズ"

msgid ""
"Several configuration options can be used to further customize the look and "
"behavior of the game on your page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the first canvas element on the page is used for rendering. To "
"use a different canvas element the :js:attr:`canvas` override option can be "
"used. It requires a reference to the DOM element itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The way the engine resize the canvas can be configured via the :js:attr:"
"`canvasResizePolicy` override option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your game takes some time to load, it may be useful to display a custom "
"loading UI which tracks the progress. This can be achieved with the :js:attr:"
"`onProgress` callback option, which allows to set up a callback function "
"that will be called regularly as the engine loads new bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Be aware that in some cases ``total`` can be ``0``. This means that it "
"cannot be calculated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your game supports multiple languages, the :js:attr:`locale` override "
"option can be used to force a specific locale, provided you have a valid "
"language code string. It may be good to use server-side logic to determine "
"which languages a user may prefer. This way the language code can be taken "
"from the ``Accept-Language`` HTTP header, or determined by a GeoIP service."
msgstr ""

msgid "Debugging"
msgstr "デバッグ"

msgid ""
"To debug exported projects, it may be useful to read the standard output and "
"error streams generated by the engine. This is similar to the output shown "
"in the editor console window. By default, standard ``console.log`` and "
"``console.warn`` are used for the output and error streams respectively. "
"This behavior can be customized by setting your own functions to handle "
"messages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the :js:attr:`onPrint` override option to set a callback function for "
"the output stream, and the :js:attr:`onPrintError` override option to set a "
"callback function for the error stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When handling the engine output, keep in mind that it may not be desirable "
"to print it out in the finished product."
