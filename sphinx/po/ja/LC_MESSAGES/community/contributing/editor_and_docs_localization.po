"The actual string you are working on in the \"Translation\" panel. By "
"default, there should be the English source string and an edit box for your "
"language. If you are familiar with other languages, you can add them in your "
"user settings to give you more context for translation. Once you are done "
"editing the current string, press \"Save\" to confirm changes and move to "
"the next entry. Alternatively, use the \"Skip\" button to skip it. The "
"\"Needs editing\" checkbox means that the original string was updated, and "
"the translation therefore needs review to take those changes into account "
"(in PO jargon, these are so-called \"fuzzy\" strings). Such strings won't be "
"used in the translation until fixed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The bottom panel has various tools which can help with the translation "
"effort, such as context from nearby strings (usually from the same editor "

"other translators, machine translations, and a list of all other existing "
"translations for that string."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the top right, the glossary shows terms for which an entry has been added "

"\"node\" term in Godot, you can add it to the glossary to ensure that other "
"translators use the same convention."

msgid "Locating original content"
msgstr "コンテンツの作成"

msgid ""
"PO files are an ordered list of source strings (``msgid``) and their "
"translation (``msgstr``), and by default, Weblate will present the strings "
"in that order. It can therefore be useful to understand how the content is "
"organized in the PO files to help you locate the original content and use it "
"as a reference when translating."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is primordial to use the original context as reference when translating, "
"as many words have several possible translations depending on the context. "
"Using the wrong translation can actually be detrimental to the user and make "
"things harder to understand than if they stayed in English. Using the "
"context also makes the translation effort much easier and more enjoyable, as "
"you can see directly if the translation you wrote will make sense in context."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The editor interface's translation template is generated by parsing all the "
"C++ source code in **alphabetical order**, so all the strings defined in a "
"given file will be grouped together. For example, if the \"source string "
"location\" indicates ``editor/code_editor.cpp``, the current string (and the "
"nearby ones) is defined in the ``editor/code_editor.cpp`` code file, and is "
"thereby related to the code editors in Godot (GDScript, shaders)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The online documentation's translation template is generated from the source "
"RST files in the same order as seen in the **table of contents**, so for "
"example the first strings are from the front page of the documentation. The "
"recommended workflow is therefore to find a unique string corresponding to a "
"page that you want to translate, and then translate all the strings with the "
"same source string location while comparing with the online version of that "
"page in English. An example of source string location could be "
"``getting_started/step_by_step/nodes_and_scenes.rst`` for the page :ref:"
"`doc_nodes_and_scenes`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The class reference's translation template is generated from the source XML "
"files in **alphabetical order**, which is also the same as the order of the "
"table of contents for the online version. You can therefore locate the "
"source string corresponding to the brief description of a given class to "
"find the first string to translate and all other descriptions from that "
"class should be in the subsequent strings on Weblate. For example, the "
"descriptions for the :ref:`class_Node2D` class would have the source string "
"location ``doc/classes/Node2D.xml``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A handy tool to locate specific pages/classes is to use Weblate's advanced "
"search feature, and especially the \"Location strings\" query (which can "
"also be used with the ``location:`` token, e.g. ``location:nodes_and_scenes."
"rst``):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a given source string is used in multiple source locations, they will "
"all be concatenated into one. For example, the above ``location:"
"nodes_and_scenes.rst`` query would land first on the \"Introduction\" source "
"string which is used in dozens of pages, including some that come before "
"``nodes_and_scenes.rst`` in the template. Clicking the \"Next\" button then "
"brings us to the \"Scene and nodes\" title string displayed above. So it may "
"happen that a given paragraph or section title is not at the location you'd "
"expect it when reading the online version of a page."

msgid "Respecting the markup syntax"

msgid ""
"**C format specifiers** such as ``%s`` (a string) or ``%d`` (a number). "
"These specifiers are replaced by content at runtime, and should be preserved "
"and placed in your translation where necessary for it to be meaningful after "
"substitution. You may need to refer to the source string location to "
"understand what kind of content will be substituted if it's not clear from "
"the sentence. Example (``%s``  will be substituted with a file name or "
"path)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**C escape characters** such as ``\\n`` (line break) or ``\\t`` "
"(tabulation). In the Weblate editor, the ``\\n`` characters are replaced by "
"``↵`` (return) and ``\\t`` by ``↹``. Tabs are not used much, but you should "
"make sure to use line breaks in the same way as the original English string "
"(Weblate will issue a warning if you don't). Line breaks might sometimes be "
"used for vertical spacing, or manual wrapping of long lines which would "
"otherwise be too long especially in the editor translation). Example::"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the above example, ``[code]name[/code]``, ``[code]alpha[/code]``, and "

"``[codeblock]`` should not be translated, as ``ColorN`` is a function of the "
