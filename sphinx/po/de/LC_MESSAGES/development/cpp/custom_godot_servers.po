"Godot implements multi-threading as servers. Servers are daemons which "
"manages data, processes, and pushes the result. Servers implement the "
"mediator pattern which interprets resource ID and process data for the "
"engine and other modules. In addition, the server claims ownership for its "
"RID allocations."
