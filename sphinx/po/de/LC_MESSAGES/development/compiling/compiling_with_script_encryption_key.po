"The export dialog gives you the option to encrypt your scripts with a 256-"
"bit AES key when releasing your project. This will make sure your scripts "
"are not stored in plain text and can not easily be ripped by some script "

"Of course, the key needs to be stored in the binary, but if it's compiled, "

"For this to work, you need to build the export templates from source, with "

"This will **not** work if you use official, precompiled export templates. It "
