"In this hands-on video series, you will create your first water shaders in "
"2D and in 3D. If you're new to shaders, you should start 2D, because you "
"need some basic understanding of the shading language, vertex and fragment "
"shaders, to build upon. 3D adds quite a bit of complexity when it comes to "
"writing shader programs, as you will see in the third video."
