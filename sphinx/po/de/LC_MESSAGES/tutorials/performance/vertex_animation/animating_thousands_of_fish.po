"This tutorial explores a technique used in the game `ABZU <https://www."
"gdcvault.com/play/1024409/Creating-the-Art-of-ABZ>`_ for rendering and "
"animating thousands of fish using vertex animation and static mesh "
"instancing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot, this can be accomplished with a custom :ref:`Shader "
"<class_Shader>` and a :ref:`MultiMeshInstance <class_MultiMeshInstance>`. "
"Using the following technique you can render thousands of animated objects, "
"even on low end hardware."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We will start by animating one fish. Then, we will see how to extend that "
"animation to thousands of fish."
msgstr ""

msgid "Animating one Fish"
msgstr "Einen Fisch animieren"

msgid ""
"We will start with a single fish. Load your fish model into a :ref:"
"`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>` and add a new :ref:`ShaderMaterial "
"<class_ShaderMaterial>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is the fish we will be using for the example images, you can use any "
"fish model you like."

msgid ""
"Typically, you would use bones and a :ref:`Skeleton <class_Skeleton>` to "
"animate objects. However, bones are animated on the CPU and so you end "
"having to calculate thousands of operations every frame and it becomes "
"impossible to have thousands of objects. Using vertex animation in a vertex "
"shader, you avoid using bones and can instead calculate the full animation "
"in a few lines of code and completely on the GPU."
msgstr ""

msgid "The animation will be made of four key motions:"
msgstr "Die Animation wird aus vier Hauptbewegungen bestehen:"

msgid "A side to side motion"
msgstr "Eine Bewegung von Seite zu Seite"

msgid "A pivot motion around the center of the fish"
msgstr "Eine Schwenkbewegung um das Zentrum des Fisches"

msgid "A panning wave motion"
msgstr "Eine schwenkende Wellenbewegung"

msgid "A panning twist motion"
msgstr "Eine schwenkende Drehbewegung"

msgid ""
"All the code for the animation will be in the vertex shader with uniforms "
"controlling the amount of motion. We use uniforms to control the strength of "
"the motion so that you can tweak the animation in editor and see the results "
"in real time, without the shader having to recompile."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All the motions will be made using cosine waves applied to ``VERTEX`` in "
"model space. We want the vertices to be in model space so that the motion is "
"always relative to the orientation of the fish. For example, side-to-side "
"will always move the fish back and forth in its left to right direction, "
"instead of on the ``x`` axis in the world orientation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to control the speed of the animation, we will start by defining "
"our own time variable using ``TIME``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first motion we will implement is the side to side motion. It can be "
"made by offsetting ``VERTEX.x`` by ``cos`` of ``TIME``. Each time the mesh "
"is rendered, all the vertices will move to the side by the amount of "
"``cos(time)``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The resulting animation should look something like this:"
msgstr "Die resultierende Animation sollte in etwa so aussehen:"

msgid ""
"Next, we add the pivot. Because the fish is centered at (0, 0), all we have "
"to do is multiply ``VERTEX`` by a rotation matrix for it to rotate around "
"the center of the fish."
msgstr ""

msgid "We construct a rotation matrix like so:"
msgstr "Wir konstruieren eine Rotationsmatrix wie folgt:"

msgid ""
"And then we apply it in the ``x`` and ``z`` axes by multiplying it by "
"``VERTEX.xz``."
msgstr ""

msgid "With only the pivot applied you should see something like this:"
msgstr "Mit dem Pivot als weiteres Element sollte es nun so aussehen:"

msgid ""
"The next two motions need to pan down the spine of the fish. For that, we "
"need a new variable, ``body``. ``body`` is a float that is ``0`` at the tail "
"of the fish and ``1`` at its head."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The next motion is a cosine wave that moves down the length of the fish. To "
"make it move along the spine of the fish, we offset the input to ``cos`` by "
"the position along the spine, which is the variable we defined above, "
"``body``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This looks very similar to the side to side motion we defined above, but in "
"this one, by using ``body`` to offset ``cos`` each vertex along the spine "
"has a different position in the wave making it look like a wave is moving "
"along the fish."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last motion is the twist, which is a panning roll along the spine. "
"Similarly to the pivot, we first construct a rotation matrix."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We apply the rotation in the ``xy`` axes so that the fish appears to roll "
"around its spine. For this to work, the fish's spine needs to be centered on "
"the ``z`` axis."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is the fish with twist applied:"
msgstr "Hier ist der Fisch mit angewandtem Twist:"

msgid ""
"If we apply all these motions one after another, we get a fluid jelly-like "
"motion."
msgstr ""
"Wenn wir alle diese Bewegungen nacheinander anwenden, erhalten wir eine "
"flüssige geleeartige Bewegung."

msgid ""
"Normal fish swim mostly with the back half of their body. Accordingly, we "
"need to limit the panning motions to the back half of the fish. To do this, "
"we create a new variable, ``mask``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``mask`` is a float that goes from ``0`` at the front of the fish to ``1`` "
"at the end using ``smoothstep`` to control the point at which the transition "
"from ``0`` to ``1`` happens."
msgstr ""

msgid "Below is an image of the fish with ``mask`` used as ``COLOR``:"
msgstr ""
"Unten ist ein Bild des Fisches mit einer ``Maske``, die als ``COLOR`` "
"verwendet wird:"

msgid ""
"For the wave, we multiply the motion by ``mask`` which will limit it to the "
"back half."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to apply the mask to the twist, we use ``mix``. ``mix`` allows us "
"to mix the vertex position between a fully rotated vertex and one that is "
"not rotated. We need to use ``mix`` instead of multiplying ``mask`` by the "
"rotated ``VERTEX`` because we are not adding the motion to the ``VERTEX`` we "
"are replacing the ``VERTEX`` with the rotated version. If we multiplied that "
"by ``mask``, we would shrink the fish."
msgstr ""

msgid "Putting the four motions together gives us the final animation."
msgstr ""
"Wenn wir die vier Bewegungen zusammenfügen, erhalten wir die endgültige "
"Animation."

msgid ""
"Go ahead and play with the uniforms in order to alter the swim cycle of the "
"fish. You will find that you can create a wide variety of swim styles using "
"these four motions."

msgid ""
"Godot makes it easy to render thousands of the same object using a "
"MultiMeshInstance node."
msgstr ""
"Godot erleichtert es, Tausende von Objekten mit Hilfe eines "
"MultiMeshInstance-Nodes darzustellen."

msgid ""
"A MultiMeshInstance node is created and used the same way you would make a "
"MeshInstance node. For this tutorial, we will name the MultiMeshInstance "
"node ``School``, because it will contain a school of fish."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you have a MultiMeshInstance add a :ref:`MultiMesh <class_MultiMesh>`, "
"and to that MultiMesh add your :ref:`Mesh <class_Mesh>` with the shader from "
"above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"MultiMeshes draw your Mesh with three additional per-instance properties: "
"Transform (rotation, translation, scale), Color, and Custom. Custom is used "
"to pass in 4 multi-use variables using a :ref:`Color <class_Color>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``instance_count`` specifies how many instances of the mesh you want to "
"draw. For now, leave ``instance_count`` at ``0`` because you cannot change "
"any of the other parameters while ``instance_count`` is larger than ``0``. "
"We will set ``instance count`` in GDScript later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``transform_format`` specifies whether the transforms used are 3D or 2D. For "
"this tutorial, select 3D."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For both ``color_format`` and ``custom_data_format`` you can choose between "
"``None``, ``Byte``, and ``Float``. ``None`` means you won't be passing in "
"that data (either a per-instance ``COLOR`` variable, or ``INSTANCE_CUSTOM``) "
"to the shader. ``Byte`` means each number making up the color you pass in "
"will be stored with 8 bits while ``Float`` means each number will be stored "
"in a floating-point number (32 bits). ``Float`` is slower but more precise, "
"``Byte`` will take less memory and be faster, but you may see some visual "
"artifacts."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, set ``instance_count`` to the number of fish you want to have."
msgstr ""
"Setzen Sie nun ``instance_count`` auf die Anzahl der Fische, die Sie haben "
"möchten."

msgid "Next we need to set the per-instance transforms."
msgstr "Als Nächstes müssen wir die Transformationen pro Instanz festlegen."

msgid ""
"There are two ways to set per-instance transforms for MultiMeshes. The first "
"is entirely in editor and is described in the :ref:`MultiMeshInstance "
"tutorial <doc_using_multi_mesh_instance>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second is to loop over all the instances and set their transforms in "
"code. Below, we use GDScript to loop over all the instances and set their "
"transform to a random position."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Running this script will place the fish in random positions in a box around "
"the position of the MultiMeshInstance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If performance is an issue for you, try running the scene with GLES2 or with "
"fewer fish."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice how all the fish are all in the same position in their swim cycle? It "
"makes them look very robotic. The next step is to give each fish a different "
"position in the swim cycle so the entire school looks more organic."
msgstr ""

msgid "Animating a school of fish"
msgstr "Animieren eines Fischschwarmes"

msgid ""
"One of the benefits of animating the fish using ``cos`` functions is that "
"they are animated with one parameter, ``time``. In order to give each fish a "
"unique position in the swim cycle, we only need to offset ``time``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We do that by adding the per-instance custom value ``INSTANCE_CUSTOM`` to "
"``time``."
msgstr ""
"Dazu fügen wir den benutzerdefinierten Wert ``INSTANCE_CUSTOM`` pro Instanz "
"zu ``time`` hinzu."

msgid ""
"Next, we need to pass a value into ``INSTANCE_CUSTOM``. We do that by adding "
"one line into the ``for`` loop from above. In the ``for`` loop we assign "
"each instance a set of four random floats to use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now the fish all have unique positions in the swim cycle. You can give them "
"a little more individuality by using ``INSTANCE_CUSTOM`` to make them swim "
"faster or slower by multiplying by ``TIME``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can even experiment with changing the per-instance color the same way "
"you changed the per-instance custom value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One problem that you will run into at this point is that the fish are "
"animated, but they are not moving. You can move them by updating the per-"
"instance transform for each fish every frame. Although doing so will be "
"faster than moving thousands of MeshInstances per frame, it'll still likely "
"be slow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the next tutorial we will cover how to use :ref:`Particles "
"<class_Particles>` to take advantage of the GPU and move each fish around "
"individually while still receiving the benefits of instancing."
