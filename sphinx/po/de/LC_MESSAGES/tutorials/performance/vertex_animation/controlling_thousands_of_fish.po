msgid ""
"The problem with :ref:`MeshInstances <class_MeshInstance>` is that it is "
"expensive to update their transform array. It is great for placing many "
"static objects around the scene. But it is still difficult to move the "
"objects around the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make each instance move in an interesting way, we will use a :ref:"
"`Particles <class_Particles>` node. Particles take advantage of GPU "
"acceleration by computing and setting the per-instance information in a :ref:"
"`Shader <class_Shader>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Particles are not available in GLES2, instead use :ref:`CPUParticles "
"<class_CPUParticles>`, which do the same thing as Particles, but do not "
"benefit from GPU acceleration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First create a Particles node. Then, under \"Draw Passes\" set the "
"Particle's \"Draw Pass 1\" to your :ref:`Mesh <class_Mesh>`. Then under "
"\"Process Material\" create a new :ref:`ShaderMaterial "
"<class_ShaderMaterial>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the ``shader_type`` to ``particles``."
msgstr "Setzen Sie den ``shader_type`` auf ``particles``."

msgid "Then add the following two functions:"
msgstr "Anschließend fügen Sie die folgenden beiden Funktionen hinzu:"

msgid ""
"These functions come from the default :ref:`ParticlesMaterial "
"<class_ParticlesMaterial>`. They are used to generate a random number from "
"each particle's ``RANDOM_SEED``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A unique thing about particle shaders is that some built-in variables are "
"saved across frames. ``TRANSFORM``, ``COLOR``, and ``CUSTOM`` can all be "
"accessed in the Spatial shader of the mesh, and also in the particle shader "
"the next time it is run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, setup your ``vertex`` function. Particles shaders only contain a "
"vertex function and no others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First we will distinguish between code that needs to be run only when the "
"particle system starts and code that should always run. We want to give each "
"fish a random position and a random animation offset when the system is "
"first run. To do so, we wrap that code in an ``if`` statement that checks "
"the built-in variable ``RESTART`` which becomes ``true`` for one frame when "
"the particle system is restarted."
msgstr ""

msgid "From a high level, this looks like:"
msgstr "Von einer höheren Ebene aus betrachtet sieht dies so aus:"

msgid ""
"Next, we need to generate 4 random numbers: 3 to create a random position "
"and one for the random offset of the swim cycle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, generate 4 seeds inside the ``RESTART`` block using the ``hash`` "
"function provided above:"
msgstr ""
"Generieren Sie zunächst 4 Startwerte innerhalb des ``RESTART``-Blocks mit "
"der oben angegebenen ``hash``-Funktion:"

msgid ""
"Then, use those seeds to generate random numbers using ``rand_from_seed``:"
msgstr ""
"Dann verwenden Sie diese Startwerte, um Zufallszahlen unter Verwendung von "
"``rand_from_seed`` zu erzeugen:"

msgid ""
"Finally, assign ``position`` to ``TRANSFORM[3].xyz``, which is the part of "
"the transform that holds the position information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remember, all this code so far goes inside the ``RESTART`` block."
msgstr ""
"Denken Sie daran, dass sich der gesamte Code bisher im Block ``RESTART`` "
"befindet."

msgid ""
"The vertex shader for your mesh can stay the exact same as it was in the "
"previous tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you can move each fish individually each frame, either by adding to the "
"``TRANSFORM`` directly or by writing to ``VELOCITY``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's transform the fish by setting their ``VELOCITY``."
msgstr ""
"Lassen Sie uns die Fische transformieren, indem wir ihre ``VELOCITY`` "
"einstellen."

msgid ""
"This is the most basic way to set ``VELOCITY`` every particle (or fish) will "
"have the same velocity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Just by setting ``VELOCITY`` you can make the fish swim however you want. "
"For example, try the code below."
msgstr ""

msgid "This will give each fish a unique speed between ``2`` and ``10``."
msgstr ""
"Dadurch erhält jeder Fisch eine einzigartige Geschwindigkeit zwischen ``2`` "
"und ``10``."

msgid ""
"If you used ``CUSTOM.y`` in the last tutorial, you can also set the speed of "
"the swim animation based on the ``VELOCITY``. Just use ``CUSTOM.y``."
msgstr ""

msgid "This code gives you the following behavior:"
msgstr "Dieser Code führt zu folgendem Ergebnis:"

msgid ""
"Using a ParticlesMaterial you can make the fish behavior as simple or "
"complex as you like. In this tutorial we only set Velocity, but in your own "
"Shaders you can also set ``COLOR``, rotation, scale (through ``TRANSFORM``). "
"Please refer to the :ref:`Particles Shader Reference <doc_particle_shader>` "
"for more information on particle shaders."
