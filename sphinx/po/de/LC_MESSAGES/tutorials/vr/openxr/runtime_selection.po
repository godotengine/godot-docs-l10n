msgid ""
"In OpenXR, it is standard for each runtime to implement a mechanism to make "
"it the current runtime. In Steam, the Oculus application or Windows MR "
"portal, there will be an option to switch to their runtime as the current "
"OpenXR runtime."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generally speaking, end users will have a preferred runtime due to not "
"having a reason to switch runtimes when playing games that support OpenXR. "
"However, developers may wish to test multiple runtimes to see if their game "
"behaves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make this easy, Godot provides a dropdown in the top-right corner which "
"can switch the runtime Godot will use when testing:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The OpenXR plugin will **not** work with the Microsoft MR runtime. That "
"runtime only supports OpenXR applications that use DirectX, but Godot uses "
"OpenGL ES 3.0 or 2.0."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Selecting a runtime in this dropdown only applies to running the game from "
"the editor. It does **not** change the runtime used by other applications. "
"Exported projects will use the computers current runtime. Also, if you are "
"deploying to an external device, this setting has no effect."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As OpenXR doesn't have a mechanism for registering runtimes that we can "
"query, Godot will check common locations for runtime configuration files. "
"The locations that are checked are stored in the ``addons/godot_openxr/"
"runtimes.json`` file. If you've installed a runtime in a nonstandard "
"location or a runtime not currently present in this file, you can add it "
"manually using a text editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the dropdown isn't shown in your editor, make sure the plugin is enabled. "
"See :ref:`doc_enable_plugin`."
