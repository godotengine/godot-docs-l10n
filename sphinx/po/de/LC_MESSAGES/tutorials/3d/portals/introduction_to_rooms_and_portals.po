msgid "Introduction to Rooms and Portals"
msgstr "Einführung in den Godot-Editor"

msgid ""
"The rooms and portals system is an optional component of Godot that allows "
"you to partition your 3D game levels into a series of :ref:"
"`Room<class_Room>` s (*aka cells*), and :ref:`Portal<class_Portal>` s. "
"Portals are openings between the rooms that the :ref:`Camera<class_Camera>` "
"(and lights) can see through."

msgid "This allows several features:"
msgstr "Dieser Ansatz hat diverse Vorteile:"

msgid ""
"**Portal occlusion culling**, which can increase performance by reducing the "
"number of objects that are drawn, both to cameras and to shadow maps."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Gameplay callbacks**, which allow turning off activity outside the "
"gameplay area - AI, physics, animation, processing etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The trade off for these features is that we have to manually partition our "
"level into rooms, and add portals between them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot portals should not be confused with those in the `game of the same "
"name <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)>`__. They do not "
"warp space, they simply represent a window that the camera (or lights) can "
"see through."

msgid ""
"Although the effort involved in creating rooms for a large level may seem "
"daunting, there are several factors which can make this much easier:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are \"kit bashing\" and reusing rooms or areas already, this is an "
"ideal way to save effort. Your level tiles can be rooms, with portals "
"already placed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are creating procedural levels, you can create rooms and portals as "
"part of the procedural generation algorithm you're writing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, if you are manually creating freeform levels, bear in mind there "
"are absolutely no rules as to how far you go with portalling. Even if you "
"separate a large game level into only two rooms, with a single portal "
"between them, this can still result in relatively large performance gains."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The performance benefits (especially in terms of occlusion) follow an L-"
"shaped curve, with the lion's share occurring when you have created just a "
"few rooms. So do not be afraid to be lazy - **\\*work smart\\***."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, when it comes to medium and large-sized levels, it is better to "
"do a little portalling than none at all."

msgid "Some caveats"
msgstr "Leistungseinschränkungen"

msgid ""
"The portal system should be considered an **advanced feature** of Godot. You "
"should not attempt to use rooms and portals until you are familiar with the "
"Godot editor, and have successfully made at least a couple of test games."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It gives you great power as a game designer, but the trade off is that it "
"requires a very technical approach to level design. It is aimed at producing "
"professional-grade results, and assumes the user is prepared to put in the "
"work for this. It is not intended to be used for all 3D games. Not all games "
"will significantly benefit from portals, and it may require more time than a "
"short game jam allows."
