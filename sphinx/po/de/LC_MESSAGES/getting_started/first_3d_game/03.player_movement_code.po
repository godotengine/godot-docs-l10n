"Let's start with the class's properties. We're going to define a movement "
"speed, a fall acceleration representing gravity, and a velocity we'll use to "
"move the character."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These are common properties for a moving body. The ``velocity`` is a 3D "
"vector combining a speed with a direction. Here, we define it as a property "
"because we want to update and reuse its value across frames."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The values are quite different from 2D code because distances are in meters. "
"While in 2D, a thousand units (pixels) may only correspond to half of your "
"screen's width, in 3D, it's a kilometer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's code the movement now. We start by calculating the input direction "
"vector using the global ``Input`` object, in ``_physics_process()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here, we're going to make all calculations using the ``_physics_process()`` "
"virtual function. Like ``_process()``, it allows you to update the node "
"every frame, but it's designed specifically for physics-related code like "
"moving a kinematic or rigid body."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To learn more about the difference between ``_process()`` and "
"``_physics_process()``, see :ref:`doc_idle_and_physics_processing`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We start by initializing a ``direction`` variable to ``Vector3.ZERO``. Then, "
"we check if the player is pressing one or more of the ``move_*`` inputs and "
"update the vector's ``x`` and ``z`` components accordingly. These correspond "
"to the ground plane's axes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These four conditions give us eight possibilities and eight possible "
"directions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In case the player presses, say, both W and D simultaneously, the vector "
"will have a length of about ``1.4``. But if they press a single key, it will "
"have a length of ``1``. We want the vector's length to be consistent. To do "
"so, we can call its ``normalize()`` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here, we only normalize the vector if the direction has a length greater "
"than zero, which means the player is pressing a direction key."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case, we also get the *Pivot* node and call its ``look_at()`` "
"method. This method takes a position in space to look at in global "
"coordinates and the up direction. In this case, we can use the ``Vector3."
"UP`` constant."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A node's local coordinates, like ``translation``, are relative to their "
"parent. Global coordinates are relative to the world's main axes you can see "
"in the viewport instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In 3D, the property that contains a node's position is ``translation``. By "
"adding the ``direction`` to it, we get a position to look at that's one "
"meter away from the *Player*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, we update the velocity. We have to calculate the ground velocity and "
"the fall speed separately. Be sure to go back one tab so the lines are "
"inside the ``_physics_process()`` function but outside the condition we just "
"wrote."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the vertical velocity, we subtract the fall acceleration multiplied by "
"the delta time every frame. Notice the use of the ``-=`` operator, which is "
"a shorthand for ``variable = variable - ...``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This line of code will cause our character to fall in every frame. This may "
"seem strange if it's already on the floor. But we have to do this for the "
"character to collide with the ground every frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The physics engine can only detect interactions with walls, the floor, or "
"other bodies during a given frame if movement and collisions happen. We will "
"use this property later to code the jump."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the last line, we call ``KinematicBody.move_and_slide()``. It's a "
"powerful method of the ``KinematicBody`` class that allows you to move a "
"character smoothly. If it hits a wall midway through a motion, the engine "
"will try to smooth it out for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function takes two parameters: our velocity and the up direction. It "
"moves the character and returns a leftover velocity after applying "
"collisions. When hitting the floor or a wall, the function will reduce or "
"reset the speed in that direction from you. In our case, storing the "
"function's returned value prevents the character from accumulating vertical "
"momentum, which could otherwise get so big the character would move through "
"the ground slab after a while."
msgstr ""

msgid "And that's all the code you need to move the character on the floor."

"something."
