"**Every game engine is different and fits different needs.** Not only do "
"they offer a range of features, the design of each engine is unique. This "
"leads to different workflows and different ways to form your games’ "
"structures. This all stems from their respective design philosophies."

"This page is here to help you understand how Godot works, starting with some "
"of its core pillars. It is not a list of available features, nor is it an "
"engine comparison. To know if any engine can be a good fit for your project, "
"you need to try it out for yourself and understand its design and "
"limitations."

"Godot embraces object-oriented design at its core with its flexible scene "

"For one, Godot lets you **compose or aggregate** scenes. It's like nested "
"prefabs: you can create a BlinkingLight scene and a BrokenLantern scene that "
"uses the BlinkingLight. Then, create a city filled with BrokenLanterns. "
"Change the BlinkingLight's color, save, and all the BrokenLanterns in the "
"city will update instantly."

"A Godot scene could be a Weapon, a Character, an Item, a Door, a Level, part "
"of a level… anything you’d like. It works like a class in pure code except "
"you’re free to design it by using the editor, using only the code, or mixing "
"and matching the two."

"It’s different from prefabs you find in several 3D engines as you can then "
"inherit from and extend those scenes. You may create a Magician that extends "
"your Character. Modify the Character in the editor and the Magician will "
"update as well. It helps you build your projects so that their structure "
"matches the game’s design."
