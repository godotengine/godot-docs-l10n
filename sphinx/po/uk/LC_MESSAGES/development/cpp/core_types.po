msgid "Core types"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot has a rich set of classes and templates that compose its core, and "
"everything is built upon them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This reference will try to list them in order for their better understanding."
msgstr ""

msgid "Definitions"
msgstr "Визначення"

msgid ""
"Godot uses the standard C99 datatypes, such as ``uint8_t``, ``uint32_t``, "
"``int64_t``, etc. which are nowadays supported by every compiler. "
"Reinventing the wheel for those is not fun, as it makes code more difficult "
"to read."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, care is not taken to use the most efficient datatype for a given "
"task unless using large structures or arrays. ``int`` is used through most "
"of the code unless necessary. This is done because nowadays every device has "
"at least a 32 bits bus and can do such operations in one cycle. It makes "
"code more readable too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For files or memory sizes, ``size_t`` is used, which is warranted to be 64 "
"bits."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For Unicode characters, CharType instead of wchar_t is used, because many "
"architectures have 4 bytes long wchar_t, where 2 bytes might be desired. "
"However, by default, this has not been forced and CharType maps directly to "
"wchar_t."

msgid "Memory model"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"PC is a wonderful architecture. Computers often have gigabytes of RAM, "
"terabytes of storage and gigahertz of CPU, and when an application needs "
"more resources the OS will swap out the inactive ones. Other architectures "
"(like mobile or consoles) are in general more limited."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The most common memory model is the heap, where an application will request "
"a region of memory, and the underlying OS will try to fit it somewhere and "
"return it. This often works best and is flexible, but over time and with "
"abuse, this can lead to segmentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Segmentation slowly creates holes that are too small for most common "
"allocations, so that memory is wasted. There is a lot of literature about "
"heap and segmentation, so this topic will not be developed further here. "
"Modern operating systems use paged memory, which helps mitigate the problem "
"of segmentation but doesn't solve it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, in many studies and tests, it is shown that given enough memory, if "
"the maximum allocation size is below a given threshold in proportion to the "
"maximum heap size and proportion of memory intended to be unused, "
"segmentation will not be a problem over time as it will remain constant. In "
"other words, leave 10-20% of your memory free and perform all small "
"allocations and you are fine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot ensures that all objects that can be allocated dynamically are small "
"(less than a few kb at most). But what happens if an allocation is too large "
"(like an image or mesh geometry or large array)? In this case Godot has the "
"option to use a dynamic memory pool. This memory needs to be locked to be "
"accessed, and if an allocation runs out of memory, the pool will be "
"rearranged and compacted on demand. Depending on the need of the game, the "
"programmer can configure the dynamic memory pool size."
msgstr ""

msgid "Allocating memory"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot has many tools for tracking memory usage in a game, especially during "
"debug. Because of this, the regular C and C++ library calls should not be "
"used. Instead, a few other ones are provided."
msgstr ""

msgid "For C-style allocation, Godot provides a few macros:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These are equivalent to the usual malloc, realloc, free of the standard C "
"library."
msgstr ""

msgid "For C++-style allocation, special macros are provided:"
msgstr ""

msgid "which are equivalent to new, delete, new[] and delete[]."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"memnew/memdelete also use a little C++ magic and notify Objects right after "
"they are created, and right before they are deleted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For dynamic memory, the PoolVector<> template is provided. PoolVector is a "
"standard vector class, and is very similar to vector in the C++ standard "
"library. To create a PoolVector buffer, use this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"PoolVector can be accessed using the [] operator and a few helpers exist for "
"this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These operations allow fast read/write from PoolVectors and keep it locked "
"until they go out of scope. However, PoolVectors should be used for small, "
"dynamic memory operations, as read() and write() are too slow for a large "
"amount of accesses."

"They are simple and aim to be as minimal as possible, as templates in C++ "

msgid "The Vector<> class also has a few nice features:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It does copy on write, so making copies of it is cheap as long as they are "
"not modified."

"counter."
