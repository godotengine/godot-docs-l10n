"This page describes the C++ implementation of objects in Godot. Looking for "
"the Object class reference? :ref:`Have a look here. <class_Object>`"
msgstr ""

msgid "General definition"
msgstr "Загальне визначення"

msgid ""
":ref:`Object <class_object>` is the base class for almost everything. Most "
"classes in Godot inherit directly or indirectly from it. Objects provide "
"reflection and editable properties, and declaring them is a matter of using "
"a single macro like this."
msgstr ""

msgid "This makes Objects gain a lot of functionality, like for example"

msgid "Registering an Object"
msgstr "Реєстрація об'єкта"

msgid ""
"ClassDB is a static class that holds the entire list of registered classes "
"that inherit from Object, as well as dynamic bindings to all their methods "
"properties and integer constants."
msgstr ""

msgid "Classes are registered by calling:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Registering it will allow the class to be instanced by scripts, code, or "
"creating them again when deserializing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Registering as virtual is the same but it can't be instanced."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Object-derived classes can override the static function ``static void "
"_bind_methods()``. When one class is registered, this static function is "
"called to register all the object methods, properties, constants, etc. It's "
"only called once. If an Object derived class is instanced but has not been "
"registered, it will be registered as virtual automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Inside ``_bind_methods``, there are a couple of things that can be done. "
"Registering functions is one:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Default values for arguments can be passed in reverse order:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``D_METHOD`` is a macro that converts \"methodname\" to a StringName for "
"more efficiency. Argument names are used for introspection, but when "
"compiling on release, the macro ignores them, so the strings are unused and "
"optimized away."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check ``_bind_methods`` of Control or Object for more examples."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If just adding modules and functionality that is not expected to be "
"documented as thoroughly, the ``D_METHOD()`` macro can safely be ignored and "
"a string passing the name can be passed for brevity."

msgid "Constants"
msgstr "Константи"

msgid "Classes often have enums such as:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For these to work when binding to methods, the enum must be declared "
"convertible to int, for this a macro is provided:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The constants can also be bound inside ``_bind_methods``, by using:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Properties (set/get)"
msgstr "Властивості (встановити/отримати)"

msgid "Objects export properties, properties are useful for the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Serializing and deserializing the object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a list of editable values for the Object derived class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Properties are usually defined by the PropertyInfo() class. Usually "
"constructed as:"
msgstr ""

msgid "For example:"
msgstr "Приклад:"

msgid ""
"This is an integer property, named \"amount\", hint is a range, range goes "
"from 0 to 49 in steps of 1 (integers). It is only usable for the editor "
"(edit value visually) but won't be serialized."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another example:"
msgstr "Ще один приклад:"

msgid ""
"This is a string property, can take any string but the editor will only "
"allow the defined hint ones. Since no usage flags were specified, the "
"default ones are PROPERTY_USAGE_STORAGE and PROPERTY_USAGE_EDITOR."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are plenty of hints and usage flags available in object.h, give them a "
"check."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Properties can also work like C# properties and be accessed from script "
"using indexing, but this usage is generally discouraged, as using functions "
"is preferred for legibility. Many properties are also bound with categories, "
"such as \"animation/frame\" which also make indexing impossible unless using "
"operator []."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From ``_bind_methods()``, properties can be created and bound as long as set/"
"get functions exist. Example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This creates the property using the setter and the getter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Binding properties using ``_set``/``_get``/``_get_property_list``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An additional method of creating properties exists when more flexibility is "
"desired (i.e. adding or removing properties on context)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following functions can be overridden in an Object derived class, they "
"are NOT virtual, DO NOT make them virtual, they are called for every "
"override and the previous ones are not invalidated (multilevel call)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is also a little less efficient since ``p_property`` must be compared "
"against the desired names in serial order."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dynamic casting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides dynamic casting between Object-derived classes, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If cast fails, NULL is returned. This system uses RTTI, but it also works "
"fine (although a bit slower) when RTTI is disabled. This is useful on "
"platforms where a small binary size is ideal, such as HTML5 or consoles "
"(with low memory footprint)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signals"
msgstr "Сигнали"

msgid ""
"Objects can have a set of signals defined (similar to Delegates in other "
"languages). Connecting to them is rather easy:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The method ``_node_entered_tree`` must be registered to the class using "
"``ClassDB::bind_method`` (explained before)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Adding signals to a class is done in ``_bind_methods``, using the "
"``ADD_SIGNAL`` macro, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Notifications"
msgstr "Сповіщення"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"All objects in Godot have a :ref:`_notification "
"<class_Object_method__notification>` method that allows it to respond to "
"engine level callbacks that may relate to it. More information can be found "
"on the :ref:`doc_godot_notifications` page."
msgstr ""
"Кожен об'єкт у Godot реалізує метод :ref:`_notification "
"<class_Object_method__notification>`. Його мета - дозволити Об'єкту "
"реагувати на різноманітні зворотні виклики на рівні движка, які можуть "
"стосуватися його. Наприклад, якщо движок каже :ref:`CanvasItem "
"<class_CanvasItem>` \"малювати\" *(\"draw\")*, він викликає "
"``_notification(NOTIFICATION_DRAW)``."

msgid "References"
msgstr "Посилання"

msgid ""
":ref:`Reference <class_reference>` inherits from Object and holds a "
"reference count. It is the base for reference counted object types. "
"Declaring them must be done using Ref<> template. For example:"

"templates point to it."

":ref:`Resource <class_resource>` inherits from Reference, so all resources "
"are reference counted. Resources can optionally contain a path, which "
"reference a file on disk. This can be set with ``resource.set_path(path)``. "
"This is normally done by the resource loader though. No two different "
"resources can have the same path, attempt to do so will result in an error."
