"This page describes the typical workflow of the bug triage team aka bugsquad "
"when handling issues and pull requests on Godot's `GitHub repository "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`__. It is bound to evolve together "
"with the bugsquad, so do not hesitate to propose modifications to the "
"following guidelines."

msgid "GitHub proposes various features to manage issues:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Set one or several labels from a predefined list"
msgstr ""

msgid "Set one milestone from a predefined list"
msgstr ""

msgid "Keep track of the issue in the project dashboard"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Define one contributor as \"assignee\" among the Godot engine organization "
"members"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As the Godot engine organization on GitHub currently has a restricted number "
"of contributors, we do not use assignees extensively for now. All "
"contributors are welcome to take on any issue, if relevant after mentioning "
"it on the issue ticket and/or discussing the best way to resolve it with "
"other developers."
msgstr ""

msgid "For the time being, we do not use the project dashboard feature either."

msgid ""
"As far as possible, we try to assign labels (and milestones, when relevant) "
"to both issues and pull requests."

msgid "Labels"
msgstr "Мітки"

msgid "The following labels are currently defined in the Godot repository:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Categories:**"
msgstr "Категорії"

msgid ""
"*Archived*: either a duplicate of another issue, or invalid. Such an issue "
"would also be closed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Breaks compat*: describes something that can only be fixed by breaking "
"compatibility with existing projects."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Bug*: describes something that is not working properly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Cherrypick*: describes something that can be backported to a stable branch "
"after being merged in the ``master`` branch."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Crash:* describes a bug that causes the engine to crash. This label is only "
"used for \"hard\" crashes, not freezes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Confirmed*: has been confirmed by at least one other contributor than the "
"bug reporter (typically for *Bug* reports). The purpose of this label is to "
"let developers know which issues are still reproducible when they want to "
"select what to work on. It is therefore a good practice to add in a comment "
"on what platform and what version or commit of Godot the issue could be "
"reproduced; if a developer looks at the issue one year later, the "
"*Confirmed* label may not be relevant anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Discussion*: the issue is not consensual and needs further discussion to "
"define what exactly should be done to address the topic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Documentation*: issue related to the documentation. Mainly to request "
"enhancements in the API documentation. Issues related to the ReadTheDocs "
"documentation should be filed on the `godot-docs <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot-docs>`_ repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Enhancement*: describes a proposed enhancement to an existing functionality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Feature proposal*: describes a wish for a new feature to be implemented. "
"Note that the main Godot repository no longer accepts feature requests. "
"Please use `godot-proposals <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-"
"proposals>`__ instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*For PR meeting*: the issue needs to be discussed in a pull request meeting. "
"These meetings are public and are held on the `Godot Contributors Chat "
"<https://chat.godotengine.org/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Good first issue*: the issue is *assumed* to be an easy one to fix, which "
"makes it a great fit for new contributors who need to become familiar with "
"the code base."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*High priority:* the issue is particularly important as it can prevent "
"people from releasing their projects or cause data loss."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Needs work*: the pull request needs additional work before it can be merged."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Needs testing*: the issue/pull request could not be completely tested and "
"thus need further testing. This can mean that it needs to be tested on "
"different hardware/software configurations or even that the steps to "
"reproduce are not certain."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Performance*: issues that directly impact engine or editor performance. Can "
"also be used for pull requests that improve performance or add low-end-"
"friendly options. Should not be coupled with *Usability*."
msgstr ""

"especially welcome. Note that this **doesn't** mean you can't work on issues "
"without these labels."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Regression*: the bug appeared after a stable release not exhibiting the bug "
"was released."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Salvageable*: the pull request can't be merged due to design issues or "
"merge conflicts and its author is not active anymore. However, it can still "
"be picked up by an external contributor to bring it to a mergeable state. To "
"do so, you need to open a new pull request based on the original pull "
"request."

msgid ""
"*Tracker*: issue used to track other issues (like all issues related to the "
"plugin system)."

msgstr ""
"*Usability*: вади, які безпосередньо стосуються зручності у користуванні."

msgid ""
"The categories are used for general triage of the issues. They can be "
"combined in some way when relevant, e.g. an issue can be labelled "
"*Enhancement* and *Usability* at the same time if it's an issue to improve "
"usability. Or *Feature proposal* and *Discussion* if it's a non-consensual "
"feature request, or one that is not precise enough to be worked on."
