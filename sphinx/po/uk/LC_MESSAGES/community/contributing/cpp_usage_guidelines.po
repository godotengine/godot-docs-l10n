msgid "Rationale"
msgstr "Підґрунтя"

msgid ""
"Since Godot 4.0, the C++ standard used throughout the codebase is a subset "
"of **C++17**. While modern C++ brings a lot of opportunities to write "
"faster, more readable code, we chose to restrict our usage of C++ to a "
"subset for a few reasons:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It makes it easier to review code in online editors. This is because engine "
"contributors don't always have access to a full-featured IDE while reviewing "
"code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It makes the code easier to grasp for beginner contributors (who may not be "
"professional C++ programmers). Godot's codebase is known to be easy to learn "
"from, and we'd like to keep it that way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get your pull request merged, it needs to follow the C++ usage guidelines "
"outlined here. Of course, you can use features not allowed here in your own "
"C++ modules or GDNative scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Prior to Godot 4.0, the C++ standard used throughout the codebase was C++03, "
"with a handful of C++14 extensions. If you are contributing a pull request "
"to the `3.x` branch rather than `master`, your code can't use C++17 "
"features. Instead, your code must be able to be built with a C++14 compiler."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The guidelines below don't apply to third-party dependencies, although we "
"generally favor small libraries instead of larger solutions. See also :ref:"
"`doc_best_practices_for_engine_contributors`."

msgid "Disallowed features"
msgstr "Кожен має різні переваги:"

msgid ""
"**Any feature not listed below is allowed.** Using features like "
"``constexpr`` variables and ``nullptr`` is encouraged when possible. Still, "
"try to keep your use of modern C++ features conservative. Their use needs to "
"serve a real purpose, such as improving code readability or performance."

msgid "Standard Template Library"
msgstr "Чому Godot не використовує STL (Standard Template Library)"

msgid ""
"We don't allow using the `STL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Standard_Template_Library>`__ as Godot provides its own data types (among "
"other things). See :ref:`doc_faq_why_not_stl` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means that pull requests should **not** use ``std::string``, ``std::"
"vector`` and the like. Instead, use Godot's datatypes as described below:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Use ``String`` instead of ``std::string``."
msgstr "Використовуйте ``or`` замість ``||``."

msgid ""
"Use ``Vector`` instead of ``std::vector``. In some cases, ``LocalVector`` "
"can be used as an alternative (ask core developers first)."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Use ``Array`` instead of ``std::array``."
msgstr "Використовуйте ``or`` замість ``||``."

msgid ""
"Godot also has a List datatype (which is a linked list). While List is "
"already used in the codebase, it typically performs worse than other "
"datatypes like Vector and Array. Therefore, List should be avoided in new "
"code unless necessary."

msgid "``auto`` keyword"
msgstr "Ключове слово `onready`"

msgid ""
"Please don't use the ``auto`` keyword for type inference. While it can avoid "
"repetition, it can also lead to confusing code:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind hover documentation often isn't readily available for pull "
"request reviewers. Most of the time, reviewers will use GitHub's online "
"viewer to review pull requests."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We chose to forbid ``auto`` instead of allowing it on a case-by-case basis "
"to avoid having to decide on difficult edge cases. Thank you for your "
"understanding."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lambdas"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Lambdas should be used conservatively when they make code effectively faster "
"or simpler, and do not impede readability. Please ask before using lambdas "
"in a pull request."
msgstr ""

msgid "``#pragma once`` directive"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To follow the existing style, please use standard ``#ifdef``-based include "
"guards instead of ``#pragma once`` in new files."
