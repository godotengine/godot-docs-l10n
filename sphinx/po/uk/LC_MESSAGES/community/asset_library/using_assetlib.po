"As mentioned before, you can access the web frontend of the Asset Library on "
"`Godot's official website <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_. "
"This is what it looks like when you first visit it:"

"At the top, you see the **header**, which takes you to various other parts "

msgid ""
"In the center is the **search bar + settings** section, and the **assets** "
"section below it - this lets you filter out certain kinds of assets based on "
"a host of criteria. These include the asset **category** (such as 2D tools, "
"scripts and demos), **engine version** they are intended for, **sorting "
"order** (by update date, by name, etc.) and **support level**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While most other filter settings should be fairly self-explanatory, it's "
"worth going over what \"support level\" means in the Asset Library. "
"Currently there are three support levels, and each asset can belong to only "
"one."

msgid ""
"**Official** assets are created and maintained by the official Godot Engine "
"developers. Currently, these include the official engine demos, which "

"**Community** assets are submitted and maintained by the members of the "
"Godot community."

"**Testing** assets are works-in-progress, and may contain bugs and usability "
"issues. They are not recommended for use in serious projects, but you are "
"encouraged to download, test them, and submit issues to the original authors."

"You can mix and match any of the search filters and criteria, and upon "
