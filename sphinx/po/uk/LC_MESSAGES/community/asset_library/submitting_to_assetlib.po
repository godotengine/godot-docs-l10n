msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Вступ"

msgid ""
"This tutorial aims to serve as a guide on how you can submit your own assets "
"to the `Godot Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_ "
"and share them with the Godot community."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the :ref:`doc_using_assetlib` document, in order to be able "
"to submit assets to the AssetLib, you need to have a registered account, and "
"be logged in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Submission guidelines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before submitting your asset, please ensure it follows all of the "
"requirements, and also consider following the recommendations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Requirements"
msgstr "Вимоги"

msgid ""
"Generally speaking, most assets people submit to the asset library are "
"accepted. However, in order for your asset to be accepted, there are a few "
"requirements your asset needs to meet to be approved."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The asset must **work**. If the asset doesn't run or otherwise doesn't work "
"in the specified Godot version, then it will be rejected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The asset must have a proper **.gitignore** file. It's important to keep "
"redundant data out of the repository. `Here's a template. <https://raw."
"githubusercontent.com/aaronfranke/gitignore/godot/Godot.gitignore>`_"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No **submodules**, or any submodules must be non-essential. GitHub does not "
"include submodules in the downloaded ZIP file, so if the asset needs the "
"contents of the submodule, your asset won't work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **license** needs to be correct. The license listed on the asset library "
"must match the license in the repository. The repo MUST have a license file, "
"called either \"LICENSE\" or \"LICENSE.md\". This file must contain the "
"license text itself and a copyright statement that includes the year(s) and "
"copyright holder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use proper **English** for the name and description of your asset. This "
"includes using correct capitalization, and using full sentences in the "
"description. You can also include other languages, but there should at least "
"be an English version."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The icon link must be a **direct link**. For icons hosted on GitHub, the "
"link must start with \"raw.githubusercontent.com\", not \"github.com\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Recommendations"
msgstr "Перейменувати анімацію"

msgid ""
"These things are not required for your asset to be approved, but if you "
"follow these recommendations, you can help make the asset library a better "
"place for all users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Fix or suppress all script **warnings**. The warning system is there to help "
"identify issues with your code, but people using your asset don't need to "
"see them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make your code conform to the official **style guides**. Having a consistent "
"style helps other people read your code, and it also helps if other people "
"wish to contribute to your asset. See: the :ref:`doc_gdscript_styleguide` or "
"the :ref:`doc_c_sharp_styleguide`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have screenshots in your repo, place them in their own subfolder and "
"add an empty **.gdignore** file in the same folder (note: **gd**, not "
"**git**). This prevents Godot from importing your screenshots. On Windows, "
"open a command prompt in the project folder and run ``type nul > .gdignore`` "
"to create a file whose name starts with a period."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your asset is a library for working with other files, consider including "
"**example files** in the asset."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider adding a **.gitattributes** file to your repo. This file allows "
"giving extra instructions to Git, such as specifying line endings and "
"listing files not required for your asset to function with the ``export-"
"ignore`` directive. This directive removes such files from the resulting ZIP "
"file, preventing them from being downloaded by the asset library users. "
"These are common examples of **.gitattributes**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Projects / Templates"
msgstr "Шаблони, визначені проєктом"

msgid "Addons / Asset Packs"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are submitting a plugin, add a **copy** of your license and readme to "
"the plugin folder itself. This is the folder that users are guaranteed to "
"keep with their project, so a copy ensures they always have those files "
"handy (and helps them fulfill your licensing terms)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **icon** should be a square, its aspect ratio should be 1:1. It should "
"also ideally have a minimum resolution of 64x64 pixels."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While the asset library allows more than just GitHub, consider hosting your "
"asset's source code on **GitHub**. Other services may not work reliably, and "
"a lack of familiarity can be a barrier to contributors."
msgstr ""

msgid "Submitting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you are logged in, you will be able to head over to the \"Submit "
"Assets\" page of the AssetLib, which will look like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "|image0|"
msgstr "|image0|"

msgid "image0"
msgstr "image0"

msgid ""
"While it may look like a lot (and there is more as you scroll down), each "
"field is described in terms of what you should put in. We will nonetheless "
"go over what is required in the submission form here as well."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Asset Name**:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The name of your asset. Should be a unique, descriptive title of what your "
"asset is."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Category**:"
msgstr "**Категорія**:"

msgid ""
"The category that your asset belongs to, and will be shown in search "
"results. The category is split into **Addons** and **Projects**. In-editor, "
"assets of the Project type (Templates, Demos, Projects) only show up when "
"viewing the AssetLib from the Project Manager, while assets of the Addon "
"type will only be visible from inside a project."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Godot version**:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The version of the engine that the asset works with. Currently, it's not "
"possible to have a single asset entry contain downloads for multiple engine "
"versions, so you may need to re-submit the asset multiple times, with an "
"entry for each Godot version it supports. This is particularly important "
"when dealing with major versions of the engine, such as Godot 2.x and Godot "
"3.x."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Version**:"
msgstr "**Версія**:"

msgid ""
"The version number of the asset. While you are free to choose and use any "
"versioning scheme that you like, you may want to look into something such as "
"`SemVer <https://semver.org>`_ if you want your asset's versioning scheme to "
"be clear and consistent. Note that there is also an internal version number, "
"incremented every time the asset download URL is changed or updated."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Repository host**:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assets uploaded to the AssetLib are not hosted on it directly. Instead, they "
"point to repositories hosted on third-party Git providers, such as GitHub, "
"GitLab or Bitbucket. This is where you choose which provider your asset "
"uses, so the site can compute the final download link."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Repository URL**:"
msgstr "Адреса сховища:"

msgid ""
"The URL to your asset's files/webpage. This will vary based on your choice "
"of provider, but it should look similar to `https://github.com/<user>/"
"<project>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Issues URL**:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The URL to your asset's issue tracker. Again, this will differ from "
"repository host to repository host, but will likely look similar to `https://"
"github.com/<user>/<project>/issues`. You may leave this field empty if you "
"use your provider's issue tracker, and it's part of the same repository."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Download Commit**:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The commit of the asset. For example, "
"`b1d3172f89b86e52465a74f63a74ac84c491d3e1`. The site computes the actual "
"download URL from this."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Icon URL**:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The URL to your asset's icon (which will be used as a thumbnail in the "
"AssetLib search results and on the asset's page). Should be an image in "
"either the PNG or JPG format."
msgstr ""

msgid "**License**:"
msgstr "**Ліцензія**:"

msgid ""
"The license under which you are distributing the asset. The list includes a "
"variety of free and open-source software licenses, such as GPL (v2 and v3), "
"MIT, BSD and Boost Software License. You can visit `OpenSource.org <https://"
"opensource.org>`_ for a detailed description of each of the listed licenses."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Description**:"
msgstr "**Опис**:"

msgid ""
"Finally, you can use the Description field for a textual overview of your "
"asset, its features and behavior, a changelog, et cetera. In the future, "
"formatting with Markdown will be supported, but currently, your only option "
"is plain text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may also include up to three video and/or image previews, which will be "
"shown at the bottom of the asset page. Use the \"Enable\" checkbox on each "
"of the preview submission boxes to enable them."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Type**:"
msgstr "**Тип**:"

msgid "Either an image, or a video."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Image/YouTube URL**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Either a link to the image, or to a video, hosted on YouTube."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Thumbnail URL**:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A URL to an image that will be used as a thumbnail for the preview. This "
"option will be removed eventually, and thumbnails will be automatically "
"computed instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you are done, press \"Submit\". Your asset will be entered into the "
"review queue. You can check all assets currently pending a review `here "
"<https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/edit?&asset=-1>`_ . The "
"approval process is manual and may take up to a few days for your asset to "
"be accepted (or rejected), so please be patient!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may have some luck accelerating the approval process by messaging the "
"moderators and AssetLib reviewers on the `Godot Contributors Chat <https://"
"chat.godotengine.org/>`_, or the official Discord server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You will be informed when your asset is reviewed. If it was rejected, you "
"will be told why that may have been, and you will be able to submit it again "
"with the appropriate changes."
