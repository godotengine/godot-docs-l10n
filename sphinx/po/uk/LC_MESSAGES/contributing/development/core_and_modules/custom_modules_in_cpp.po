"Godot allows extending the engine in a modular way. New modules can be "
"created and then enabled/disabled. This allows for adding new engine "
"functionality at every level without modifying the core, which can be split "
"for use and reuse in different modules."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Modules are located in the ``modules/`` subdirectory of the build system. By "
"default, dozens of modules are enabled, such as GDScript (which, yes, is not "
"part of the base engine), the Mono runtime, a regular expressions module, "
"and others. As many new modules as desired can be created and combined. The "
"SCons build system will take care of it transparently."
msgstr ""

msgid "What for?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While it's recommended that most of a game be written in scripting (as it is "
"an enormous time saver), it's perfectly possible to use C++ instead. Adding "
"C++ modules can be useful in the following scenarios:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Binding an external library to Godot (like PhysX, FMOD, etc)."

msgid "Creating a new module"
msgstr "Створення модуля"

msgid ""
"Before creating a module, make sure to :ref:`download the source code of "
"Godot and compile it <toc-devel-compiling>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a new module, the first step is creating a directory inside "
"``modules/``. If you want to maintain the module separately, you can "
"checkout a different VCS into modules and use it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The example module will be called \"summator\" (``godot/modules/summator``). "
"Inside we will create a summator class:"
msgstr ""

msgid "And then the cpp file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, the new class needs to be registered somehow, so two more files need "
"to be created:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These files must be in the top-level folder of your module (next to your "
"``SCsub`` and ``config.py`` files) for the module to be registered properly."
msgstr ""

msgid "These files should contain the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, we need to create a ``SCsub`` file so the build system compiles this "
"module:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With multiple sources, you can also add each file individually to a Python "
"string list:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This allows for powerful possibilities using Python to construct the file "
"list using loops and logic statements. Look at some modules that ship with "
"Godot by default for examples."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add include directories for the compiler to look at you can append it to "
"the environment's paths:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to add custom compiler flags when building your module, you need "
"to clone ``env`` first, so it won't add those flags to whole Godot build "
"(which can cause errors). Example ``SCsub`` with custom flags:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And finally, the configuration file for the module, this is a Python script "
"that must be named ``config.py``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module is asked if it's OK to build for the specific platform (in this "
"case, ``True`` means it will build for every platform)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And that's it. Hope it was not too complex! Your module should look like "
"this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can then zip it and share the module with everyone else. When building "
"for every platform (instructions in the previous sections), your module will "
"be included."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a parameter limit of 5 in C++ modules for things such as "
"subclasses. This can be raised to 13 by including the header file ``core/"
"method_bind_ext.gen.inc``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the module"
msgstr "Користування модулем"

msgid "You can now use your newly created module from any script:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The output will be ``60``."

msgid ""
"The previous Summator example is great for small, custom modules, but what "
"if you want to use a larger, external library? Refer to :ref:"
"`doc_binding_to_external_libraries` for details about binding to external "
"libraries."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your module is meant to be accessed from the running project (not just "
"from the editor), you must also recompile every export template you plan to "
"use, then specify the path to the custom template in each export preset. "
"Otherwise, you'll get errors when running the project as the module isn't "
"compiled in the export template. See the :ref:`Compiling <toc-devel-"
"compiling>` pages for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compiling a module externally"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compiling a module involves moving the module's sources directly under the "
"engine's ``modules/`` directory. While this is the most straightforward way "
"to compile a module, there are a couple of reasons as to why this might not "
"be a practical thing to do:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Having to manually copy modules sources every time you want to compile the "
"engine with or without the module, or taking additional steps needed to "
"manually disable a module during compilation with a build option similar to "
"``module_summator_enabled=no``. Creating symbolic links may also be a "
"solution, but you may additionally need to overcome OS restrictions like "
"needing the symbolic link privilege if doing this via script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Depending on whether you have to work with the engine's source code, the "
"module files added directly to ``modules/`` changes the working tree to the "
"point where using a VCS (like ``git``) proves to be cumbersome as you need "
"to make sure that only the engine-related code is committed by filtering "
"changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So if you feel like the independent structure of custom modules is needed, "
"lets take our \"summator\" module and move it to the engine's parent "
"directory:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compile the engine with our module by providing ``custom_modules`` build "
"option which accepts a comma-separated list of directory paths containing "
"custom C++ modules, similar to the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The build system shall detect all modules under the ``../modules`` directory "
"and compile them accordingly, including our \"summator\" module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any path passed to ``custom_modules`` will be converted to an absolute path "
"internally as a way to distinguish between custom and built-in modules. It "
"means that things like generating module documentation may rely on a "
"specific path structure on your machine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Introduction to the buildsystem - Custom modules build option "
"<doc_buildsystem_custom_modules>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customizing module types initialization"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Modules can interact with other built-in engine classes during runtime and "
"even affect the way core types are initialized. So far, we've been using "
"``register_summator_types`` as a way to bring in module classes to be "
"available within the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A crude order of the engine setup can be summarized as a list of the "
"following type registration methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our ``Summator`` class is initialized during the ``register_module_types()`` "
"call. Imagine that we need to satisfy some common module run-time dependency "
"(like singletons), or allow us to override existing engine method callbacks "
"before they can be assigned by the engine itself. In that case, we want to "
"ensure that our module classes are registered *before* any other built-in "
"type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is where we can define an optional ``preregister_summator_types()`` "
"method which will be called before anything else during the "
"``preregister_module_types()`` engine setup stage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We now need to add this method to ``register_types`` header and source files:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike other register methods, we have to explicitly define "
"``MODULE_SUMMATOR_HAS_PREREGISTER`` to let the build system know what "
"relevant method calls to include at compile time. The module's name has to "
"be converted to uppercase as well."
msgstr ""

msgid "Improving the build system for development"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This shared library support is not designed to support distributing a module "
"to other users without recompiling the engine. For that purpose, use a "
"GDExtension instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So far, we defined a clean SCsub that allows us to add the sources of our "
"new module as part of the Godot binary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This static approach is fine when we want to build a release version of our "
"game, given we want all the modules in a single binary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, the trade-off is that every single change requires a full "
"recompilation of the game. Even though SCons is able to detect and recompile "
"only the file that was changed, finding such files and eventually linking "
"the final binary takes a long time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The solution to avoid such a cost is to build our own module as a shared "
"library that will be dynamically loaded when starting our game's binary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once compiled, we should end up with a ``bin`` directory containing both the "
"``godot*`` binary and our ``libsummator*.so``. However given the .so is not "
"in a standard directory (like ``/usr/lib``), we have to help our binary find "
"it during runtime with the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You have to ``export`` the environment variable. Otherwise, you won't be "
"able to run your project from the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On top of that, it would be nice to be able to select whether to compile our "
"module as shared library (for development) or as a part of the Godot binary "
"(for release). To do that we can define a custom flag to be passed to SCons "
"using the ``ARGUMENT`` command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now by default ``scons`` command will build our module as part of Godot's "
"binary and as a shared library when passing ``summator_shared=yes``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, you can even speed up the build further by explicitly specifying "
"your shared module as target in the SCons command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Writing custom documentation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Writing documentation may seem like a boring task, but it is highly "
"recommended to document your newly created module to make it easier for "
"users to benefit from it. Not to mention that the code you've written one "
"year ago may become indistinguishable from the code that was written by "
"someone else, so be kind to your future self!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are several steps in order to setup custom docs for the module:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make a new directory in the root of the module. The directory name can be "
"anything, but we'll be using the ``doc_classes`` name throughout this "
"section."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, we need to edit ``config.py``, add the following snippet:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``get_doc_path()`` function is used by the build system to determine the "
"location of the docs. In this case, they will be located in the ``modules/"
"summator/doc_classes`` directory. If you don't define this, the doc path for "
"your module will fall back to the main ``doc/classes`` directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``get_doc_classes()`` method is necessary for the build system to know "
"which registered classes belong to the module. You need to list all of your "
"classes here. The classes that you don't list will end up in the main ``doc/"
"classes`` directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use Git to check if you have missed some of your classes by checking "
"the untracked files with ``git status``. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Example output::"
msgstr "Приклад:"

msgid "Now we can generate the documentation:"
msgstr "Тепер ми можемо створити документацію:"

msgid ""
"We can do this via running Godot's doctool i.e. ``godot --doctool <path>``, "
"which will dump the engine API reference to the given ``<path>`` in XML "
"format."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our case we'll point it to the root of the cloned repository. You can "
"point it to an another folder, and just copy over the files that you need."
msgstr ""

msgid "Run command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now if you go to the ``godot/modules/summator/doc_classes`` folder, you will "
"see that it contains a ``Summator.xml`` file, or any other classes, that you "
"referenced in your ``get_doc_classes`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Edit the file(s) following :ref:`doc_class_reference_primer` and recompile "
"the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the compilation process is finished, the docs will become accessible "
"within the engine's built-in documentation system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to keep documentation up-to-date, all you'll have to do is simply "
"modify one of the XML files and recompile the engine from now on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you change your module's API, you can also re-extract the docs, they will "
"contain the things that you previously added. Of course if you point it to "
"your godot folder, make sure you don't lose work by extracting older docs "
"from an older engine build on top of the newer ones."

"you might encounter an error similar to the following:"

msgid "Writing custom unit tests"

"It's possible to write self-contained unit tests as part of a C++ module. If "
"you are not familiar with the unit testing process in Godot yet, please "
"refer to :ref:`doc_unit_testing`."

msgid "The procedure is the following:"
msgstr "Є такі застереження:"

msgid "Create a new directory named ``tests/`` under your module's root:"

msgid ""
"Create a new test suite: ``test_summator.h``. The header must be prefixed "
"with ``test_`` so that the build system can collect it and include it as "
"part of the ``tests/test_main.cpp`` where the tests are run."

msgid "Adding custom editor icons"
msgstr "Додавання нетипових черг обробки звукових даних"

msgid ""
"Similarly to how you can write self-contained documentation within a module, "
"you can also create your own custom icons for classes to appear in the "
"editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the actual process of creating editor icons to be integrated within the "
"engine, please refer to :ref:`doc_editor_icons` first."
msgstr ""

msgid "Once you've created your icon(s), proceed with the following steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make a new directory in the root of the module named ``icons``. This is the "
"default path for the engine to look for module's editor icons."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Move your newly created ``svg`` icons (optimized or not) into that folder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Recompile the engine and run the editor. Now the icon(s) will appear in "
"editor's interface where appropriate."

msgid "Use ``GDCLASS`` macro for inheritance, so Godot can wrap it."

msgid ""
"Use ``_bind_methods`` to bind your functions to scripting, and to allow them "
"to work as callbacks for signals."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Avoid multiple inheritance for classes exposed to Godot**, as ``GDCLASS`` "
"doesn't support this. You can still use multiple inheritance in your own "
"classes as long as they're not exposed to Godot's scripting API."

"But this is not all, depending what you do, you will be greeted with some "
"(hopefully positive) surprises."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you inherit from :ref:`class_Node` (or any derived node type, such as "
"Sprite2D), your new class will appear in the editor, in the inheritance tree "

msgid ""
"If you inherit from :ref:`class_Resource`, it will appear in the resource "
"list, and all the exposed properties can be serialized when saved/loaded."
