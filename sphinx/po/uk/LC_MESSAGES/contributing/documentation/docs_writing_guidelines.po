"The Godot community is rich and international. Users come from all around "
"the world. Some of them are young, and many aren't native English speakers. "
"That's why we must all write using a clear and a common language. For the "
"class reference, the goal is to make it easy to read for everyone and "
"precise."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the active voice when possible. Take the classes, methods, and constants "
"you describe as the subject. It's natural to write using the passive voice, "
"but it's harder to read and produces longer sentences."
msgstr ""

msgid "Passive:"
msgstr "Пасивний спосіб:"

msgid "Active:"
msgstr "Активний спосіб:"

msgid "**Don't** use the passive voice:"
msgstr "**Не** використовуйте пасивний спосіб:"

msgid "**Do** use the node's name as a noun:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Favor precise yet common verbs over generic ones like ``make``, ``set``, and "
"any expression you can replace with a single word."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Don't** repeat the method's name. It already states it sets the pivot "
"value to a new one:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Do** explain what's the consequence of this \"set\": use precise verbs "
"like ``place``, ``position``, ``rotate``, ``fade``, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The progressive forms describe continuous actions. E.g. \"is calling\", \"is "
"moving\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Don't** use the progressive form for instant changes."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Do** use simple present, past, or future."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exception: If the subject is not clear, replacing \"ing\" verbs is not an "
"improvement. For example, in the previous sentence, \"it replaces\" would "
"not make much sense where \"replacing\" currently is."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may use the progressive tense to describe actions that are continuous in "
"time. Anything like animation or coroutines."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Verbs can turn into adjectival nouns with -ing. This is not a conjugation, "
"so you may use them: ``the remaining movement``, ``the missing file``, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remove unnecessary adverbs and adjectives"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Write as few adjectives and adverbs as possible. Only use them if they add "
"key information to the description."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Don't** use redundant or meaningless adverbs. Words that lengthen the "
"documentation but don't add any information:"

"Game creation and programming aren't simple, and nothing's easy to someone "
"learning to use the API for the first time. Other words in the list, like "
"``just`` or ``actual`` won't add any info to the sentence. Don't use "
"corresponding adverbs either: obviously, simply, basically, easily, "
"actually, clearly."

"\"Simple\" never helps. Remember, for other users, anything could be complex "

msgid "Favor explicit references over implicit ones."

"**Don't** use words like \"the former\", \"the latter\", etc. They're not "

"If you need to repeat the same variable name 3 or 4 times, you probably need "

msgid ""
"The code examples in the documentation should follow a consistent style not "
"to confuse users. As static type hints are an optional feature of GDScript, "
"we chose to stick to writing dynamic code. This leads to writing GDScript "
"that is concise and accessible."

msgid "Use real-world code examples where appropriate"

msgid ""
"Real-world examples are more accessible to beginners than abstract ``foos`` "
"and ``bars``. You can also copy them directly from your game projects, "
"ensuring that any code snippet compiles without errors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Writing ``var speed = 10`` rather than ``var my_var = 10`` allows beginners "
"to understand code better. It gives them a frame of reference as to where "
"they could use the code snippets in a live project."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Don't** write made-up examples:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Do** write concrete examples:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Of course, there are times when using real-world examples is impractical. In "
"those situations, you should still avoid using names such as ``my_var``, "
"``foo()`` or ``my_func()`` and consider more meaningful names for your "
"examples."

"Notice the exception to the \"direct voice\" rule: with the move method, an "

"For boolean member variables, always use ``if true`` and/or ``if false``, to "

"Also, surround boolean values, variable names and methods with ``[code][/"
