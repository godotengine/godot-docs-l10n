msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Вступ"

msgid ""
"Sería excelente que el mundo hablara solo un idioma (It would be great if "
"the world spoke only one language). Unfortunately for us developers, that is "
"not the case. While indie or niche games usually do not need localization, "
"games targeting a more massive market often require localization. Godot "
"offers many tools to make this process more straightforward, so this "
"tutorial is more like a collection of tips and tricks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Localization is usually done by specific studios hired for the job and, "
"despite the huge amount of software and file formats available for this, the "
"most common way to do localization to this day is still with spreadsheets. "
"The process of creating the spreadsheets and importing them is already "
"covered in the :ref:`doc_importing_translations` tutorial, so this one could "
"be seen more like a follow-up to that one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We will be using the official demo as an example; you can `download it from "
"the Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/134>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuring the imported translation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Translations can get updated and re-imported when they change, but they "
"still have to be added to the project. This is done in **Project → Project "
"Settings → Localization**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The above dialog is used to add or remove translations project-wide."
msgstr ""

msgid "Localizing resources"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is also possible to instruct Godot to use alternate versions of assets "
"(resources) depending on the current language. The **Remaps** tab can be "
"used for this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select the resource to be remapped, then add some alternatives for each "
"locale."
msgstr ""

msgid "Converting keys to text"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some controls, such as :ref:`Button <class_Button>` and :ref:`Label "
"<class_Label>`, will automatically fetch a translation if their text matches "
"a translation key. For example, if a label's text is "
"\"MAIN_SCREEN_GREETING1\" and that key exists in the current translation, "
"then the text will automatically be translated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This automatic translation behavior may be undesirable in certain cases. For "
"instance, when using a Label to display a player's name, you most likely "
"don't want the player's name to be translated if it matches a translation "
"key. To disable automatic translation on a specific node, use :ref:`Object."
"set_message_translation<class_Object_method_set_message_translation>` and "
"send a :ref:`Object.notification<class_Object_method_notification>` to "
"update the translation::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more complex UI nodes such as OptionButtons, you may have to use this "
"instead::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In code, the :ref:`Object.tr() <class_Object_method_tr>` function can be "
"used. This will just look up the text in the translations and convert it if "
"found:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Making controls resizable"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same text in different languages can vary greatly in length. For this, "
"make sure to read the tutorial on :ref:`doc_size_and_anchors`, as "
"dynamically adjusting control sizes may help. :ref:`Container "
"<class_Container>` can be useful, as well as the text wrapping options "
"available in :ref:`Label <class_Label>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "TranslationServer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot has a server handling low-level translation management called the :ref:"
"`TranslationServer <class_TranslationServer>`. Translations can be added or "
"removed during run-time; the current language can also be changed at run-"
"time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Command line"
msgstr "Командний рядок"

msgid ""
"Language can be tested when running Godot from the command line. For "
"example, to test a game in French, the following argument can be supplied:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Translating the project name"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The project name becomes the app name when exporting to different operating "
"systems and platforms. To specify the project name in more than one "
"language, create a new setting ``application/name`` in the **Project "
"Settings** and append the locale identifier to it. For instance, for "
"Spanish, this would be ``application/name_es``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are unsure about the language code to use, refer to the :ref:`list of "
"locale codes <doc_locales>`."
