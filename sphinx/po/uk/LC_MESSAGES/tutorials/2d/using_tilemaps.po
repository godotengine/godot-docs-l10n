"A tilemap is a grid of tiles used to create a game's layout. There are "
"several benefits to using :ref:`TileMap <class_TileMap>` nodes to design "
"your levels. First, they make it possible to draw the layout by \"painting\" "
"the tiles onto a grid, which is much faster than placing individual :ref:"
"`Sprite <class_Sprite>` nodes one by one. Second, they allow for much larger "
"levels because they are optimized for drawing large numbers of tiles. "
"Finally, you can add collision, occlusion, and navigation shapes to tiles, "
"adding additional functionality to the TileMap."
