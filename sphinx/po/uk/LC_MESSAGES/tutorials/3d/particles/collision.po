"Since GPU particles are processed entirely on the GPU, they don't have "
"access to the game's physical world. If you need particles to collide with "
"the environment, you have to set up particle collision nodes. There are four "
"of them: :ref:`class_GPUParticlesCollisionBox3D`, :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesCollisionSphere3D`, :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesCollisionSDF3D`, and :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D`."

"The ``Cull Mask`` property controls which particle systems are affected by a "
"collision node based on each system's :ref:`visibility layers "
"<class_VisualInstance3D>`. A particle system collides with a collision node "
"only if at least one of the system's visibility layers is enabled in the "
"collider's cull mask."

msgid "Height field collision in the node list"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Height field particle collision is very useful for large outdoor areas that "
"need to collide with particles. At runtime, the node creates a height field "
"from all the meshes within its bounds that match its cull mask. Particles "
"collide against the mesh that this height field represents. Since the height "
"field generation is done dynamically, it can follow the player camera around "
"and react to changes in the level. Different settings for the height field "
"density offer a wide range of performance adjustments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a height field collision node, add a new child node to your scene "
"and select ``GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D`` from the list of available "

"A height field collision node is shaped like a box. The ``Extents`` property "
"controls its size. Extents always measure half of the sides of its bounds, "
"so a value of ``(X=1.0,Y=1.0,Z=1.0)`` creates a box that is 2 meters wide on "
"each side. Anything outside of the node's extents is ignored for height "
"field creation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Resolution`` property controls how detailed the height field is. A "
"lower resolution performs faster at the cost of accuracy. If the height "
"field resolution is too low, it may look like particles penetrate level "
"geometry or get stuck in the air during collision events. They might also "
"ignore some smaller meshes completely."
msgstr ""

msgid "Height field resolutions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At low resolutions, height field collision misses some finer details (left)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Update Mode`` property controls when the height field is recreated "
"from the meshes within its bounds. Set it to ``When Moved`` to make it "
"refresh only when it moves. This performs well and is suited for static "
"scenes that don't change very often. If you need particles to collide with "
"dynamic objects that change position frequently, you can select ``Always`` "
"to refresh every frame. This comes with a cost to performance and should "
"only be used when necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's important to remember that when ``Update Mode`` is set to ``When "
"Moved``, it is the *height field node* whose movement triggers an update. "
"The height field is not updated when one of the meshes inside it moves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Follow Camera Enabled`` property makes the height field follow the "
"current camera when enabled. It will update whenever the camera moves. This "
"property can be used to make sure that there is always particle collision "
"around the player while not wasting performance on regions that are out of "
"sight or too far away."

"eli5_what_are_distance_fields_in_graphics>`_ that particles can collide "
"with. SDF collision is similar to height field collision in that it turns "
"multiple meshes within its bounds into a single collision volume for "
"particles. A major difference is that signed distance fields can represent "
"holes, tunnels and overhangs, which is impossible to do with height fields "
"alone. The performance overhead is larger compared to height fields, so "
"they're best suited for small-to-medium-sized environments."

"To create an SDF collision node, add a new child node to your scene and "
