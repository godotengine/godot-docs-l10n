msgid "Using the MeshDataTool"
msgstr "Використання вашого модуля GDNative"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`MeshDataTool <class_meshdatatool>` is not used to generate "
"geometry. But it is helpful for dynamically altering geometry, for example "
"if you want to write a script to tessellate, simplify, or deform meshes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The MeshDataTool is not as fast as altering arrays directly using ArrayMesh. "
"However, it provides more information and tools to work with meshes than the "
"ArrayMesh does. When the MeshDataTool is used, it calculates mesh data that "
"is not available in ArrayMeshes such as faces and edges, which are necessary "
"for certain mesh algorithms. If you do not need this extra information then "
"it may be better to use an ArrayMesh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"MeshDataTool can only be used on Meshes that use the PrimitiveType ``Mesh."
"PRIMITIVE_TRIANGLES``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As an example, let's walk through the process of deforming the mesh "
"generated in the :ref:`ArrayMesh tutorial <doc_arraymesh>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assume the mesh is stored in an ArrayMesh named ``mesh``. We then initialize "
"the MeshDataTool from ``mesh`` by calling ``create_from_surface()``. If "
"there is already data initialized in the MeshDataTool calling "
"``create_from_surface()`` will clear it for you. Alternatively, you can call "
"``clear()`` yourself before re-using the MeshDataTool"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``create_from_surface()`` uses the vertex arrays from the ArrayMesh to "
"calculate two additional arrays, one for edges and one for faces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An edge is a connection between any two vertices. Each edge in the edge "
"array contains a reference to the two vertices it is composed of, and up to "
"two faces that it is contained within."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A face is a triangle made up of three vertices and three corresponding "
"edges. Each face in the face array contains a reference to the three "
"triangles and three edges it is composed of."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The vertex array contains edges, faces, normals, color, tangent, uv, uv2, "
"bones, and weight information connected with each vertex."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To access information from these arrays you use a function of the form "
"``get_****()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What you choose to do with these functions is up to you. A common use case "
"is to iterate over all vertices and transform them in some way:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, ``commit_to_surface()`` adds a new surface to the ArrayMesh. So if "
"you are dynamically updating an existing ArrayMesh, first delete the "
"existing surface before adding a new one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Below is a complete example that creates a pulsing blob complete with new "
"normals and vertex colors."
