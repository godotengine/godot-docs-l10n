"The :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` node is the easiest way to make "
"HTTP requests in Godot. It is backed by the more low-level :ref:`HTTPClient "
"<class_HTTPClient>`, for which a tutorial is available :ref:`here "
"<doc_http_client_class>`."

"Of course, you can also set custom HTTP headers. These are given as a string "

"Keep in mind that you have to wait for a request to finish before sending "
