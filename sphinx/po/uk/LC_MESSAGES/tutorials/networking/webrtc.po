"One of Godot's great features is its ability to export to the HTML5/"

"This is a great opportunity for both demos and full games, but used to come "
"with some limitations. In the area of networking, browsers used to support "
"only HTTPRequests until recently, when first WebSocket and then WebRTC were "
"proposed as standards."

msgid ""
"When the WebSocket protocol was standardized in December 2011, it allowed "
"browsers to create stable and bidirectional connections to a WebSocket "
"server. The protocol is quite simple, but a very powerful tool to send push "
"notifications to browsers, and has been used to implement chats, turn-based "
"games, etc."

"WebSockets, though, still use a TCP connection, which is good for "
"reliability but not for latency, so not good for real-time applications like "
"VoIP and fast-paced games."

"For this reason, since 2010, Google started working on a new technology "
"called WebRTC, which later on, in 2017, became a W3C candidate "
"recommendation. WebRTC is a much more complex set of specifications, and "
"relies on many other technologies behind the scenes (ICE, DTLS, SDP) to "
"provide fast, real-time, and secure communication between two peers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/networking/webrtc.rst:25
msgid ""
"The idea is to find the fastest route between the two peers and establish "
"whenever possible a direct communication (i.e. try to avoid a relaying "
"server)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/networking/webrtc.rst:27
msgid ""
"However, this comes at a price, which is that some media information must be "
"exchanged between the two peers before the communication can start (in the "
"form of Session Description Protocol - SDP strings). This usually takes the "
"form of a so-called WebRTC Signaling Server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/networking/webrtc.rst:31
msgid ""
"Peers connect to a signaling server (for example a WebSocket server) and "
"send their media information. The server then relays this information to "
"other peers, allowing them to establish the desired direct communication. "
"Once this step is done, peers can disconnect from the signaling server and "
"keep the direct Peer-to-Peer (P2P) connection open."
