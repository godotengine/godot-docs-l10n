"Passthrough is a new feature introduced on the Meta Quest and added to the "
"OpenXR spec as a Meta extension. It is likely this implementation will be "
"implemented by other vendors where the hardware supports a passthrough mode "
"and promoted to core at some point."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that this feature is not guaranteed to be available. "
"Passthrough allows for the camera input on the headset to be used within the "
"headset so the user can see the real world. This allows us to implement an "
"AR-like experience in a VR headset."

msgid ""
"If you are using the ``first person controller`` scene, you can simply "
"enable passthrough by checking the **Start Passthrough** option on the "
"controller node:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you rather do this through code, you will first need to create an "
"instance of the ``OpenXRConfig`` object. You can do this the same way the "
"``first person controller`` does and assign the ``OpenXRConfig.gdns`` as the "
"script to a node, or you can instance it in code as shown below:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Viewport's **Transparent Bg** property must be enabled prior to starting "
"passthrough. The plugin will log a warning message if it detects an "
"incorrect configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A fix for a bug related to turning transparent background on/off is "
"scheduled for the Godot 3.4.3 release. If you wish to toggle passthrough in "
"your game, you will need to be on that version or newer."
