"Godot features an editor plugin system with numerous plugins developed by "

"The preferred way to find Godot plugins is to use the `Asset Library "
"<https://godotengine.org/asset-library/>`_. While it can be browsed online, "
"it's more convenient to use it directly from the editor. To do so, click the "
"**AssetLib** tab at the top of the editor:"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also find assets on code hosting websites such as GitHub."

"Some repositories describe themselves as \"plugins\" but may not actually be "
"*editor* plugins. This is especially the case for scripts that are intended "
"to be used in a running project. You don't need to enable such plugins to "
"use them. Download them and extract the files in your project folder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One way to distinguish editor plugins from non-editor plugins is to look for "
"a ``plugin.cfg`` file in the repository that hosts the plugin. If the "
"repository contains a ``plugin.cfg`` file in a folder placed in the ``addons/"
"`` folder, then it is an editor plugin."

"To install a plugin, download it as a ZIP archive. On the Asset Library, "
"this can be done using the **Download** button, either from the editor or "
"using the Web interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On GitHub, if a plugin has *tags* (versions) declared, go to the "
"**Releases** tab to download a stable release. This ensures you download a "
"version that was declared to be stable by its author."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On GitHub, if the plugin doesn't have any *tags* declared, use the "
"**Download ZIP** button to download a ZIP of the latest revision:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Extract the ZIP archive and move the ``addons/`` folder it contains into "
"your project folder. If your project already contains an ``addons/`` folder, "
"move the plugin's ``addons/`` folder into your project folder to merge the "
"new folder contents with the existing one. Your file manager may ask you "
"whether to write into the folder; answer **Yes**. No files will be "
"overwritten in the process."

"To enable the freshly installed plugin, open **Project > Project Settings** "
"at the top of the editor then go the **Plugins** tab. If the plugin was "
"packaged correctly, you should see it in the list of plugins. Click on the "
"**Enable** checkbox to enable the plugin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use the plugin immediately after enabling it; there's no need to "
"restart the editor. Likewise, disabling a plugin can be done without having "
"to restart the editor."
