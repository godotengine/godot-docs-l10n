msgid "Converting GLSL to Godot shaders"
msgstr "Створення сервера Godot"

msgid ""
"This document explains the differences between Godot's shading language and "
"GLSL and gives practical advice on how to migrate shaders from other "
"sources, such as Shadertoy and The Book of Shaders, into Godot shaders."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For detailed information on Godot's shading language, please refer to the :"
"ref:`Shading Language <doc_shading_language>` reference."
msgstr ""

msgid "GLSL"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot uses a shading language based on GLSL with the addition of a few "
"quality-of-life features. Accordingly, most features available in GLSL are "
"available in Godot's shading language."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shader programs"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In GLSL, each shader uses a separate program. You have one program for the "
"vertex shader and one for the fragment shader. In Godot, you have a single "
"shader that contains a ``vertex`` and/or a ``fragment`` function. If you "
"only choose to write one, Godot will supply the other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot allows uniform variables and functions to be shared by defining the "
"fragment and vertex shaders in one file. In GLSL, the vertex and fragment "
"programs cannot share variables except when varyings are used."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Vertex attributes"
msgstr "``x.attribute``"

msgid ""
"In GLSL, you can pass in per-vertex information using attributes and have "
"the flexibility to pass in as much or as little as you want. In Godot, you "
"have a set number of input attributes, including ``VERTEX`` (position), "
"``COLOR``, ``UV``, ``UV2``, ``NORMAL``. Each shaders' page in the shader "
"reference section of the documentation comes with a complete list of its "
"vertex attributes."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "gl_Position"
msgstr "Умова"

msgid ""
"``gl_Position`` receives the final position of a vertex specified in the "
"vertex shader. It is specified by the user in clip space. Typically, in "
"GLSL, the model space vertex position is passed in using a vertex attribute "
"called ``position`` and you handle the conversion from model space to clip "
"space manually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot, ``VERTEX`` specifies the vertex position in model space at the "
"beginning of the ``vertex`` function. Godot also handles the final "
"conversion to clip space after the user-defined ``vertex`` function is run. "
"If you want to skip the conversion from model to view space, you can set the "
"``render_mode`` to ``skip_vertex_transform``. If you want to skip all "
"transforms, set ``render_mode`` to ``skip_vertex_transform`` and set the "
"``PROJECTION_MATRIX`` to ``mat4(1.0)`` in order to nullify the final "
"transform from view space to clip space."
msgstr ""

msgid "Varyings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Varyings are a type of variable that can be passed from the vertex shader to "
"the fragment shader. In modern GLSL (3.0 and up), varyings are defined with "
"the ``in`` and ``out`` keywords. A variable going out of the vertex shader "
"is defined with ``out`` in the vertex shader and ``in`` inside the fragment "
"shader."
msgstr ""

msgid "Main"
msgstr "Основний"

msgid ""
"In GLSL, each shader program looks like a self-contained C-style program. "
"Accordingly, the main entry point is ``main``. If you are copying a vertex "
"shader, rename ``main`` to ``vertex`` and if you are copying a fragment "
"shader, rename ``main`` to ``fragment``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Macros"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ref:`Godot shader preprocessor<doc_shader_preprocessor>` supports the "
"following macros:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``#define`` / ``#undef``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``#if``, ``#elif``, ``#else``, ``#endif``, ``defined()``, ``#ifdef``, "
"``#ifndef``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``#include`` (only ``.gdshaderinc`` files and with a maximum depth of 25)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``#pragma disable_preprocessor``, which disables preprocessing for the rest "
"of the file"
msgstr ""

msgid "Variables"
msgstr "Змінні"

"not uniforms, so they are not editable from the main program."

"The main point of entry to a Shadertoy shader is the ``mainImage`` function. "
"``mainImage`` has two parameters, ``fragColor`` and ``fragCoord``, which "
"correspond to ``COLOR`` and ``FRAGCOORD`` in Godot, respectively. These "
"parameters are handled automatically in Godot, so you do not need to include "
"them as parameters yourself. Anything in the ``mainImage`` function should "
"be copied into the ``fragment`` function when porting to Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to make writing fragment shaders straightforward and easy, "
"Shadertoy handles passing a lot of helpful information from the main program "
"into the fragment shader for you. A few of these have no equivalents in "
"Godot because Godot has chosen not to make them available by default. This "
"is okay because Godot gives you the ability to make your own uniforms. For "
"variables whose equivalents are listed as \"Provide with Uniform\", users "
"are responsible for creating that uniform themselves. The description gives "
"the reader a hint about what they can pass in as a substitute."

"Book of Shaders provides a `page <https://thebookofshaders.com/04>`_ on "
