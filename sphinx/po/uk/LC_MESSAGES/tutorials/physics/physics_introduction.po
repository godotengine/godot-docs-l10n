"In game development, you often need to know when two objects in the game "
"intersect or come into contact. This is known as **collision detection**. "
"When a collision is detected, you typically want something to happen. This "
"is known as **collision response**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot offers a number of collision objects in 2D and 3D to provide both "
"collision detection and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your "
"project can be confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if "
"you understand how each works and what their pros and cons are."

"Godot offers four kinds of collision objects which all extend :ref:"
"`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`. The last three listed below "
"are physics bodies and additionally extend :ref:`PhysicsBody2D "
"<class_PhysicsBody2D>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Area2D`` nodes provide **detection** and **influence**. They can detect "
"when objects overlap and can emit signals when bodies enter or exit. An "
"``Area2D`` can also be used to override physics properties, such as gravity "
"or damping, in a defined area."

msgid ""
"A static body is one that is not moved by the physics engine. It "
"participates in collision detection, but does not move in response to the "
"collision. They are most often used for objects that are part of the "
"environment or that do not need to have any dynamic behavior."

msgid "Physics material"
msgstr "Фізичні властивості"

msgid ""
"Static bodies and rigid bodies can be configured to use a :ref:"
"`PhysicsMaterial <class_PhysicsMaterial>`. This allows adjusting the "
"friction and bounce of an object, and set if it's absorbent and/or rough."
msgstr ""

msgid "Collision shapes"
msgstr "Форми зіткнень"

msgid ""
"A physics body can hold any number of :ref:`Shape2D <class_Shape2D>` objects "
"as children. These shapes are used to define the object's collision bounds "
"and to detect contact with other objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to detect collisions, at least one ``Shape2D`` must be assigned to "
"the object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The most common way to assign a shape is by adding a :ref:`CollisionShape2D "
"<class_CollisionShape2D>` or :ref:`CollisionPolygon2D "
"<class_CollisionPolygon2D>` as a child of the object. These nodes allow you "
"to draw the shape directly in the editor workspace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Be careful to never scale your collision shapes in the editor. The \"Scale\" "
"property in the Inspector should remain ``(1, 1)``. When changing the size "
"of the collision shape, you should always use the size handles, **not** the "
"``Node2D`` scale handles. Scaling a shape can result in unexpected collision "
"behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid "Physics process callback"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The physics engine runs at a fixed rate (a default of 60 iterations per "
"second). This rate is typically different from the frame rate which "
"fluctuates based on what is rendered and available resources."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is important that all physics related code runs at this fixed rate. "
"Therefore Godot differentiates :ref:`between physics and idle processing "
"<doc_idle_and_physics_processing>`. Code that runs each frame is called idle "
"processing and code that runs on each physics tick is called physics "
"processing. Godot provides two different callbacks, one for each of those "
"processing rates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The physics callback, :ref:`Node._physics_process() "
"<class_Node_private_method__physics_process>`, is called before each physics "
"step. Any code that needs to access a body's properties should be run in "
"here. This method will be passed a ``delta`` parameter, which is a floating-"
"point number equal to the time passed in *seconds* since the last step. When "
"using the default 60 Hz physics update rate, it will typically be equal to "
"``0.01666...`` (but not always, see below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's recommended to always use the ``delta`` parameter when relevant in your "
"physics calculations, so that the game behaves correctly if you change the "
"physics update rate or if the player's device can't keep up."

msgid "Collision layers and masks"
msgstr "Зіткнення"

msgid ""
"One of the most powerful, but frequently misunderstood, collision features "
"is the collision layer system. This system allows you to build up complex "
"interactions between a variety of objects. The key concepts are **layers** "
"and **masks**. Each ``CollisionObject2D`` has 32 different physics layers it "
"can interact with."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's look at each of the properties in turn:"

msgid "collision_layer"

msgid ""
"This describes the layers that the object appears **in**. By default, all "
"bodies are on layer ``1``."
msgstr ""

msgid "collision_mask"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This describes what layers the body will **scan** for collisions. If an "
"object isn't in one of the mask layers, the body will ignore it. By default, "
"all bodies scan layer ``1``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These properties can be configured via code, or by editing them in the "
"Inspector."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keeping track of what you're using each layer for can be difficult, so you "
"may find it useful to assign names to the layers you're using. Names can be "
"assigned in Project Settings -> Layer Names."

msgid ""
"You have four node types in your game: Walls, Player, Enemy, and Coin. Both "
"Player and Enemy should collide with Walls. The Player node should detect "
"collisions with both Enemy and Coin, but Enemy and Coin should ignore each "
"other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Start by naming layers 1-4 \"walls\", \"player\", \"enemies\", and \"coins\" "
"and place each node type in its respective layer using the \"Layer\" "
"property. Then set each node's \"Mask\" property by selecting the layers it "
"should interact with. For example, the Player's settings would look like "
"this:"

"In function calls, layers are specified as a bitmask. Where a function "

"defined area."

msgid "StaticBody2D"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A static body is one that is not moved by the physics engine. It "
"participates in collision detection, but does not move in response to the "
"collision. However, it can impart motion or rotation to a colliding body "
"**as if** it were moving, using its ``constant_linear_velocity`` and "
"``constant_angular_velocity`` properties."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``StaticBody2D`` nodes are most often used for objects that are part of the "
"environment or that do not need to have any dynamic behavior."

msgid "RigidBody2D"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the node that implements simulated 2D physics. You do not control a :"
"ref:`RigidBody2D <class_RigidBody2D>` directly. Instead, you apply forces to "
"it and the physics engine calculates the resulting movement, including "
"collisions with other bodies, and collision responses, such as bouncing, "
"rotating, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can modify a rigid body's behavior via properties such as \"Mass\", "
"\"Friction\", or \"Bounce\", which can be set in the Inspector."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The body's behavior is also affected by the world's properties, as set in "
"`Project Settings -> Physics`, or by entering an :ref:`Area2D "
"<class_Area2D>` that is overriding the global physics properties."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a rigid body is at rest and hasn't moved for a while, it goes to sleep. "
"A sleeping body acts like a static body, and its forces are not calculated "
"by the physics engine. The body will wake up when forces are applied, either "
"by a collision or via code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using RigidBody2D"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of the benefits of using a rigid body is that a lot of behavior can be "
"had \"for free\" without writing any code. For example, if you were making "
"an \"Angry Birds\"-style game with falling blocks, you would only need to "
"create RigidBody2Ds and adjust their properties. Stacking, falling, and "
"bouncing would automatically be calculated by the physics engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, if you do wish to have some control over the body, you should take "
"care - altering the ``position``, ``linear_velocity``, or other physics "
"properties of a rigid body can result in unexpected behavior. If you need to "
"alter any of the physics-related properties, you should use the :ref:"
"`_integrate_forces() <class_RigidBody2D_private_method__integrate_forces>` "
"callback instead of ``_physics_process()``. In this callback, you have "
"access to the body's :ref:`PhysicsDirectBodyState2D "
"<class_PhysicsDirectBodyState2D>`, which allows for safely changing "
"properties and synchronizing them with the physics engine."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, here is the code for an \"Asteroids\" style spaceship:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we are not setting the ``linear_velocity`` or ``angular_velocity`` "
"properties directly, but rather applying forces (``thrust`` and ``torque``) "
"to the body and letting the physics engine calculate the resulting movement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a rigid body goes to sleep, the ``_integrate_forces()`` function will "
"not be called. To override this behavior, you will need to keep the body "
"awake by creating a collision, applying a force to it, or by disabling the :"
"ref:`can_sleep <class_RigidBody2D_property_can_sleep>` property. Be aware "
"that this can have a negative effect on performance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Contact reporting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, rigid bodies do not keep track of contacts, because this can "
"require a huge amount of memory if many bodies are in the scene. To enable "
"contact reporting, set the :ref:`max_contacts_reported "
"<class_RigidBody2D_property_max_contacts_reported>` property to a non-zero "
"value. The contacts can then be obtained via :ref:`PhysicsDirectBodyState2D."
"get_contact_count() "
"<class_PhysicsDirectBodyState2D_method_get_contact_count>` and related "
"functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Contact monitoring via signals can be enabled via the :ref:`contact_monitor "
"<class_RigidBody2D_property_contact_monitor>` property. See :ref:"
"`RigidBody2D <class_RigidBody2D>` for the list of available signals."
msgstr ""

msgid "CharacterBody2D"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`CharacterBody2D <class_CharacterBody2D>` bodies detect collisions with "
"other bodies, but are not affected by physics properties like gravity or "
"friction. Instead, they must be controlled by the user via code. The physics "
"engine will not move a character body."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When moving a character body, you should not set its ``position`` directly. "
"Instead, you use the ``move_and_collide()`` or ``move_and_slide()`` methods. "
"These methods move the body along a given vector, and it will instantly stop "
"if a collision is detected with another body. After the body has collided, "
"any collision response must be coded manually."

msgid "Character collision response"
msgstr "Видимі контури зіткнень"

msgid ""
"After a collision, you may want the body to bounce, to slide along a wall, "
"or to alter the properties of the object it hit. The way you handle "
"collision response depends on which method you used to move the "
"CharacterBody2D."
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`move_and_collide <class_PhysicsBody2D_method_move_and_collide>`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using ``move_and_collide()``, the function returns a :ref:"
"`KinematicCollision2D <class_KinematicCollision2D>` object, which contains "
"information about the collision and the colliding body. You can use this "
"information to determine the response."

"For example, if you want to find the point in space where the collision "
"occurred:"

"Sliding is a common collision response; imagine a player moving along walls "
"in a top-down game or running up and down slopes in a platformer. While it's "
"possible to code this response yourself after using ``move_and_collide()``, "
"``move_and_slide()`` provides a convenient way to implement sliding movement "
"without writing much code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``move_and_slide()`` automatically includes the timestep in its calculation, "
