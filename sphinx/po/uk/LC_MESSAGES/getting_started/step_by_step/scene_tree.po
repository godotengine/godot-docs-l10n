"In previous tutorials, everything revolved around the concept of nodes. "
"Scenes are collections of nodes. They become active once they enter the "
"*scene tree*."

"The way Godot works internally is as follows. There is the :ref:`OS "
"<class_OS>` class, which is the only instance that runs at the beginning. "
"Afterwards, all drivers, servers, scripting languages, scene system, etc are "
"loaded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.rst:21
msgid ""
"When initialization is complete, :ref:`OS <class_OS>` needs to be supplied "
"a :ref:`MainLoop <class_MainLoop>` to run. Up to this point, all this is "
"internals working (you can check main/main.cpp file in the source code if "
"you are ever interested to see how this works internally)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The user program, or game, starts in the MainLoop. This class has a few "
"methods, for initialization, idle (frame-synchronized callback), fixed "
"(physics-synchronized callback), and input. Again, this is low level and "
"when making games in Godot, writing your own MainLoop seldom makes sense."

"One of the ways to explain how Godot works is that it's a high level game "

"The scene system is the game engine, while the :ref:`OS <class_OS>` and "

"The scene system provides its own main loop to OS, :ref:`SceneTree "
"<class_SceneTree>`. This is automatically instanced and set when running a "
"scene, no need to do any extra work."

"It contains the root :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`, to which a scene is "

"This node contains the main viewport. Anything that is a child of a :ref:"
