msgid "Making HTTP requests"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` node is the easiest way to make "
"HTTP requests in Godot. It is backed by the more low-level :ref:`HTTPClient "
"<class_HTTPClient>`, for which a tutorial is available :ref:`here "
"<doc_http_client_class>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the sake of this example, we will create a simple UI with a button, that "
"when pressed will start the HTTP request to the specified URL."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the ``INTERNET`` permission "
"in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click "
"deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by "
"Android."
msgstr ""

msgid "Preparing scene"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new empty scene, add a CanvasLayer as the root node and add a "
"script to it. Then add two child nodes to it: a Button and an HTTPRequest "
"node. You will need to connect the following signals to the CanvasLayer "
"script:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Button.pressed: When the button is pressed, we will start the request."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"HTTPRequest.request_completed: When the request is completed, we will get "
"the requested data as an argument."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scripting"
msgstr "Написание скриптов"

msgid ""
"Below is all the code we need to make it work. The URL points to an online "
"API mocker; it returns a pre-defined JSON string, which we will then parse "
"to get access to the data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With this, you should see ``(hello:world)`` printed on the console; hello "
"being a key, and world being a value, both of them strings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more information on parsing JSON, see the class references for :ref:"
"`JSON <class_JSON>` and :ref:`JSONParseResult <class_JSONParseResult>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that you may want to check whether the ``result`` equals "
"``RESULT_SUCCESS`` and whether a JSON parsing error occurred, see the JSON "
"class reference and :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` for more."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Of course, you can also set custom HTTP headers. These are given as a string "
"array, with each string containing a header in the format ``\"header: "
"value\"``. For example, to set a custom user agent (the HTTP ``user-agent`` "
"header) you could use the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please note that, for SSL/TLS encryption and thus HTTPS URLs to work, you "
"may need to take some steps as described :ref:`here <doc_ssl_certificates>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, when calling APIs using authorization, be aware that someone might "
"analyse and decompile your released application and thus may gain access to "
"any embedded authorization information like tokens, usernames or passwords. "
"That means it is usually not a good idea to embed things such as database "
"access credentials inside your game. Avoid providing information useful to "
"an attacker whenever possible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sending data to server"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Until now, we have limited ourselves to requesting data from a server. But "
"what if you need to send data to the server? Here is a common way of doing "
"it:"
msgstr ""
"До сих пор мы ограничивались запросом данных с сервера. Но что, если вам "
"нужно отправить данные на сервер? Вот общий способ сделать это:"

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that you have to wait for a request to finish before sending "
"another one. Making multiple request at once requires you to have one node "
"per request. A common strategy is to create and delete HTTPRequest nodes at "
"runtime as necessary."
