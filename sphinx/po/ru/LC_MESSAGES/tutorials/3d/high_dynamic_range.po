"Normally, an artist does all the 3D modelling, then all the texturing, looks "
"at their awesome looking model in the 3D DCC and says \"looks fantastic, "
"ready for integration!\" then goes into the game, lighting is setup and the "
"game runs."

"So at what point does all this \"HDR\" business come into play? To "

"Your display outputs linear light ratios from some maximum to some minimum "
"intensity. Modern game engines perform complex math on linear light values "
"in their respective scenes. So what's the problem?"

"The display has a limited range of intensity, depending on the display type. "
"The game engine renders to an unlimited range of intensity values, however. "
"While \"maximum intensity\" means something to an sRGB display, it has no "
"bearing in the game engine; there is only a potentially infinitely wide "
"range of intensity values generated per frame of rendering."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/high_dynamic_range.rst:27
msgid ""
"This means that some transformation of the scene light intensity, also known "
"as *scene-referred* light ratios, need to be transformed and mapped to fit "
"within the particular output range of the chosen display. This can be most "
"easily understood if we consider virtually photographing our game engine "
"scene through a virtual camera. Here, our virtual camera would apply a "
"particular camera rendering transform to the scene data, and the output "
"would be ready for display on a particular display type."

"Almost all displays require a nonlinear encoding for the code values sent to "
"them. The display in turn, using its unique transfer characteristic, "
"\"decodes\" the code value into linear light ratios of output, and projects "
"the ratios out of the uniquely colored lights at each reddish, greenish, and "
"blueish emission site."

"For a majority of computer displays, the specifications of the display are "
"outlined in accordance with IEC 61966-2-1, also known as the 1996 sRGB "
"specification. This specification outlines how an sRGB display is to behave, "
"including the color of the lights in the LED pixels as well as the transfer "
"characteristics of the input (OETF) and output (EOTF)."

"Not all displays use the same OETF and EOTF as a computer display. For "

"currently only supports sRGB displays."

"The mathematics of a scene-referred model require that we multiply the scene "
"by different values to adjust the intensities and exposure to different "
"light ranges. The transfer function of the display can't appropriately "
"render the wider dynamic range of the game engine's scene output using the "
"simple transfer function of the display. A more complex approach to encoding "
"is required."

"Working in scene-linear sRGB is not as simple as just pressing a switch. "
"First, imported image assets must be converted to linear light ratios on "
"import. Even when linearized, those assets may not be perfectly well-suited "

"This is the easiest method of using sRGB assets, but it's not the most "
"ideal. One issue with this is loss of quality. Using 8 bits per channel to "
"represent linear light ratios is not sufficient to quantize the values "
"correctly. These textures may also be compressed later, which can exacerbate "
