msgid "Putting all the ideas together, here is an example scene tree:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We have used a :ref:`RoomGroup<class_RoomGroup>` to denote an outside area."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ref:`MeshInstance<class_MeshInstance>`\\ s inside the :ref:"
"`Room<class_Room>`\\ s are either ``STATIC`` or ``DYNAMIC``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We have created a :ref:`Spatial<class_Spatial>` (I decided to call it "
"'Freeform', but you could use any name) under which to place ``STATIC`` and "
"``DYNAMIC`` objects that will be autoplaced in rooms (Freeform is inside the "
"``roomlist``, but *not* inside a room.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The player and the monsters are on branches *OUTSIDE* the ``roomlist``."

"The player and monster meshes have portal mode ``ROAMING`` so they can be in "

msgid "Creating room systems in Blender (or other modeling tools)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although you can create your room system entirely within the editor, you can "
"also build rooms and portals within your modeling tool. There is one small "
"snag - modeling tools such as Blender have no knowledge of Room, RoomGroup "
"and Portal nodes. In order to work around this we use a series of naming "
"conventions. The first time Godot encounters these specially named nodes, it "
"will convert them into Rooms, RoomGroups and Portals."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Postfix convention"
msgstr "Соглашения о форматировании"

msgid "``-room`` becomes a :ref:`Room<class_Room>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "``-roomgroup`` becomes a :ref:`RoomGroup<class_RoomGroup>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "``-portal`` becomes a :ref:`Portal<class_Portal>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "``-bound`` becomes a manual bound."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rooms and RoomGroups should be created as Empties within Blender. Any mesh "
"children of the ``-room`` Empty will thus be placed in the Room during "
"conversion in Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example:"
msgstr "Например:"

msgid "``kitchen-room`` - create a Room called \"kitchen\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "``outside-roomgroup`` - create a RoomGroup called \"outside\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "``kitchen-portal`` - create a Portal leading to the \"kitchen\" Room."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Portals"
msgstr "Порты"

msgid ""
"Portals are different from Rooms. In Portals, we need to specify the "
"geometry of the Portal in our modelling tool, in addition to just the name. "
"To do this your \"portal-to-be\" should be created as a Mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Portal meshes have some restrictions to work properly. They must be convex, "
"and the polygon points should be in the same plane. The accuracy to the "
"plane does not have to be exact, as Godot will automatically average the "
"direction of the portal plane. Once converted to a :ref:"
"`Portal<class_Portal>` node, the snapping to the portal plane is enforced, "
"and the vertices are specified (and editable) as 2D coordinates in the "
"inspector, rather than 3D points."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The portal's naming is quite important. You can either name the portal ``-"
"portal`` which will attempt to autolink the Portal in Godot, or you can use "
"the name of the Room you wish to link the Portal to as a prefix."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wildcard"
msgstr "Шаблон подстановки"

msgid ""
"In most cases, this can be done using a name such as ``kitchen-portal``. "
"However, there is one problem. Blender and Godot do not deal well when you "
"have multiple objects with the same name. What happens when we want more "
"than one Portal to lead to the kitchen?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The workaround is the use of a *wildcard* character, ``*``. When Godot reads "
"the wildcard, it will ignore anything placed after it in the name."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "This means we can use the following portal names:"
msgstr "Это всплывающее окно имеет следующие свойства:"

msgid "``kitchen*1-portal`` - creates a Portal leading to the \"kitchen\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``kitchen*2-portal`` - also creates a Portal leading to the \"kitchen\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "``kitchen*anything_you_want_here-portal`` - also works."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wildcards work on all of the nodes which use these naming conventions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual bounds"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Manual bounds are a way of explicitly setting the convex hull for a room, "
"and are used if they are present as children of a room in the scene tree. "
"Aside from the postfix, the naming is unimportant. They should be meshes (i."
"e. MeshInstance in Godot). Bear in mind they will be converted to convex "
"hulls during the conversion process, so they don't have to be perfect."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once used during conversion, they will be converted to the ``IGNORE`` "
"**Portal Mode** and won't be shown. You can alternatively use **Generate "
"Points** within the editor to convert these to a set of points stored in the "
"room, and delete the original ``-bound`` MeshInstance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Portal point editing"
msgstr "Подробности по экспорту"

msgid ""
"Portals are defined by a combination of the transform of the portal node, "
"and by a set of points which form the corners."
msgstr ""

msgid "The default portal has 4 corners as shown in the inspector:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can edit these points in the gizmo or inspector to make a better match "
"to the opening in your game level. It's generally better to keep the number "
"of points as low as possible for the efficiency of the system. For example, "
"it's better to risk rendering a little too much than to spend the time "
"culling objects at 20 different edges."
msgstr ""

msgid "Room point editing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You also have the option to manually edit the points used to define the "
"convex hull of a room. These points are not present by default. You would "
"typically create them by pressing the **Generate Points** button in the "
"editor toolbar when a room is selected. This will transfer the auto bound "
"from the geometry (or manual ``-bound`` mesh) into the inspector. Once there "
"are points in the inspector, they will be used and override any other "
"method. So if you wish to revert your manual editing, delete all the room's "
"points."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Manually editing points can be useful in some situations, especially where "
"the auto-bound doesn't *quite* get the right result you want. It is usually "
"a good idea to use a lot of **Simplification** in the inspector for the Room "
"before generating the points. Be aware though that by default, the "
"**Simplification** value will be inherited from the RoomManager."

msgid "Debug Sprawl"
msgstr "Отладчик"

msgid ""
"This mode will only display meshes that are sprawling through portals from "
"the current camera room. Large statics that cross portals are usually the "
"ones you want to sprawl. Typical examples might be terrain mesh areas, or "
"large floor or ceiling meshes. You usually don't want things like door "
"frames to sprawl to the adjacent room - that is what fine tuning the "
"**Portal Margin** is for."

msgid "Merge Meshes"
msgstr "Меши"

msgid ""
"To keep drawcalls to a minimum, the system offers the option to "
"automatically merge similar ``STATIC`` meshes within a room (also known as "
"*static batching*). This can increase performance in many cases. The culling "
"accuracy is reduced, but as a room is a fairly logical unit for culling, "
"this trade off usually works in your favor."
msgstr ""

msgid "Plane Simplification"
msgstr "Пакетная сериализация"

msgid ""
"In some cases, the convex hulls automatically generated for rooms may "
"contain a very large number of planes, particularly if you use curved "
"surfaces. This is not ideal because it slows down the system. This option "
"can optionally simplify hulls. The degree of simplification can be selected "
"by the user, between ``0`` (no simplification) and ``1`` (maximum "
"simplification). You can also override this value in individual rooms."

"Portals can be turned on and off at runtime. This is especially useful if "
"you have doors that can open and close."

msgid "Two Way"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Portals can either be two-way or one-way. The default two-way portals are "
"quicker to set up in most circumstances, but one-way portals can be useful "
"in some cases. For example, you can use one-way portals to create windows "
"that can be seen out of, but not seen into. This can help performance when "
"viewing buildings from outdoors."

msgid "Particle Systems"
msgstr "Системы частиц (2D)"

msgid ""
"Be aware that when placing ``STATIC`` particle systems, the AABB on "
"conversion may have zero size. This means the particle system may be "
"unexpectedly culled early. To prevent this, either set the particle system "
"``portal mode`` to ``DYNAMIC``, or alternatively, add an **Extra Cull "
"Margin** to the particle system in the Geometry Inspector."

msgid "Multimeshes"
