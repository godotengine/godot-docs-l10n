"Baked lightmaps are an alternative workflow for adding indirect (or baked) "
"lighting to a scene. Unlike the :ref:`doc_gi_probes` approach, baked "
"lightmaps work fine on low-end PCs and mobile devices, as they consume "
"almost no resources at run-time."

"Unlike ``GIProbe``\\ s, Baked Lightmaps are completely static. Once baked, "
"they can't be modified at all. They also don't provide the scene with "
"reflections, so using :ref:`doc_reflection_probes` together with it on "
"interiors (or using a Sky on exteriors) is a requirement to get good quality."

"In the end, deciding which indirect lighting approach is better depends on "

"Here are some comparisons of how Baked Lightmaps vs. GIProbe look. Notice "
"that lightmaps are more accurate, but also suffer from the fact that "
"lighting is on an unwrapped texture, so transitions and resolution may not "
"be that good. GIProbe looks less accurate (as it's an approximation), but "

"One option is to do it from your favorite 3D app. This approach is generally "
