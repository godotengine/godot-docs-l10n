msgid "A mathematical expression such as ``(2 + 4) * 16/4.0``."

msgid "A built-in method call like ``deg_to_rad(90)``."

"``base_instance`` is set to a value other than ``null`` when calling :ref:"

msgid "Setting a base instance for the expression"
msgstr "Создание сервера Godot"

msgid ""
"By default, an expression has a base instance of ``null``. This means the "
"expression has no base instance associated to it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When calling :ref:`Expression.execute() <class_Expression_method_execute>`, "
"you can set the value of the ``base_instance`` parameter to a specific "
"object instance such as ``self``, another script instance or even a "
"singleton::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Associating a base instance allows doing the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Reference the instance's constants (``const``) in the expression."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reference the instance's member variables (``var``) in the expression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Call methods defined in the instance and use their return values in the "
"expression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting a base instance to a value other than ``null`` allows referencing "
"constants, member variables, and calling all methods defined in the script "
"attached to the instance. Allowing users to enter expressions may allow "
"cheating in your game, or may even introduce security vulnerabilities if you "
"allow arbitrary clients to run expressions on other players' devices."

"The same parameters and return types are available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, unlike GDScript, parameters are **always required** even if they're "
"specified as being optional in the class reference. In contrast, this "
"restriction on arguments doesn't apply to user-made functions when you bind "
"a base instance to the expression."
