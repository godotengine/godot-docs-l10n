msgid "First, let's go through all the class variables in the script:"
msgstr "Рассмотрим все переменные класса:"

msgid ""
"``destroyed``: A variable to track whether the sphere target has been "
"destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``destroyed_timer``: A variable to track how long the sphere target has been "
"destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``DESTROY_WAIT_TIME``: A constant to define the length of time the target "
"can be destroyed for before it frees/deletes itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``health``: A variable to store the amount of health the sphere target has."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``RIGID_BODY_TARGET``: A constant to hold the scene of the destroyed sphere "
"target."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Feel free to check out the ``RIGID_BODY_TARGET`` scene. It is just a bunch "
"of :ref:`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` nodes and a broken sphere model."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We'll be instancing this scene so when the target is destroyed, it looks "
"like it broke into a bunch of pieces."
msgstr ""

msgid "``_ready`` function step-by-step explanation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All the ``_ready`` function does is that it stops the ``_physics_process`` "
"from being called by calling ``set_physics_process`` and passing ``false``. "
"The reason we do this is because all the code in ``_physics_process`` is for "
"destroying this node when enough time has passed, which we only want to do "
"when the target has been destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid "``_physics_process`` function step-by-step explanation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First this function adds time, ``delta``, to the ``destroyed_timer`` "
"variable. It then checks to see if ``destroyed_timer`` is greater than or "
"equal to ``DESTROY_WAIT_TIME``. If ``destroyed_timer`` is greater than or "
"equal to ``DESTROY_WAIT_TIME``, then the sphere target frees/deletes itself "
"by calling the ``queue_free`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid "``damage`` function step-by-step explanation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``damage`` function will be called by the special :ref:`RigidBody "
"<class_RigidBody>` nodes, which will pass the amount of damage done to the "
"target, which is a function argument variable called ``damage``. The "
"``damage`` variable will hold the amount of damage the special :ref:"
"`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` node did to the sphere target."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First this function checks to make sure the target is not already destroyed "
"by checking if the ``destroyed`` variable is equal to ``true``. If "
"``destroyed`` is equal to ``true``, then the function calls ``return`` so "
"none of the other code is called. This is just a safety check so that if two "
"things damage the target at exactly the same time, the target cannot be "
"destroyed twice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next the function removes the amount of damage taken, ``damage``, from the "
"target's health, ``health``. If then checks to see if ``health`` is equal to "
"zero or less, meaning that the target has just been destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the target has just been destroyed, then we disable the :ref:"
"`CollisionShape <class_CollisionShape>` by setting it's ``disabled`` "
"property to ``true``. We then make the ``Sphere_Target`` :ref:`MeshInstance "
"<class_MeshInstance>` invisible by setting the ``visible`` property to "
"``false``. We do this so the target can no longer effect the physics world "
"and so the non-broken target mesh is not visible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After this the function then instances the ``RIGID_BODY_TARGET`` scene and "
"adds it as a child of the target. It then sets the ``global_transform`` of "
"the newly instanced scene, called ``clone``, to the ``global_transform`` of "
"the non-broken target. This makes it where the broken target starts at the "
"same position as the non-broken target with the same rotation and scale."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then the function sets the ``destroyed`` variable to ``true`` so the target "
"knows it has been destroyed and calls the ``set_physics_process`` function "
"and passes ``true``. This will start executing the code in "
"``_physics_process`` so that after ``DESTROY_WAIT_TIME`` seconds have "
"passed, the sphere target will free/destroy itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function then gets the :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer3D "
"<class_AudioStreamPlayer3D>` node and calls the ``play`` function so it "
"plays its sound."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, the ``remove_sphere`` function is called in ``Game.gd``. To get "
"``Game.gd``, the code uses the scene tree and works its way from the root of "
"the scene tree to the root of the ``Game.tscn`` scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding the ``remove_sphere`` function to ``Game.gd``"

"``remove_sphere``, that we have not defined yet. Open up ``Game.gd`` and add "
"the following additional class variables:"

"``spheres_left``: The amount of sphere targets left in the world. In the "
"provided ``Game`` scene, there are ``10`` spheres, so that is the initial "
"value."

"``sphere_ui``: A reference to the sphere UI. We will use this later in the "

"Add the following code to ``Game.gd``:"

msgid "Let's go through what this function does real quick:"

msgid ""
"First, it removes one from the ``spheres_left`` variable. It then checks to "
"see if the ``sphere_ui`` variable is not equal to ``null``, and if it is not "
"equal to ``null`` it calls the ``update_ui`` function on ``sphere_ui``, "
"passing in the number of spheres as an argument to the function."
msgstr ""

msgid "We will add the code for ``sphere_ui`` later in this tutorial!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now the ``Sphere_Target`` is ready to be used, but we don't have any way to "
