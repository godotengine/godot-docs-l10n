"While it is possible to compile for iOS on a Linux environment, Apple is "
"very restrictive about the tools to be used (especially hardware-wise), "
"allowing pretty much only their products to be used for development. So this "
"is **not official**. However, in 2010 Apple said they relaxed some of the "
"`App Store review guidelines <https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/"
"guidelines/>`__ to allow any tool to be used, as long as the resulting "
"binary does not download any code, which means it should be OK to use the "
"procedure described here and cross-compiling the binary."

"Хотя компиляция для iOS возможна в среде Linux, Apple очень ограничивает "
"использование инструментов (особенно аппаратных), позволяя использовать для "
"разработки практически только свои продукты. Так что это **не официальный**. "
"Однако, в заявлении `от Apple в 2010 году <http://www.apple.com/pr/"
"library/2010/09/09Statement-by-Apple-on-App-Store-Review-Guidelines.html>`__ "
"говорится, что они смягчили некоторые правила `проверки App Store <https://"
"developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/>`__, чтобы разрешить "
"использование любых инструментов, при условии, что полученный бинарник не "
"загружает никакого кода, что означает, что можно использовать описанную "
"здесь процедуру и кросс-компиляцию бинарника."
