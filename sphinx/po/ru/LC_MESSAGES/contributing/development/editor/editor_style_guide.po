msgstr "Система предупреждений"

msgid ""
"**Write messages (errors, warnings, ...) as full sentences.** They should "
"start with an uppercase letter and end with a period."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Try to keep sentences short.** This makes it more likely that their "
"translations will be short as well, which is a good thing to avoid UI bugs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Use contractions.** For example, use \"isn't\" instead of \"is not\". An "
"exception to this rule can be made when you specifically want to emphasize "
"one of the contraction's words."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Use double quotes in messages** (``\"\"``) instead of single quotes "
"(``''``). Double quotes should be used to quote user input, file paths and "
"possibly other things depending on the context."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Try to follow the :ref:`doc_docs_writing_guidelines` in addition to the "
"guidelines outlined above."

msgid "Inspector sections"
msgstr ":ref:`doc_inspector_plugins`"

msgid ""
"In general, don't create sections that contain less than 3 items. Sections "
"that contain few items make it difficult to navigate the inspector, while "
"missing the benefits of using sections such as folding."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are some valid exceptions for this, such as material features in :ref:"
"`class_StandardMaterial3D`."

msgid "This advice also applies to the Project Settings and Editor Settings."

msgid "Inspector performance hints"
msgstr ":ref:`doc_inspector_plugins`"

msgid ""
"Enum properties that noticeably impact performance should have a performance "
"hint associated. The hint should refer to the *absolute* performance impact, "
"rather than being relative to the other options provided in the enum. Here "
"are some examples taken from the Godot editor:"

"For consistency, try to stick to the terms below (from fastest to slowest):"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Fastest, Faster, Fast, Average, Slow, Slower, Slowest*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Their usage doesn't have to be contiguous. For example, you can use only "
"\"Fast\" and \"Slow\" from the list above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're adding a new enum, its values should be ordered from the fastest "
"option to the slowest option."

msgid ""
"Consider adding tooltips whenever the action performed by a button or menu "
"action isn't obvious. You can also provide additional context or highlight "
"caveats in the tooltip."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can do this by calling ``set_tooltip(TTR(\"Text here.\"))`` on the "
"Control-based node in question. If the tooltip is particularly long (more "
"than ~80 characters), wrap it over several lines by adding line breaks using "
"``\\n``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tooltips should follow the writing style described above. In addition to "
"this, use indicative mood instead of imperative mood:"
