"When a new class is created and exposed to scripting, the editor's interface "
"will display it with a default icon representing the base class it inherits "
"from. In most cases, it's still recommended to create icons for new classes "
"to improve the user experience."

"To create new icons, you first need a vector graphics editor installed. For "
"instance, you can use the open source `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`_ "
"editor."

msgid "Clone the ``godot`` repository containing all the editor icons:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The icons must be created in a vector graphics editor in SVG format. There "
"are two main requirements to follow:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Icons must be 16×16. In Inkscape, you can configure the document size in "
"**File > Document Properties**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Lines should be snapped to pixels whenever possible to remain crisp at lower "
"DPI. You can create a 16×16 grid in Inkscape to make this easier."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you're satisfied with the icon's design, save the icon in the cloned "
"repository's ``editor/icons`` folder. The icon name should match the "
"intended name in a case-sensitive manner. For example, to create an icon for "
"CPUParticles2D, name the file ``CPUParticles2D.svg``."

msgid "Color conversion for light editor themes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the user has configured their editor to use a light theme, Godot will "
"convert the icon's colors based on a `set of predefined color mappings "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/4.0.2-stable/editor/editor_themes."
"cpp#L60-L160>`__. This is to ensure the icon always displays with a "
"sufficient contrast rate. Try to restrict your icon's color palette to "
"colors found in the list above. Otherwise, your icon may become difficult to "
"read on a light background."

msgid "Icon optimization"
msgstr "Анимация"

msgid ""
"Because the editor renders SVGs once at load time, they need to be small in "
"size so they can be efficiently parsed. Editor icons must be first optimized "
"before being added to the engine, to do so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Install `svgcleaner <https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgcleaner>`__ by "
"downloading a binary from its `Releases tab <https://github.com/RazrFalcon/"
"svgcleaner/releases/latest>`__ and placing it into a location in your "
"``PATH`` environment variable."

"Run the command below, replacing ``svg_source.svg`` with the path to your "
"SVG file (which can be a relative or absolute path):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``--multipass`` switch improves compression, so make sure to include it. "
"The optimized icon will be saved to ``svg_optimized.svg``. You can also "
"change the destination parameter to any relative or absolute path you'd like."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While this optimization step won't impact the icon's quality noticeably, it "
"will still remove editor-only information such as guides. Therefore, it's "
"recommended to keep the source SVG around if you need to make further "
"changes."

"the engine to make it pick up new icons for classes."

msgid ""
"It's also possible to create custom icons within a module. If you're "
"creating your own module and don't plan to integrate it with Godot, you "
"don't need to make a separate pull request for your icons to be available "
"within the editor as they can be self-contained."
