"Godot implements multi-threading as servers. Servers are daemons which "
"manage data, process it, and push the result. Servers implement the mediator "
"pattern which interprets resource ID and process data for the engine and "
"other modules. In addition, the server claims ownership for its RID "
"allocations."

msgid "Custom managed resource data"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot servers implement a mediator pattern. All data types inherit "
"``RID_Data``. ``RID_Owner<MyRID_Data>`` owns the object when ``make_rid`` is "
"called. During debug mode only, RID_Owner maintains a list of RIDs. In "
"practice, RIDs are similar to writing object-oriented C code."

"Servers are allocated in ``register_types.cpp``. The constructor sets the "
"static instance and ``init()`` creates the managed thread; "
"``unregister_types.cpp`` cleans up the server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since a Godot server class creates an instance and binds it to a static "
"singleton, binding the class might not reference the correct instance. "
"Therefore, a dummy class must be created to reference the proper Godot "
"server."

"In ``register_server_types()``, ``Engine::get_singleton()->add_singleton`` "
"is used to register the dummy class in GDScript."

"obtain the target object RID and use either ``push_call``, ``push_set``, or "
"``push_notification`` to execute the desired behavior. The queue will be "
"flushed whenever either ``SceneTree::idle`` or ``SceneTree::iteration`` is "
"executed."
