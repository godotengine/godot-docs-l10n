msgid "Optimizing a build for size"
msgstr ""

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes, it is desired to optimize a build for size rather than speed. "
"This means not compiling unused functions from the engine, as well as using "
"specific compiler flags to aid on decreasing build size. Common situations "
"include creating builds for mobile and Web platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial aims to give an overview on different methods to create a "
"smaller binary. Before continuing, it is recommended to read the previous "
"tutorials on compiling Godot for each platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The options below are listed from the most important (greatest size savings) "
"to the least important (lowest size savings)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stripping binaries"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Space savings:** Very high"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Difficulty:** Easy"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** Yes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you build Windows (MinGW), Linux or macOS binaries from source, remember "
"to strip debug symbols from binaries by installing the ``strip`` package "
"from your distribution then running:"
msgstr ""

msgid "On Windows, ``strip.exe`` is included in most MinGW toolchain setups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will reduce the size of compiled binaries by a factor between 5× and "
"10×. The downside is that crash backtraces will no longer provide accurate "
"information (which is useful for troubleshooting the cause of a crash). :ref:"
"`C++ profilers <doc_using_cpp_profilers>` will also no longer be able to "
"display function names (this does not affect the built-in GDScript profiler)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above command will not work on Windows binaries compiled with MSVC and "
"platforms such as Android and HTML5. Instead, pass ``debug_symbols=no`` on "
"the SCons command line when compiling."
msgstr ""

msgid "Optimizing for size instead of speed"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Space savings:** High"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** Yes, but only for HTML5"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot 3.1 onwards allows compiling using size optimizations (instead of "
"speed). To enable this, set the ``optimize`` flag to ``size``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some platforms such as WebAssembly already use this mode by default."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compiling with link-time optimization"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enabling link-time optimization produces more efficient binaries, both in "
"terms of performance and file size. It works by eliminating duplicate "
"template functions and unused code. It can currently be used with the GCC "
"and MSVC compilers:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Linking becomes much slower and more RAM-consuming with this option, so it "
"should be used only for release builds:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When compiling the ``master`` branch, you need to have at least 8 GB of RAM "
"available for successful linking with LTO enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When compiling the ``3.x`` branch, you need to have at least 6 GB of RAM "
"available for successful linking with LTO enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling 3D"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Space savings:** Moderate"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** No"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For 2D games, having the whole 3D engine available usually makes no sense. "
"Because of this, there is a build flag to disable it:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tools must be disabled in order to use this flag, as the editor is not "
"designed to operate without 3D support. Without it, the binary size can be "
"reduced by about 15%."

"Most small games don't require complex GUI controls such as Tree, ItemList, "
"TextEdit or GraphEdit. They can be disabled using a build flag:"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "**Space savings:** Very low to moderate depending on modules"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Difficulty:** Medium to hard depending on modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A lot of Godot's functions are offered as modules. You can see a list of "
"modules with the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The list of modules that can be disabled will appear, together with all "
"build options. If you are working on a simple 2D game, you could disable a "
"lot of them:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this proves not to work for your use case, you should review the list of "
"modules and see which ones you actually still need for your game (e.g. you "
"might want to keep networking-related modules, regex support, or theora/webm "
"to play videos)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can supply a list of disabled modules by creating "
"``custom.py`` at the root of the source, with the contents similar to the "
"following:"
