"A good rule of thumb for the ``-j`` (*jobs*) flag, is to have at least as "

"Linux binaries usually won't run on distributions that are older than the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You don't even need to copy them, you can just reference the resulting files "
"in the ``bin/`` directory of your Godot source folder, so the next time you "

"You can also use Clang and LLD to build Godot. This has two upsides compared "

"LLD links Godot significantly faster compared to GNU ld or gold. This leads "
"to faster iteration times."

"After the build is completed, a new binary with a ``.llvm`` suffix will be "
