"The export dialog gives you the option to encrypt your scripts with a 256-"
"bit AES key when releasing your project. This will make sure your scripts "
"are not stored in plain text and can not easily be ripped by some script "
"kiddie."

"Of course, the key needs to be stored in the binary, but if it's compiled, "
"optimized and without symbols, it would take some effort to find it."

"For this to work, you need to build the export templates from source, with "
"that same key."

msgid ""
"This will **not** work if you use official, precompiled export templates. It "
"is absolutely **required** to compile your own export templates to use PCK "
