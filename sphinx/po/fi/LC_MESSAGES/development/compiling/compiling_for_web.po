"Before starting, confirm that ``emcc`` is available in your PATH. This is "
"usually configured by the Emscripten SDK, e.g. when invoking ``emsdk "
"activate`` and ``source ./emsdk_env.sh``/``emsdk_env.bat``."

"Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the engine source "
"code. Then instruct SCons to build the JavaScript platform. Specify "

"By default, the :ref:`JavaScript singleton <doc_javascript_eval>` will be "

"The engine will now be compiled to WebAssembly by Emscripten. Once finished, "
