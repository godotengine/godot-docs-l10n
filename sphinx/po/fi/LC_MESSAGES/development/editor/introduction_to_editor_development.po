"If you are new to Godot, we recommended you to read :ref:"
"`doc_godot_design_philosophy` before continuing. Since the Godot editor is a "
"Godot project written in C++, much of the engine's philosophy applies to the "

"The Godot editor is drawn using Godot's renderer and :ref:`UI system <toc-"
"gui-basics>`. It does *not* rely on a toolkit such as GTK or Qt. This is "
"similar in spirit to software like Blender. While using toolkits makes it "
"easier to achieve a \"native\" appearance, they are also quite heavy and "
"their licensing is not compatible with Godot's."

"The editor is fully written in C++. It can't contain any GDScript or C# code."

"The editor's code is fully self-contained in the `editor/ <https://github."
"com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/editor>`__ folder of the Godot source "
"repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some editor functionality is also implemented via :ref:`modules "
"<doc_custom_modules_in_c++>`. Some of these are only enabled in editor "
"builds to decrease the binary size of export templates. See the `modules/ "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/modules>`__ folder in the "
"Godot source repository."

msgid "Some important files in the editor are:"

msgid ""
"`editor/editor_node.cpp <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/3.x/"
"editor/editor_node.cpp>`__: Main editor initialization file. Effectively the "
"\"main scene\" of the editor."

"`editor/plugins/canvas_item_editor_plugin.cpp <https://github.com/"

msgid ""
"When working on an editor feature, you may have to modify files in Godot's "
"GUI nodes, which you can find in the ``scene/`` folder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One rule to keep in mind is that you must **not** introduce new dependencies "
"to ``editor/`` includes in other folders such as ``scene/``. This applies "
"even if you use ``#ifdef TOOLS_ENABLED``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make the codebase easier to follow and more self-contained, the allowed "
"dependency order is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``editor/`` -> ``scene/`` -> ``servers/`` -> ``core/``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means that files in ``editor/`` can depend on includes from ``scene/``, "
"``servers/``, and ``core/``. But, for example, while ``scene/`` can depend "
"on includes from ``servers/`` and ``core/``, it cannot depend on includes "
"from ``editor/``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Currently, there are some dependencies to ``editor/`` includes in ``scene/`` "
