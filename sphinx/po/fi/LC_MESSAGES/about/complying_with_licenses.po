msgid ""
"Godot is created and distributed under the `MIT License <https://opensource."
"org/licenses/MIT>`_. It doesn't have a sole owner either, as every "
"contributor that submits code to the project does it under this same license "
"and keeps ownership of the contribution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The license is the legal requirement for you (or your company) to use and "
"distribute the software (and derivative projects, including games made with "
"it). Your game or project can have a different license, but it still needs "
"to comply with the original one."
msgstr ""

msgid "Requirements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the case of the MIT license, the only requirement is to include the "
"license text somewhere in your game or derivative project."

msgid "Inclusion"
msgstr "Liittäminen"

msgid ""
"The license does not specify how it has to be included, so anything is valid "
"as long as it can be displayed under some condition. These are the most "
"common approaches (only need to implement one of them, not all)."
msgstr ""
"Lisenssi ei määrittele kuinka se tulee liittää, joten mikä tahansa tapa käy "
"kunhan sitä voidaan tarkastella jollain tapaa. Nämä ovat yleisimpiä "
"lähestymistapoja (riittää että toteuttaa yhden niistä, ei kaikkia)."

msgid "Credits screen"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Include the above license text somewhere in the credits screen. It can be at "
"the bottom after showing the rest of the credits. Most large studios use "
"this approach with open source licenses."

"Just printing the licensing text using the :ref:`print() "
"<class_@GDScript_method_print>` function may be enough on platforms where a "
"global output log is readable. This is the case on desktop platforms, "
"Android and HTML5 (but not iOS and UWP)."
