msgid "Godot release policy"
msgstr "Godotin julkaisukäytäntö"

msgid ""
"Godot's release policy is in constant evolution. What is described below is "
"intended to give a general idea of what to expect, but what will actually "
"happen depends on the choices of core contributors, and the needs of the "
"community at a given time."
msgstr ""
"Godotin julkaisupolitiikka on jatkuvassa kehityksessä. Alla kuvatun on "
"tarkoitus antaa yleiskuva siitä mitä on odotettavissa, mutta se mitä todella "
"tapahtuu riippuu keskeisten tekijöiden valinnoista ja yhteisön tarpeista "
"tiettynä ajankohtana."

msgid "Godot versioning"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot loosely follows `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`__ with a "
"``major.minor.patch`` versioning system, albeit with an interpretation of "
"each term adapted to the complexity of a game engine:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``major`` version is incremented when major compatibility breakages "
"happen which imply significant porting work to move projects from one major "
"version to another."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, porting Godot projects from Godot 2.1 to Godot 3.0 required "
"running the project through a conversion tool, and then performing a number "
"of further adjustments manually for what the tool could not do automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``minor`` version is incremented for feature releases which do not break "
"compatibility in a major way. Minor compatibility breakage in very specific "
"areas *may* happen in minor versions, but the vast majority of projects "
"should not be affected or require significant porting work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The reason for this is that as a game engine, Godot covers many areas such "
"as rendering, physics, scripting, etc., and fixing bugs or implementing new "
"features in a given area may sometimes require changing the behavior of a "
"feature, or modifying the interface of a given class, even if the rest of "
"the engine API remains backwards compatible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Upgrading to a new minor version is therefore recommended for all users, but "
"some testing is necessary to ensure that your project still behaves as "
"expected in a new minor version."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``patch`` version is incremented for maintenance releases which focus on "
"fixing bugs and security issues, implementing new requirements for platform "
"support, and backporting safe usability enhancements. Patch releases are "
"backwards compatible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Patch versions may include minor new features which do not impact the "
"existing API, and thus have no risk of impacting existing projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Updating to new patch versions is therefore considered safe and strongly "
"recommended to all users of a given stable branch."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We call ``major.minor`` combinations *stable branches*. Each stable branch "
"starts with a ``major.minor`` release (without the ``0`` for ``patch``) and "
"is further developed for maintenance releases in a Git branch of the same "
"name (for example patch updates for the 3.3 stable branch are developed in "
"the ``3.3`` Git branch)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the introduction, Godot's release policy is evolving, and "
"earlier Godot releases may not have followed the above rules to the letter. "
"In particular, the 3.2 stable branch received a number of new features in "
"3.2.2 which would have warranted a ``minor`` version increment."
msgstr ""
"Kuten johdannossa mainittiin. Godotin julkaisukäytäntö kehittyy ja aiemmat "
"Godot-julkaisut eivät välttämättä ole noudattaneet edellä mainittuja "
"sääntöjä kirjaimellisesti. Erityisesti 3.2:n vakaa haara sai 3.2.2:ssa "
"useita uusia ominaisuuksia, jotka olisivat oikeuttaneet ``minor``-version "
"lisäyksen."

msgid "Release support timeline"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Stable branches are supported *at minimum* until the next stable branch is "
"released and has received its first patch update. In practice, we support "
"stable branches on a *best effort* basis for as long as they have active "
"users who need maintenance updates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whenever a new major version is released, we make the previous stable branch "
"a long-term supported release, and do our best to provide fixes for issues "
"encountered by users of that branch who cannot port complex projects to the "
"new major version. This was the case for the 2.1 branch, and will be the "
"case for the latest 3.x stable branch by the time Godot 4.0 is released."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In a given minor release series, only the latest patch release receives "
"support. If you experience an issue using an older patch release, please "
"upgrade to the latest patch release of that series and test again before "
"reporting an issue on GitHub."
