msgid ""
"It is often desired to use SSL connections for communications to avoid \"man "
"in the middle\" attacks. Godot has a connection wrapper, :ref:`StreamPeerSSL "
"<class_StreamPeerSSL>`, which can take a regular connection and add security "
"around it. The :ref:`HTTPClient <class_HTTPClient>` class also supports "
"HTTPS by using this same wrapper."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot includes SSL certificates from Mozilla, but you can provide your own "
"with a .crt file in the project settings:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This file should contain any number of public certificates in `PEM format "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Of course, remember to add .crt as filter so the exporter recognizes this "
"when exporting your project."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are two ways to obtain certificates:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Approach 1: self signed cert"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first approach is the simplest: generate a private and public key pair "
"and add the public key (in PEM format) to the .crt file. The private key "
"should go to your server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"OpenSSL has `some documentation <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openssl/"
"openssl/master/doc/HOWTO/keys.txt>`__ about this. This approach also **does "
"not require domain validation** nor requires you to spend a considerable "
"amount of money in purchasing certificates from a CA."
msgstr ""

msgid "Approach 2: CA cert"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second approach consists of using a certificate authority (CA) such as "
"Verisign, Geotrust, etc. This is a more cumbersome process, but it's more "
"\"official\" and ensures your identity is clearly represented."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unless you are working with large companies or corporations, or need to "
"connect to someone else's servers (i.e., connecting to Google or some other "
"REST API provider via HTTPS), this method is not as useful."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, when using a CA issued cert, **you must enable domain validation**, to "
"ensure the domain you are connecting to is the one intended, otherwise any "
"website can issue any certificate in the same CA and it will work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are using Linux, you can use the supplied certs file, generally "
"located in:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This file allows HTTPS connections to virtually any website (i.e., Google, "
"Microsoft, etc.)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or pick any of the more specific certificates there if you are connecting to "
"a specific one."
