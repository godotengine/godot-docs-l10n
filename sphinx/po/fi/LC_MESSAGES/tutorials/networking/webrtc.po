msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of Godot's great features is its ability to export to the HTML5/"
"WebAssembly platform, allowing your game to run directly in the browser when "
"a user visit your webpage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a great opportunity for both demos and full games, but used to come "
"with some limitations. In the area of networking, browsers used to support "
"only HTTPRequests until recently, when first WebSocket and then WebRTC were "
"proposed as standards."
msgstr ""

msgid "WebSocket"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the WebSocket protocol was standardized in December 2011, it allowed "
"browsers to create stable and bidirectional connections to a WebSocket "
"server. The protocol is quite simple, but a very powerful tool to send push "
"notifications to browsers, and has been used to implement chats, turn-based "
"games, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"WebSockets, though, still use a TCP connection, which is good for "
"reliability but not for latency, so not good for real-time applications like "
"VoIP and fast-paced games."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For this reason, since 2010, Google started working on a new technology "
"called WebRTC, which later on, in 2017, became a W3C candidate "
"recommendation. WebRTC is a much more complex set of specifications, and "
"relies on many other technologies behind the scenes (ICE, DTLS, SDP) to "
"provide fast, real-time, and secure communication between two peers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The idea is to find the fastest route between the two peers and establish "
"whenever possible a direct communication (i.e. try to avoid a relaying "
"server)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, this comes at a price, which is that some media information must be "
"exchanged between the two peers before the communication can start (in the "
"form of Session Description Protocol - SDP strings). This usually takes the "
"form of a so-called WebRTC Signaling Server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Peers connect to a signaling server (for example a WebSocket server) and "
"send their media information. The server then relays this information to "
"other peers, allowing them to establish the desired direct communication. "
"Once this step is done, peers can disconnect from the signaling server and "
"keep the direct Peer-to-Peer (P2P) connection open."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using WebRTC in Godot"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"WebRTC is implemented in Godot via two main classes :ref:"
"`WebRTCPeerConnection <class_WebRTCPeerConnection>` and :ref:"
"`WebRTCDataChannel <class_WebRTCDataChannel>`, plus the multiplayer API "
"implementation :ref:`WebRTCMultiplayer <class_WebRTCMultiplayer>`. See "
"section on :ref:`high-level multiplayer <doc_high_level_multiplayer>` for "
"more details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These classes are available automatically in HTML5, but **require an "
"external GDNative plugin on native (non-HTML5) platforms**. Check out the "
"`webrtc-native plugin repository <https://github.com/godotengine/webrtc-"
"native>`__ for instructions and to get the latest `release <https://github."
"com/godotengine/webrtc-native/releases>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the ``INTERNET`` permission "
"in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click "
"deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by "
"Android."
msgstr ""

msgid "Minimal connection example"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This example will show you how to create a WebRTC connection between two "
"peers in the same application. This is not very useful in real life, but "
"will give you a good overview of how a WebRTC connection is set up."
msgstr ""

msgid "This will print:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Local signaling example"
msgstr "Paikallinen signaloinnin esimerkki"

msgid ""
"This example expands on the previous one, separating the peers in two "
"different scenes, and using a :ref:`singleton <doc_singletons_autoload>` as "
"a signaling server."
msgstr ""

msgid "And now for the local signaling server:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This local signaling server is supposed to be used as a :ref:`singleton "
"<doc_singletons_autoload>` to connect two peers in the same scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then you can use it like this:"
msgstr "Sen jälkeen voit käyttää sitä näin:"

msgid "This will print something similar to this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Remote signaling with WebSocket"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A more advanced demo using WebSocket for signaling peers and :ref:"
"`WebRTCMultiplayer <class_WebRTCMultiplayer>` is available in the `godot "
"demo projects <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects>`_ under "
"`networking/webrtc_signaling`."
