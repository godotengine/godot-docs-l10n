"The WebSocket protocol was standardized in 2011 with the original goal of "
"allowing browsers to create stable and bidirectional connections with a "
"server. Before that, browsers used to only support HTTPRequests, which is "
"not well-suited for bidirectional communication."

"The protocol is quite simple, message based, and a very powerful tool to "
"send push notifications to browsers, and has been used to implement chats, "
"turn-based games, etc. It still uses a TCP connection, which is good for "
"reliability but not for latency, so not good for real-time applications like "
"VoIP and fast-paced games (see :ref:`WebRTC <doc_webrtc>` for those use "
"cases)."

"Due to its simplicity, its wide compatibility, and being easier to use than "
"a raw TCP connection, WebSocket soon started to spread outside the browsers, "
"in native applications as a mean to communicate with network servers."
