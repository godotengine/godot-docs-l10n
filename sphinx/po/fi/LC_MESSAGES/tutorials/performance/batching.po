"Game engines have to send a set of instructions to the GPU to tell the GPU "
"what and where to draw. These instructions are sent using common "
"instructions called :abbr:`APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)`. "
"Examples of graphics APIs are OpenGL, OpenGL ES, and Vulkan."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Different APIs incur different costs when drawing objects. OpenGL handles a "
"lot of work for the user in the GPU driver at the cost of more expensive "
"draw calls. As a result, applications can often be sped up by reducing the "
"number of draw calls."
msgstr ""

msgid "Draw calls"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In 2D, we need to tell the GPU to render a series of primitives (rectangles, "
"lines, polygons etc). The most obvious technique is to tell the GPU to "
"render one primitive at a time, telling it some information such as the "
"texture used, the material, the position, size, etc. then saying \"Draw!"
"\" (this is called a draw call)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While this is conceptually simple from the engine side, GPUs operate very "
"slowly when used in this manner. GPUs work much more efficiently if you tell "
"them to draw a number of similar primitives all in one draw call, which we "
"will call a \"batch\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It turns out that they don't just work a bit faster when used in this "
"manner; they work a *lot* faster."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As Godot is designed to be a general-purpose engine, the primitives coming "
"into the Godot renderer can be in any order, sometimes similar, and "
"sometimes dissimilar. To match Godot's general-purpose nature with the "
"batching preferences of GPUs, Godot features an intermediate layer which can "
"automatically group together primitives wherever possible and send these "
"batches on to the GPU. This can give an increase in rendering performance "
"while requiring few (if any) changes to your Godot project."
msgstr ""

msgid "How it works"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instructions come into the renderer from your game in the form of a series "
"of items, each of which can contain one or more commands. The items "
"correspond to Nodes in the scene tree, and the commands correspond to "
"primitives such as rectangles or polygons. Some items such as TileMaps and "
"text can contain a large number of commands (tiles and glyphs respectively). "
"Others, such as sprites, may only contain a single command (a rectangle)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The batcher uses two main techniques to group together primitives:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Consecutive items can be joined together."
msgstr ""

msgid "Consecutive commands within an item can be joined to form a batch."
msgstr ""

msgid "Breaking batching"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Batching can only take place if the items or commands are similar enough to "
"be rendered in one draw call. Certain changes (or techniques), by necessity, "
"prevent the formation of a contiguous batch, this is referred to as "
"\"breaking batching\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Batching will be broken by (amongst other things):"
msgstr ""

msgid "Change of texture."
msgstr "Tekstuurien vaihto."

msgid "Change of material."
msgstr ""

msgid "Change of primitive type (say, going from rectangles to lines)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, if you draw a series of sprites each with a different texture, "
"there is no way they can be batched."
msgstr ""

msgid "Determining the rendering order"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The question arises, if only similar items can be drawn together in a batch, "
"why don't we look through all the items in a scene, group together all the "
"similar items, and draw them together?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In 3D, this is often exactly how engines work. However, in Godot's 2D "
"renderer, items are drawn in \"painter's order\", from back to front. This "
"ensures that items at the front are drawn on top of earlier items when they "
"overlap."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This also means that if we try and draw objects on a per-texture basis, then "
"this painter's order may break and objects will be drawn in the wrong order."
msgstr ""

msgid "In Godot, this back-to-front order is determined by:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The order of objects in the scene tree."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Z index of objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "The canvas layer."
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`class_YSort` nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can group similar objects together for easier batching. While doing so "
"is not a requirement on your part, think of it as an optional approach that "
"can improve performance in some cases. See the :ref:"
"`doc_batching_diagnostics` section to help you make this decision."
msgstr ""

msgid "A trick"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And now, a sleight of hand. Even though the idea of painter's order is that "
"objects are rendered from back to front, consider 3 objects ``A``, ``B`` and "
"``C``, that contain 2 different textures: grass and wood."
msgstr ""

msgid "In painter's order they are ordered::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because of the texture changes, they can't be batched and will be rendered "
"in 3 draw calls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, painter's order is only needed on the assumption that they will be "
"drawn *on top* of each other. If we relax that assumption, i.e. if none of "
"these 3 objects are overlapping, there is *no need* to preserve painter's "
"order. The rendered result will be the same. What if we could take advantage "
"of this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Item reordering"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It turns out that we can reorder items. However, we can only do this if the "
"items satisfy the conditions of an overlap test, to ensure that the end "
"result will be the same as if they were not reordered. The overlap test is "
"very cheap in performance terms, but not absolutely free, so there is a "
"slight cost to looking ahead to decide whether items can be reordered. The "
"number of items to lookahead for reordering can be set in project settings "
"(see below), in order to balance the costs and benefits in your project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since the texture only changes once, we can render the above in only 2 draw "
"calls."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lights"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although the batching system's job is normally quite straightforward, it "
"becomes considerably more complex when 2D lights are used. This is because "
"lights are drawn using additional passes, one for each light affecting the "
"primitive. Consider 2 sprites ``A`` and ``B``, with identical texture and "
"material. Without lights, they would be batched together and drawn in one "
"draw call. But with 3 lights, they would be drawn as follows, each line "
"being a draw call:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is a lot of draw calls: 8 for only 2 sprites. Now, consider we are "
"drawing 1,000 sprites. The number of draw calls quickly becomes astronomical "
"and performance suffers. This is partly why lights have the potential to "
"drastically slow down 2D rendering."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, if you remember our magician's trick from item reordering, it turns "
"out we can use the same trick to get around painter's order for lights!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``A`` and ``B`` are not overlapping, we can render them together in a "
"batch, so the drawing process is as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is only 4 draw calls. Not bad, as that is a 2× reduction. However, "
"consider that in a real game, you might be drawing closer to 1,000 sprites."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Before:** 1000 × 4 = 4,000 draw calls."
msgstr ""

msgid "**After:** 1 × 4 = 4 draw calls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is a 1000× decrease in draw calls, and should give a huge increase in "
"performance."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Overlap test"
msgstr "Päällekkäisyyden tunnistaminen"

msgid ""
"However, as with the item reordering, things are not that simple. We must "
"first perform the overlap test to determine whether we can join these "
"primitives. This overlap test has a small cost. Again, you can choose the "
"number of primitives to lookahead in the overlap test to balance the "
"benefits against the cost. With lights, the benefits usually far outweigh "
"the costs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also consider that depending on the arrangement of primitives in the "
"viewport, the overlap test will sometimes fail (because the primitives "
"overlap and therefore shouldn't be joined). In practice, the decrease in "
"draw calls may be less dramatic than in a perfect situation with no "
"overlapping at all. However, performance is usually far higher than without "
"this lighting optimization."
msgstr ""

msgid "Light scissoring"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Batching can make it more difficult to cull out objects that are not "
"affected or partially affected by a light. This can increase the fill rate "
"requirements quite a bit and slow down rendering. *Fill rate* is the rate at "
"which pixels are colored. It is another potential bottleneck unrelated to "
"draw calls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to counter this problem (and speed up lighting in general), "
"batching introduces light scissoring. This enables the use of the OpenGL "
"command ``glScissor()``, which identifies an area outside of which the GPU "
"won't render any pixels. We can greatly optimize fill rate by identifying "
"the intersection area between a light and a primitive, and limit rendering "
"the light to *that area only*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Light scissoring is controlled with the :ref:`scissor_area_threshold "
"<class_ProjectSettings_property_rendering/batching/lights/"
"scissor_area_threshold>` project setting. This value is between 1.0 and 0.0, "
"with 1.0 being off (no scissoring), and 0.0 being scissoring in every "
"circumstance. The reason for the setting is that there may be some small "
"cost to scissoring on some hardware. That said, scissoring should usually "
"result in performance gains when you're using 2D lighting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The relationship between the threshold and whether a scissor operation takes "
"place is not always straightforward. Generally, it represents the pixel area "
"that is potentially \"saved\" by a scissor operation (i.e. the fill rate "
"saved). At 1.0, the entire screen's pixels would need to be saved, which "
"rarely (if ever) happens, so it is switched off. In practice, the useful "
"values are close to 0.0, as only a small percentage of pixels need to be "
"saved for the operation to be useful."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The exact relationship is probably not necessary for users to worry about, "
"but is included in the appendix out of interest: :ref:"
"`doc_batching_light_scissoring_threshold_calculation`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Light scissoring example diagram"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bottom right is a light, the red area is the pixels saved by the scissoring "
"operation. Only the intersection needs to be rendered."

msgid "Vertex baking"
msgstr "Kärkipisteen valmismuuttujat"

msgid "The GPU shader receives instructions on what to draw in 2 main ways:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Shader uniforms (e.g. modulate color, item transform)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Vertex attributes (vertex color, local transform)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, within a single draw call (batch), we cannot change uniforms. This "
"means that naively, we would not be able to batch together items or commands "
"that change ``final_modulate`` or an item's transform. Unfortunately, that "
"happens in an awful lot of cases. For instance, sprites are typically "
"individual nodes with their own item transform, and they may have their own "
"color modulate as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get around this problem, the batching can \"bake\" some of the uniforms "
"into the vertex attributes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The item transform can be combined with the local transform and sent in a "
"vertex attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The final modulate color can be combined with the vertex colors, and sent in "
"a vertex attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases, this works fine, but this shortcut breaks down if a shader "
"expects these values to be available individually rather than combined. This "
"can happen in custom shaders."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Custom shaders"
msgstr "Mukautetut signaalit"

msgid ""
"As a result of the limitation described above, certain operations in custom "
"shaders will prevent vertex baking and therefore decrease the potential for "
"batching. While we are working to decrease these cases, the following "
"caveats currently apply:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Reading or writing ``COLOR`` or ``MODULATE`` disables vertex color baking."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reading ``VERTEX``  disables vertex position baking."

msgid "Project Settings"
msgstr "varoitusjärjestelmän projektikohtaiset asetukset"

msgid ""
"To fine-tune batching, a number of project settings are available. You can "
"usually leave these at default during development, but it's a good idea to "
"experiment to ensure you are getting maximum performance. Spending a little "
"time tweaking parameters can often give considerable performance gains for "
"very little effort. See the on-hover tooltips in the Project Settings for "

msgid ""
":ref:`max_join_item_commands <class_ProjectSettings_property_rendering/"
"batching/parameters/max_join_item_commands>` - One of the most important "
"ways of achieving batching is to join suitable adjacent items (nodes) "
"together, however they can only be joined if the commands they contain are "
"compatible. The system must therefore do a lookahead through the commands in "
"an item to determine whether it can be joined. This has a small cost per "

":ref:`colored_vertex_format_threshold "
"<class_ProjectSettings_property_rendering/batching/parameters/"
"colored_vertex_format_threshold>` - Baking colors into vertices results in a "

"Although you can change parameters and examine the effect on frame rate, "
