"Shaders are special programs that execute on the GPU and are used for "
"rendering graphics. All modern rendering is done with shaders. For a more "
"detailed description of what shaders are please see :ref:`What are shaders "
"<doc_introduction_to_shaders>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial will focus on the practical aspects of writing shader programs "
"by walking you through the process of writing a shader with both vertex and "
"fragment functions. This tutorial targets absolute beginners to shaders."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have experience writing shaders and are just looking for an overview "
"of how shaders work in Godot, see the :ref:`Shading Reference <toc-shading-"

":ref:`CanvasItem <doc_canvas_item_shader>` shaders are used to draw all 2D"
msgstr ":ref:`Helposti kirjoitettevat sävyttimet <doc_shading_language>`"

msgid ""
"objects in Godot, while :ref:`Spatial <doc_spatial_shader>` shaders are used "
"to draw all 3D objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to use a shader it must be attached inside a :ref:`Material "
"<class_material>` which must be attached to an object. Materials are a type "
"of :ref:`Resource <doc_resources>`. To draw multiple objects with the same "
"material, the material must be attached to each object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All objects derived from a :ref:`CanvasItem <class_canvasitem>` have a "
"material property. This includes all :ref:`GUI elements <class_Control>`, :"
"ref:`Sprites <class_sprite>`, :ref:`TileMaps <class_tilemap>`, :ref:"
"`MeshInstance2Ds <class_meshinstance2d>` etc. They also have an option to "
"inherit their parent's material. This can be useful if you have a large "
"number of nodes that you want to use the same material."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To begin, create a Sprite node. You can use any CanvasItem, but for this "
"tutorial we will use a Sprite."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the Inspector, click beside \"Texture\" where it says \"[empty]\" and "
"select \"Load\", then select \"Icon.png\". For new projects, this is the "
"Godot icon. You should now see the icon in the viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, look down in the Inspector, under the CanvasItem section, click beside "
"\"Material\" and select \"New ShaderMaterial\". This creates a new Material "
"resource. Click on the sphere that appears. Godot currently doesn't know "
"whether you are writing a CanvasItem Shader or a Spatial Shader and it "
"previews the output of spatial shaders. So what you are seeing is the output "
"of the default Spatial Shader."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click beside \"Shader\" and select \"New Shader\". Finally, click on the new "
"shader resource and the shader editor will open. You are now ready to begin "
"writing your first shader."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your first CanvasItem shader"
msgstr "Ensimmäinen CanvasItem sävyttimesi"

msgid ""
"In Godot, all shaders start with a line specifying what type of shader they "
"are. It uses the following format:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because we are writing a CanvasItem shader, we specify ``canvas_item`` in "
"the first line. All our code will go beneath this declaration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This line tells the engine which built-in variables and functionality to "
"supply you with."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot you can override three functions to control how the shader "
"operates; ``vertex``, ``fragment``, and ``light``. This tutorial will walk "
"you through writing a shader with both vertex and fragment functions. Light "
"functions are significantly more complex than vertex and fragment functions "
"and so will not be covered here."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your first fragment function"
msgstr "Ensimmäinen fragment funktiosi"

msgid ""
"The fragment function runs for every pixel in a Sprite and determines what "
"color that pixel should be."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They are restricted to the pixels covered by the Sprite, that means you "
"cannot use one to, for example, create an outline around a Sprite."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The most basic fragment function does nothing except assign a single color "
"to every pixel."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We do so by writing a ``vec4`` to the built-in variable ``COLOR``. ``vec4`` "
"is shorthand for constructing a vector with 4 numbers. For more information "
"about vectors see the :ref:`Vector math tutorial <doc_vector_math>` "
"``COLOR`` is both an input variable to the fragment function and the final "
"output from it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Congratulations! You're done. You have successfully written your first "
"shader in Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now let's make things more complex."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are many inputs to the fragment function that you can use for "
"calculating ``COLOR``. ``UV`` is one of them. UV coordinates are specified "
"in your Sprite (without you knowing it!) and they tell the shader where to "
"read from textures for each part of the mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the fragment function you can only read from ``UV``, but you can use it "
"in other functions or to assign values to ``COLOR`` directly."
msgstr ""

msgid "``UV`` varies between 0-1 from left-right and from top-bottom."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using ``TEXTURE`` built-in"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you want to adjust a color in a Sprite you cannot just adjust the color "
"from the texture manually like in the code below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default fragment function reads from a texture and displays it. When you "
"overwrite the default fragment function, you lose that functionality, so you "
"have to implement it yourself. You read from textures using the ``texture`` "
"function. Certain nodes, like Sprites, have a dedicated texture variable "
"that can be accessed in the shader using ``TEXTURE``. Use it together with "
"``UV`` and ``texture`` to draw the Sprite."
msgstr ""

msgid "Uniform input"
msgstr "Uniform-syöte"

msgid ""
"Uniform input is used to pass data into a shader that will be the same "
"across the entire shader."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use uniforms by defining them at the top of your shader like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more information about usage see the :ref:`Shading Language doc "
"<doc_shading_language>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add a uniform to change the amount of blue in our Sprite."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you can change the amount of blue in the Sprite from the editor. Look "
"back at the Inspector under where you created your shader. You should see a "
"section called \"Shader Param\". Unfold that section and you will see the "
"uniform you just declared. If you change the value in the editor, it will "
"overwrite the default value you provided in the shader."
msgstr ""

msgid "Interacting with shaders from code"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can change uniforms from code using the function ``set_shader_param()`` "
"which is called on the node's material resource. With a Sprite node, the "
"following code can be used to set the ``blue`` uniform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the name of the uniform is a string. The string must match exactly "
"with how it is written in the shader, including spelling and case."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your first vertex function"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now that we have a fragment function, let's write a vertex function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the vertex function to calculate where on the screen each vertex should "
"end up."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The most important variable in the vertex function is ``VERTEX``. Initially, "
"it specifies the vertex coordinates in your model, but you also write to it "
"to determine where to actually draw those vertices. ``VERTEX`` is a ``vec2`` "
"that is initially presented in local-space (i.e. not relative to the camera, "
"viewport, or parent nodes)."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can offset the vertices by directly adding to ``VERTEX``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Combined with the ``TIME`` built-in variable, this can be used for simple "
"animation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Conclusion"
msgstr "Lopputulos"

msgid ""
"At their core, shaders do what you have seen so far, they compute ``VERTEX`` "
"and ``COLOR``. It is up to you to dream up more complex mathematical "
"strategies for assigning values to those variables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For inspiration, take a look at some of the more advanced shader tutorials, "
"and look at other sites like `Shadertoy <https://www.shadertoy.com/results?"
"query=&sort=popular&from=10&num=4>`_ and `The Book of Shaders <https://"
"thebookofshaders.com>`_."
