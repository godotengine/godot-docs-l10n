"Godot has a special system to tag availability of features. Each *feature* "
"is represented as a string, which can refer to many of the following:"

"With the exception of texture compression feature tags, default feature tags "
"are **immutable**. This means that they will *not* change depending on run-"
"time conditions. For example, ``OS.has_feature(\"mobile\")`` will return "
"``false`` when running a project exported to HTML5 on a mobile device."

"the *export preset* used to generate it:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Custom feature tags are only used when running the exported project "
"(including with :ref:`doc_one-click_deploy`). They are **not used** when "
"running the project from the editor, even if the export preset marked as "
"**Runnable** for your current platform has custom feature tags defined."
msgstr ""

msgid "Overriding project settings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Features can be used to override specific configuration values in the "
"*Project Settings*. This allows you to better customize any configuration "
"when doing a build."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the following example, a different icon is added for the demo build of "
"the game (which was customized in a special export preset, which, in turn, "
"includes only demo levels)."
msgstr ""

msgid "After overriding, a new field is added for this specific configuration:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the :ref:`project settings \"override.cfg\" functionality "
"<class_ProjectSettings>` (which is unrelated to feature tags), remember that "
"feature tags still apply. Therefore, make sure to *also* override the "
"setting with the desired feature tag(s) if you want them to override base "
"project settings on all platforms and configurations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default overrides"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are already a lot of settings that come with overrides by default; "
"they can be found in many sections of the project settings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customizing the build"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Feature tags can be used to customize a build process too, by writing a "
"custom **ExportPlugin**. They are also used to specify which shared library "
"is loaded and exported in **GDNative**."
