"Windows does not use formats such as png or jpg for application icons. "
"Instead, it uses a Windows-only format called ICO. You can create your "
"application icon in any program but you will have to convert it to an ICO "
"file using a program such as GIMP."

msgid ""
"`This video tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqV3UfM-n5Y>`_ goes "
"over how to export an ICO file with GIMP."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is also possible to convert a PNG image to an hiDPI-friendly ICO file "
"using this `ImageMagick <https://www.imagemagick.org/>`_ command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Depending on which version of ImageMagick you installed, you might need to "
"leave out the ``magick`` and run this command instead:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the ICO file to effectively replace the default Godot icon, it must "
"contain *all* the sizes included in the default Godot icon: 16×16, 32×32, "
"48×48, 64×64, 128×128, 256×256. If the ICO file does not contain all the "
"sizes, the default Godot icon will be kept for the sizes that weren't "
"overridden."
msgstr ""

msgid "The above ImageMagick command takes this into account."

msgid "Changing the taskbar icon"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The taskbar icon is the icon that shows up on the taskbar when your project "
"is running."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To change the taskbar icon, go to **Project → Project Settings → Application "
"→ Config → Windows Native Icon**. Click on the folder icon and select your "
"ICO file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This setting only changes the icon for your exported game on Windows. To set "
"the icon for macOS, use ``Macos Native Icon``. And for any other platform, "
"use the ``Icon`` setting."

msgid "Changing the file icon"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot 3.5 and later, you can change the file icon without external tools "
"using `godoticon <https://github.com/pkowal1982/godoticon>`__. Changing the "
"file icon this way should work for executables containing an embedded PCK."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are `known issues <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/"
"issues/33466>`__ when changing the application icon in executables that "
"embed a PCK file. It's recommended to avoid using rcedit for now if you "
"choose to enable the **Embed Pck** option for your Windows export preset in "
"the Export dialog."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The file icon is the icon of the executable that you click on to start the "
"project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before selecting it in the export options, you will need to install an extra "
"tool called **rcedit**. You can download it `here <https://github.com/"
"electron/rcedit/releases>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After downloading, you need to tell Godot the path to the rcedit executable "
"on your computer. Go to **Editor → Editor Settings → Export → Windows**. "
"Click on the folder icon for the **rcedit** entry. Navigate to and select "
"the rcedit executable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Linux and macOS users will also need to install `WINE <https://www.winehq."
"org/>`_ to use rcedit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should now have everything in place to change the file icon. To do that, "
"you will need to specify the icon when exporting. Go to **Project → "
"Export**. Assuming you have already created a Windows Desktop preset, select "
"your icon in ICO format in the **Application → Icon** field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If rcedit fails to change the icon, you can instead :ref:`compile your own "
"Windows export templates <doc_compiling_for_windows>` with the icon changed. "
"To do so, replace `platform/windows/godot.ico <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot/blob/master/platform/windows/godot.ico>`__ with your own "
"ICO file *before* compiling export templates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once this is done, you can specify your export templates as custom export "
"templates in your project's Windows export preset."

msgid ""
"You can now export the project. If it worked correctly, you should see this:"

msgid ""
"If your icon isn't showing up properly, on Windows 10, try clearing the icon "
"cache. To do so, open the **Run** dialog and enter ``ie4uinit.exe -"
"ClearIconCache`` or ``ie4uinit.exe -show``."
