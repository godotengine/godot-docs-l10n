msgid "What is Visual Scripting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Visual Scripting is a tool designed to make the entry barrier to programming "
"much lower. As code is more visual, it needs less abstract thinking to be "
"understood. Any artist, animator, game designer, etc. can look at it and "
"quickly grasp the flow of logic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The reason it does not make existing programming obsolete is, simply, that "
"it does not scale as well. It takes considerably more time to create code "
"with it, and it's often more difficult to modify than just writing a few "
"characters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the misunderstanding cleared up, the question that remains is what are "
"the practical uses for Visual Scripting."
msgstr ""

msgid "The most common use cases are as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Game development beginners who want to learn an engine but have no "
"programming experience yet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Artists and Game Designers who have no experience in programming and want to "
"create quick prototypes or simple games."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Programmers working in a team that want to make part of the game logic "
"available to Artists or Game Designers in order to offload some of their "
"work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These scenarios are far more common than one might think, so this is why "
"Godot has added this feature."
