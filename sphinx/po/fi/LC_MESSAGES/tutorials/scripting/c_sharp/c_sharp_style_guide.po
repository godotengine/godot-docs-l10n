"Having well-defined and consistent coding conventions is important for every "
"project, and Godot is no exception to this rule."

msgid ""
"This page contains a coding style guide, which is followed by developers of "
"and contributors to Godot itself. As such, it is mainly intended for those "
"who want to contribute to the project, but since the conventions and "
"guidelines mentioned in this article are those most widely adopted by the "
"users of the language, we encourage you to do the same, especially if you do "
"not have such a guide yet."

"This article is by no means an exhaustive guide on how to follow the "
"standard coding conventions or best practices. If you feel unsure of an "
"aspect which is not covered here, please refer to more comprehensive "
"documentation, such as `C# Coding Conventions <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-"

msgid ""
"Godot currently uses **C# version 7.0** in its engine and example source "
"code. So, before we move to a newer version, care must be taken to avoid "
"mixing language features only available in C# 7.1 or later."

msgid "Use line feed (**LF**) characters to break lines, not CRLF or CR."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use one line feed character at the end of each file, except for `csproj` "
"files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use **UTF-8** encoding without a `byte order mark <https://en.wikipedia.org/"
"wiki/Byte_order_mark>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use **4 spaces** instead of tabs for indentation (which is referred to as "
"\"soft tabs\")."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider breaking a line into several if it's longer than 100 characters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Line breaks and blank lines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a general indentation rule, follow `the \"Allman Style\" <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style>`_ which recommends "
"placing the brace associated with a control statement on the next line, "
"indented to the same level:"
msgstr ""

msgid "However, you may choose to omit line breaks inside brackets:"
msgstr ""

msgid "For simple property accessors."
msgstr ""

msgid "For simple object, array, or collection initializers."
msgstr ""

msgid "For abstract auto property, indexer, or event declarations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Insert a blank line:"
msgstr ""

msgid "After a list of ``using`` statements."
msgstr ""

msgid "Between method, properties, and inner type declarations."
msgstr ""

msgid "At the end of each file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Field and constant declarations can be grouped together according to "
"relevance. In that case, consider inserting a blank line between the groups "
"for easier reading."
msgstr ""

msgid "Avoid inserting a blank line:"
msgstr ""

msgid "After ``{``, the opening brace."
msgstr ""

msgid "Before ``}``, the closing brace."
msgstr ""

msgid "After a comment block or a single-line comment."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adjacent to another blank line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using spaces"
msgstr "Välilyöntien käyttö"

msgid "Insert a space:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Around a binary and tertiary operator."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Between an opening parenthesis and ``if``, ``for``, ``foreach``, ``catch``, "
"``while``, ``lock`` or ``using`` keywords."
msgstr ""

msgid "Before and within a single line accessor block."
msgstr ""

msgid "Between accessors in a single line accessor block."
msgstr ""

msgid "After a comma which is not at the end of a line."
msgstr ""

msgid "After a semicolon in a ``for`` statement."
msgstr ""

msgid "After a colon in a single line ``case`` statement."
msgstr ""

msgid "Around a colon in a type declaration."
msgstr ""

msgid "Around a lambda arrow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After a single-line comment symbol (``//``), and before it if used at the "
"end of a line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not use a space:"
msgstr ""

msgid "After type cast parentheses."
msgstr ""

msgid "Within single line initializer braces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following example shows a proper use of spaces, according to some of the "
"above mentioned conventions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Naming conventions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use **PascalCase** for all namespaces, type names and member level "
"identifiers (i.e. methods, properties, constants, events), except for "
"private fields:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use **camelCase** for all other identifiers (i.e. local variables, method "
"arguments), and use an underscore (``_``) as a prefix for private fields "
"(but not for methods or properties, as explained above):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There's an exception with acronyms which consist of two letters, like "
"``UI``, which should be written in uppercase letters where PascalCase would "
"be expected, and in lowercase letters otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that ``id`` is **not** an acronym, so it should be treated as a normal "
"identifier:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is generally discouraged to use a type name as a prefix of an identifier, "
"like ``string strText`` or ``float fPower``, for example. An exception is "
"made, however, for interfaces, which **should**, in fact, have an uppercase "
"letter ``I`` prefixed to their names, like ``IInventoryHolder`` or "
"``IDamageable``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Lastly, consider choosing descriptive names and do not try to shorten them "
"too much if it affects readability."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For instance, if you want to write code to find a nearby enemy and hit it "
"with a weapon, prefer:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Rather than:"

msgid "Member variables"
msgstr "Jäsenet"

msgid ""
"Don't declare member variables if they are only used locally in a method, as "
"it makes the code more difficult to follow. Instead, declare them as local "
"variables in the method's body."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Local variables"
msgstr "Paikalliset taulukot"

msgid ""
"Declare local variables as close as possible to their first use. This makes "
"it easier to follow the code, without having to scroll too much to find "
"where the variable was declared."
msgstr ""

msgid "Implicitly typed local variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider using implicitly typing (``var``) for declaration of a local "
"variable, but do so **only when the type is evident** from the right side of "
"the assignment:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Other considerations"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use explicit access modifiers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use properties instead of non-private fields."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use modifiers in this order: ``public``/``protected``/``private``/"
"``internal``/``virtual``/``override``/``abstract``/``new``/``static``/"
"``readonly``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Avoid using fully-qualified names or ``this.`` prefix for members when it's "
"not necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remove unused ``using`` statements and unnecessary parentheses."
msgstr ""

msgid "Consider omitting the default initial value for a type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider using null-conditional operators or type initializers to make the "
"code more compact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use safe cast when there is a possibility of the value being a different "
"type, and use direct cast otherwise."
