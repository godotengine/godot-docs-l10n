"C# support is a new feature available since Godot 3.0. As such, you may "
"still run into some issues, or find spots where the documentation could be "
"improved. Please report issues with C# in Godot on the `engine GitHub page "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues>`_, and any documentation "
"issues on the `documentation GitHub page <https://github.com/godotengine/"

"This page provides a brief introduction to C#, both what it is and how to "
"use it in Godot. Afterwards, you may want to look at :ref:`how to use "
"specific features <doc_c_sharp_features>`, read about the :ref:`differences "
"between the C# and the GDScript API <doc_c_sharp_differences>` and (re)visit "

"C# is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft. In Godot, it "
"is implemented with the Mono 6.x .NET framework, including full support for "
"C# 8.0. Mono is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework "
"based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common Language Runtime. A good "
"starting point for checking its capabilities is the `Compatibility <http://"
"www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/compatibility/>`_ page in the Mono "
"documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is **not** a full-scale tutorial on the C# language as a whole. If you "
"aren't already familiar with its syntax or features, see the `Microsoft C# "
"guide <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/index>`_ or look for a "
"suitable introduction elsewhere."

msgid ""
"Install the latest stable version of the `.NET SDK <https://dotnet.microsoft."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From Godot 3.2.3 onwards, installing Mono SDK is not a requirement anymore, "
"except it is required if you are building the engine from source."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot bundles the parts of Mono needed to run already compiled games. "
"However, Godot does not bundle the tools required to build and compile "
"games, such as MSBuild and the C# compiler. These are included in the .NET "
"SDK, which needs to be installed separately."

"In summary, you must have installed the .NET SDK **and** the Mono-enabled "

"When you create the first C# script, Godot initializes the C# project files "
"for your Godot project. This includes generating a C# solution (``.sln``) "
"and a project file (``.csproj``), as well as some utility files and folders "
"(``.mono`` and ``Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs``). All of these but ``.mono`` "
"are important and should be committed to your version control system. ``."
"mono`` can be safely added to the ignore list of your VCS. When "

msgid ""
"Attached C# scripts should refer to a class that has a class name that "
"matches the file name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are some methods such as ``Get()``/``Set()``, ``Call()``/"
"``CallDeferred()`` and signal connection method ``Connect()`` that rely on "
"Godot's ``snake_case`` API naming conventions. So when using e.g. "
"``CallDeferred(\"AddChild\")``, ``AddChild`` will not work because the API "
"is expecting the original ``snake_case`` version ``add_child``. However, you "
"can use any custom properties or methods without this limitation."

msgid ""
"Exporting Mono projects is supported for desktop platforms (Linux, Windows "
"and macOS), Android, HTML5, and iOS. The only platform not supported yet is "
"UWP."

msgid "Performance of C# in Godot"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"According to some preliminary `benchmarks <https://github.com/cart/godot3-"
"bunnymark>`_, the performance of C# in Godot — while generally in the same "
"order of magnitude — is roughly **~4×** that of GDScript in some naive "
"cases. C++ is still a little faster; the specifics are going to vary "
"according to your use case. GDScript is likely fast enough for most general "
"scripting workloads. C# is faster, but requires some expensive marshalling "
"when talking to Godot."

msgid "Using NuGet packages in Godot"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`NuGet <https://www.nuget.org/>`_ packages can be installed and used with "
"Godot, as with any C# project. Many IDEs are able to add packages directly. "
"They can also be added manually by adding the package reference in the ``."
