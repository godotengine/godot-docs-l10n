msgid ""
"This page provides an overview of the commonly used features of both C# and "
"Godot and how they are used together."
msgstr ""

msgid "Type conversion and casting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"C# is a statically typed language. Therefore, you can't do the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The method ``GetNode()`` returns a ``Node`` instance. You must explicitly "
"convert it to the desired derived type, ``Sprite`` in this case."
msgstr ""

msgid "For this, you have various options in C#."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Casting and Type Checking**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Throws ``InvalidCastException`` if the returned node cannot be cast to "
"Sprite. You would use it instead of the ``as`` operator if you are pretty "
"sure it won't fail."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Using the AS operator**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``as`` operator returns ``null`` if the node cannot be cast to Sprite, "
"and for that reason, it cannot be used with value types."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Using the generic methods**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generic methods are also provided to make this type conversion transparent."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``GetNode<T>()`` casts the node before returning it. It will throw an "
"``InvalidCastException`` if the node cannot be cast to the desired type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``GetNodeOrNull<T>()`` uses the ``as`` operator and will return ``null`` if "
"the node cannot be cast to the desired type."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Type checking using the IS operator**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check if the node can be cast to Sprite, you can use the ``is`` operator. "
"The ``is`` operator returns false if the node cannot be cast to Sprite, "
"otherwise it returns true."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more advanced type checking, you can look into `Pattern Matching "
"<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/pattern-matching>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "C# signals"
msgstr "C# signaalit"

msgid ""
"For a complete C# example, see the **Handling a signal** section in the step "
"by step :ref:`doc_scripting` tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Declaring a signal in C# is done with the ``[Signal]`` attribute on a "
"delegate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These signals can then be connected either in the editor or from code with "
"``Connect``. If you want to connect a signal in the editor, you need to "
"(re)build the project assemblies to see the new signal. This build can be "
"manually triggered by clicking the “Build” button at the top right corner of "
"the editor window."
msgstr ""

msgid "Emitting signals is done with the ``EmitSignal`` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice that you can always reference a signal name with the ``nameof`` "
"keyword (applied on the delegate itself)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to bind values when establishing a connection by passing a "
"Godot array."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Signals support parameters and bound values of all the `built-in types "
"<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/"
"built-in-types-table>`_ and Classes derived from :ref:`Godot.Object "
"<class_Object>`. Consequently, any ``Node`` or ``Reference`` will be "
"compatible automatically, but custom data objects will need to extend from "
"`Godot.Object` or one of its subclasses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, signals can be created by calling ``AddUserSignal``, but be aware "
"that it should be executed before any use of said signals (with ``Connect`` "
"or ``EmitSignal``)."

msgid "Preprocessor defines"
msgstr "Käsittelyfunktiot"

msgid ""
"Godot has a set of defines that allow you to change your C# code depending "
"on the environment you are compiling to."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you created your project before Godot 3.2, you have to modify or "
"regenerate your `csproj` file to use this feature (compare "
"``<DefineConstants>`` with a new 3.2+ project)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples"
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, you can change code based on the platform:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or you can detect which engine your code is in, useful for making cross-"
"engine libraries:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Full list of defines"
msgstr ""

msgid "``GODOT`` is always defined for Godot projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of ``GODOT_64`` or ``GODOT_32`` is defined depending on if the "
"architecture is 64-bit or 32-bit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of ``GODOT_X11``, ``GODOT_WINDOWS``, ``GODOT_OSX``, ``GODOT_ANDROID``, "
"``GODOT_IOS``, ``GODOT_HTML5``, or ``GODOT_SERVER`` depending on the OS. "
"These names may change in the future. These are created from the "
"``get_name()`` method of the :ref:`OS <class_OS>` singleton, but not every "
"possible OS the method returns is an OS that Godot with Mono runs on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When **exporting**, the following may also be defined depending on the "
"export features:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of ``GODOT_PC``, ``GODOT_MOBILE``, or ``GODOT_WEB`` depending on the "
"platform type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of ``GODOT_ARM64_V8A`` or ``GODOT_ARMEABI_V7A`` on Android only "
"depending on the architecture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of ``GODOT_ARM64`` or ``GODOT_ARMV7`` on iOS only depending on the "
"architecture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any of ``GODOT_S3TC``, ``GODOT_ETC``, and ``GODOT_ETC2`` depending on the "
"texture compression type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any custom features added in the export menu will be capitalized and "
"prefixed: ``foo`` -> ``GODOT_FOO``."
msgstr ""
