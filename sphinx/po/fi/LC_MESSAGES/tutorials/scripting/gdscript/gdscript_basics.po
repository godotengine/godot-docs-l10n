"*GDScript* is a high-level, dynamically typed programming language used to "
"create content. It uses a syntax similar to `Python <https://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29>`_ (blocks are indent-based and "
"many keywords are similar). Its goal is to be optimized for and tightly "
"integrated with Godot Engine, allowing great flexibility for content "
"creation and integration."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any string that restricts itself to alphabetic characters (``a`` to ``z`` "

msgid "Keywords"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following is the list of keywords supported by the language. Since "
"keywords are reserved words (tokens), they can't be used as identifiers. "

msgid "Casting"

msgid ""
"Casting is also useful to have better type-safe variables when interacting "
"with the scene tree::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Constants"
msgstr "Vakiot"

msgid ""
"Constants are values you cannot change when the game is running. Their value "
"must be known at compile-time. Using the ``const`` keyword allows you to "
"give a constant value a name. Trying to assign a value to a constant after "
"it's declared will give you an error."
msgstr ""

msgid "We recommend using constants whenever a value is not meant to change."

msgid "Assigning a value of an incompatible type will raise an error."

"though."

msgid "Enums"

msgid ""
"Enums are basically a shorthand for constants, and are pretty useful if you "
"want to assign consecutive integers to some constant."

msgid ""
"If you pass a name to the enum, it will put all the keys inside a constant "
"dictionary of that name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot 3.1 and later, keys in a named enum are not registered as global "
"constants. They should be accessed prefixed by the enum's name (``Name."
"KEY``); see an example below."

msgid "Functions"
msgstr "Funktiot"

msgid ""
"Functions always belong to a `class <Classes_>`_. The scope priority for "
"variable look-up is: local → class member → global. The ``self`` variable is "

"A function can ``return`` at any point. The default return value is ``null``."

"The return type of the function can be specified after the arguments list "
"using the arrow token (``->``)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Functions that have a return type **must** return a proper value. Setting "
"the type as ``void`` means the function doesn't return anything. Void "
"functions can return early with the ``return`` keyword, but they can't "
"return any value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Non-void functions must **always** return a value, so if your code has "
"branching statements (such as an ``if``/``else`` construct), all the "
"possible paths must have a return. E.g., if you have a ``return`` inside an "
"``if`` block but not after it, the editor will raise an error because if the "
"block is not executed, the function won't have a valid value to return."
msgstr ""

msgid "Referencing functions"
msgstr "Funktioihin viittaminen"

msgid ""
"Contrary to Python, functions are *not* first-class objects in GDScript. "
"This means they cannot be stored in variables, passed as an argument to "
"another function or be returned from other functions. This is for "
"performance reasons."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To reference a function by name at run-time, (e.g. to store it in a "

msgid "Static functions"

"A function can be declared static. When a function is static, it has no "

"Simple conditions are created by using the ``if``/``else``/``elif`` syntax. "
