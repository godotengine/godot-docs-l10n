"The rooms and portals system is an optional component of Godot that allows "
"you to partition your 3D game levels into a series of :ref:"
"`Room<class_Room>` s (*aka cells*), and :ref:`Portal<class_Portal>` s. "
"Portals are openings between the rooms that the :ref:`Camera<class_Camera>` "
"(and lights) can see through."

"Godot portals should not be confused with those in the `game of the same "

"warp space, they simply represent a window that the camera (or lights) can "

"If you are \"kit bashing\" and reusing rooms or areas already, this is an "

"Finally, if you are manually creating freeform levels, bear in mind there "
"are absolutely no rules as to how far you go with portalling. Even if you "
"separate a large game level into only two rooms, with a single portal "
"between them, this can still result in relatively large performance gains."

"The performance benefits (especially in terms of occlusion) follow an L-"

"It gives you great power as a game designer, but the trade off is that it "
"requires a very technical approach to level design. It is aimed at producing "
"professional-grade results, and assumes the user is prepared to put in the "
"work for this. It is not intended to be used for all 3D games. Not all games "
"will significantly benefit from portals, and it may require more time than a "
"short game jam allows."
