"Some developers like using the command line extensively. Godot is designed "
"to be friendly to them, so here are the steps for working entirely from the "
"command line. Given the engine relies on almost no external libraries, "
"initialization times are pretty fast, making it suitable for this workflow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows and Linux, you can run a Godot binary in a terminal by specifying "
"its relative or absolute path."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On macOS, the process is different due to Godot being contained within an ``."
"app`` bundle (which is a *folder*, not a file). To run a Godot binary from a "
"terminal on macOS, you have to ``cd`` to the folder where the Godot "
"application bundle is located, then run ``Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`` "
"followed by any command line arguments. If you've renamed the application "
"bundle from ``Godot`` to another name, make sure to edit this command line "
"accordingly."

msgid "Erasing a scene"

"files. Use ``rm`` to erase a scene file. Make sure nothing references that "
"scene or else an error will be thrown upon opening."

"line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Debugging"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Catching errors in the command line can be a difficult task because they "
"just fly by. For this, a command line debugger is provided by adding ``-d``. "
"It works for running either the game or a simple scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exporting"
msgstr "Vienti"

msgid ""
"Exporting the project from the command line is also supported. This is "
"especially useful for continuous integration setups. The version of Godot "
"that is headless (server build, no video) is ideal for this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The preset name must match the name of an export preset defined in the "
"project's ``export_presets.cfg`` file. If the preset name contains spaces or "
"special characters (such as \"Windows Desktop\"), it must be surrounded with "
"quotes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To export a debug version of the game, use the ``--export-debug`` switch "
"instead of ``--export``. Their parameters and usage are the same."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To export only a PCK file, use the ``--export-pack`` option followed by the "
"preset name and output path, with the file extension, instead of ``--"
"export``. The output path extension determines the package's format, either "
"PCK or ZIP."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When specifying a relative path as the path for `--export`, `--export-debug` "
"or `--export-pack`, the path will be relative to the directory containing "
"the ``project.godot`` file, **not** relative to the current working "
"directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running a script"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to run a simple ``.gd`` script from the command line. This "
"feature is especially useful in large projects, e.g. for batch conversion of "
"assets or custom import/export."
msgstr ""

msgid "The script must inherit from ``SceneTree`` or ``MainLoop``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is a simple ``sayhello.gd`` example of how it works:"
msgstr ""

msgid "And how to run it:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no ``project.godot`` exists at the path, current path is assumed to be "
"the current working directory (unless ``--path`` is specified)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first line of ``sayhello.gd`` above is commonly referred to as a "
"*shebang*. If the Godot binary is in your ``PATH`` as ``godot``, it allows "
"you to run the script as follows in modern Linux distributions, as well as "
"macOS:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the above doesn't work in your current version of Linux or macOS, you can "
"always have the shebang run Godot straight from where it is located as "
"follows:"
