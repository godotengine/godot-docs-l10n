msgid "Project organization"
msgstr ""

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Johdanto"

msgid ""
"Since Godot has no restrictions on project structure or filesystem usage, "
"organizing files when learning the engine can seem challenging. This "
"tutorial suggests a workflow which should be a good starting point. We will "
"also cover using version control with Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid "Organization"
msgstr "Järjestys"

msgid ""
"Godot is scene-based in nature, and uses the filesystem as-is, without "
"metadata or an asset database."
msgstr ""
"Godot on luonnostaan skene-pohjainen ja käyttää tiedostojärjestelmää "
"sellaisenaan ilman metadataa tai asset-tietokantaa."

msgid ""
"Unlike other engines, many resources are contained within the scene itself, "
"so the amount of files in the filesystem is considerably lower."
msgstr ""
"Toisin kuin muissa pelimoottoreissa, suuri osa resursseista sisältyy skeneen "
"itseensä, joten tiedostojen määrä tiedostojärjestelmässä on huomattavasti "
"alhaisempi."

msgid ""
"Considering that, the most common approach is to group assets as close to "
"scenes as possible; when a project grows, it makes it more maintainable."
msgstr ""
"Se huomioiden, yleisin lähestymistapa on ryhmitellä assetit niin lähelle "
"skenejä kuin mahdollista; kun projekti kasvaa, se on näin helpommin "
"ylläpidettävissä."

msgid ""
"As an example, one can usually place into a single folder their basic "
"assets, such as sprite images, 3D model meshes, materials, and music, etc. "
"They can then use a separate folder to store built levels that use them."
msgstr ""
"Esimerkkinä, perusassetteina toimivat spritejen kuvat, 3D-mallien meshit, "
"materiaalit, musiikit, ym. voi yleensä sijoittaa yhteen kansioon. Niistä "
"rakennetuille kentille voi taas käyttää erillistä kansiota."

msgid "Style guide"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For consistency across projects, we recommend following these guidelines:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use **snake_case** for folder and file names (with the exception of C# "
"scripts). This sidesteps case sensitivity issues that can crop up after "
"exporting a project on Windows. C# scripts are an exception to this rule, as "
"the convention is to name them after the class name which should be in "
"PascalCase."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use **PascalCase** for node names, as this matches built-in node casing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, keep third-party resources in a top-level ``addons/`` folder, "
"even if they aren't editor plugins. This makes it easier to track which "
"files are third-party. There are some exceptions to this rule; for instance, "
"if you use third-party game assets for a character, it makes more sense to "
"include them within the same folder as the character scenes and scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid "Importing"
msgstr "Tuonti"

msgid ""
"Godot versions prior to 3.0 did the import process from files outside the "
"project. While this can be useful in large projects, it resulted in an "
"organization hassle for most developers."
msgstr ""
"Ennen 3.0 versiota Godot hoiti tuontiprosessin projektin ulkopuolisista "
"tiedostoista. Vaikka tämä saattoi olla hyödyllistä isoissa projekteissa, se "
"johti useimmilla kehittäjillä järjestämisen sekamelskaan."

msgid ""
"Because of this, assets are now transparently imported from within the "
"project folder."
msgstr "Tästä syystä assetit tuodaan nykyään läpinäkyvästi projektikansiosta."

msgid "Ignoring specific folders"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To prevent Godot from importing files contained in a specific folder, create "
"an empty file called ``.gdignore`` in the folder (the leading ``.`` is "
"required). This can be useful to speed up the initial project importing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a file whose name starts with a dot on Windows, you can use a text "
"editor such as Notepad++ or use the following command in a command prompt: "
"``type nul > .gdignore``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the folder is ignored, resources in that folder can't be loaded anymore "
"using the ``load()`` and ``preload()`` methods. Ignoring a folder will also "
"automatically hide it from the FileSystem dock, which can be useful to "
"reduce clutter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the ``.gdignore`` file's contents are ignored, which is why the "
"file should be empty. It does not support patterns like ``.gitignore`` files "
"do."
msgstr ""

msgid "Case sensitivity"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Windows and recent macOS versions use case-insensitive filesystems by "
"default, whereas Linux distributions use a case-sensitive filesystem by "
"default. This can cause issues after exporting a project, since Godot's PCK "
"virtual filesystem is case-sensitive. To avoid this, it's recommended to "
"stick to ``snake_case`` naming for all files in the project (and lowercase "
"characters in general)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can break this rule when style guides say otherwise (such as the C# "
"style guide). Still, be consistent to avoid mistakes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows 10, to further avoid mistakes related to case sensitivity, you "
"can also make the project folder case-sensitive. After enabling the Windows "
"Subsystem for Linux feature, run the following command in a PowerShell "
"window::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you haven't enabled the Windows Subsystem for Linux, you can enter the "
"following line in a PowerShell window *running as Administrator* then reboot "
"when asked::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "Käännöksen tila"
