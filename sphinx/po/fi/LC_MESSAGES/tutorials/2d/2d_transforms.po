msgid ""
"This is an overview of the 2D transforms going on for nodes from the moment "
"they draw their content locally to the time they are drawn onto the screen. "
"This overview discusses very low level details of the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid "Canvas transform"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the previous tutorial, :ref:`doc_canvas_layers`, every "
"CanvasItem node (remember that Node2D and Control based nodes use CanvasItem "
"as their common root) will reside in a *Canvas Layer*. Every canvas layer "
"has a transform (translation, rotation, scale, etc.) that can be accessed as "
"a :ref:`Transform2D <class_Transform2D>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also covered in the previous tutorial, nodes are drawn by default in Layer "
"0, in the built-in canvas. To put nodes in a different layer, a :ref:"
"`CanvasLayer <class_CanvasLayer>` node can be used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Global canvas transform"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Viewports also have a Global Canvas transform (also a :ref:`Transform2D "
"<class_Transform2D>`). This is the master transform and affects all "
"individual *Canvas Layer* transforms. Generally, this transform is not of "
"much use, but is used in the CanvasItem Editor in Godot's editor."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stretch transform"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, viewports have a *Stretch Transform*, which is used when resizing "
"or stretching the screen. This transform is used internally (as described "
"in :ref:`doc_multiple_resolutions`), but can also be manually set on each "
"viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Input events received in the :ref:`MainLoop._input_event() "
"<class_MainLoop_method__input_event>` callback are multiplied by this "
"transform but lack the ones above. To convert InputEvent coordinates to "
"local CanvasItem coordinates, the :ref:`CanvasItem.make_input_local() "
"<class_CanvasItem_method_make_input_local>` function was added for "
"convenience."
msgstr ""

msgid "Transform order"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a coordinate in CanvasItem local properties to become an actual screen "
"coordinate, the following chain of transforms must be applied:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Transform functions"
msgstr ""

msgid "Obtaining each transform can be achieved with the following functions:"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`CanvasItem.get_viewport_transform() "
"<class_CanvasItem_method_get_viewport_transform>`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, then, to convert a CanvasItem local coordinates to screen "
"coordinates, just multiply in the following order:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind, however, that it is generally not desired to work with screen "
"coordinates. The recommended approach is to simply work in Canvas "
"coordinates (``CanvasItem.get_global_transform()``), to allow automatic "
"screen resolution resizing to work properly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Feeding custom input events"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is often desired to feed custom input events to the scene tree. With the "
"above knowledge, to correctly do this, it must be done the following way:"
