msgid ""
"This is an overview of the 2D transforms going on for nodes from the moment "
"they draw their content locally to the time they are drawn onto the screen. "
"This overview discusses very low level details of the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid "Canvas transform"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the previous tutorial, :ref:`doc_canvas_layers`, every "
"CanvasItem node (remember that Node2D and Control based nodes use CanvasItem "
"as their common root) will reside in a *Canvas Layer*. Every canvas layer "
"has a transform (translation, rotation, scale, etc.) that can be accessed as "
"a :ref:`Transform2D <class_Transform2D>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also covered in the previous tutorial, nodes are drawn by default in Layer "
"0, in the built-in canvas. To put nodes in a different layer, a :ref:"
"`CanvasLayer <class_CanvasLayer>` node can be used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Global canvas transform"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Viewports also have a Global Canvas transform (also a :ref:`Transform2D "
"<class_Transform2D>`). This is the master transform and affects all "
"individual *Canvas Layer* transforms. Generally, this transform is not of "
"much use, but is used in the CanvasItem Editor in Godot's editor."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stretch transform"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, viewports have a *Stretch Transform*, which is used when resizing "
"or stretching the screen. This transform is used internally (as described "
"in :ref:`doc_multiple_resolutions`), but can also be manually set on each "
"viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Input events received in the :ref:`MainLoop._input_event() "
"<class_MainLoop_method__input_event>` callback are multiplied by this "
"transform but lack the ones above. To convert InputEvent coordinates to "
"local CanvasItem coordinates, the :ref:`CanvasItem.make_input_local() "
"<class_CanvasItem_method_make_input_local>` function was added for "
"convenience."
msgstr ""

msgid "Transform order"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a coordinate in CanvasItem local properties to become an actual screen "
"coordinate, the following chain of transforms must be applied:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Transform functions"

msgid "Obtaining each transform can be achieved with the following functions:"

msgid ""
"Finally, then, to convert a CanvasItem local coordinates to screen "
"coordinates, just multiply in the following order:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind, however, that it is generally not desired to work with screen "
"coordinates. The recommended approach is to simply work in Canvas "
"coordinates (``CanvasItem.get_global_transform()``), to allow automatic "
"screen resolution resizing to work properly."

msgid "Feeding custom input events"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is often desired to feed custom input events to the scene tree. With the "
"above knowledge, to correctly do this, it must be done the following way:"
