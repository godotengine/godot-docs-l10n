"This plugin can be used to export Blender scenes in a Godot-specific scene "
"format called ESCN, which is similar to TSCN (text format) but will be "
"imported as binary SCN for performance."

"Sometimes you don't want some objects exported (e.g. high-res models used "
"for baking). An object will not be exported if it is not rendered in the "
"scene. This can be set in the outliner:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Objects hidden in the viewport will be exported, but will be hidden in the "
"Godot scene."

msgid ""
"If you have hundreds of model files, you don't want your artists to waste "
"time manually exporting their blend files. To combat this, the exporter "
"provides a python function ``io_scene_godot.export(out_file_path)`` that can "
"be called to export a file. This allows easy integration with other build "
"systems. An example Makefile and python script that exports all the blends "
"in a directory are present in the Godot-Blender-exporter repository."
