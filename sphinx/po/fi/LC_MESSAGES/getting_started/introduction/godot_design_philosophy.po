msgid "Godot's design philosophy"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now that you've gotten your feet wet, let's talk about Godot's design."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Every game engine is different and fits different needs.** Not only do "
"they offer a range of features, but the design of each engine is unique. "
"This leads to different workflows and different ways to form your games' "
"structures. This all stems from their respective design philosophies."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This page is here to help you understand how Godot works, starting with some "
"of its core pillars. It is not a list of available features, nor is it an "
"engine comparison. To know if any engine can be a good fit for your project, "
"you need to try it out for yourself and understand its design and "
"limitations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please watch `Godot explained in 5 minutes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?"
"v=KjX5llYZ5eQ>`_ if you're looking for an overview of the engine's features."
msgstr ""

msgid "Object-oriented design and composition"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot embraces object-oriented design at its core with its flexible scene "
"system and Node hierarchy. It tries to stay away from strict programming "
"patterns to offer an intuitive way to structure your game."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For one, Godot lets you **compose or aggregate** scenes. It's like nested "
"prefabs: you can create a BlinkingLight scene and a BrokenLantern scene that "
"uses the BlinkingLight. Then, create a city filled with BrokenLanterns. "
"Change the BlinkingLight's color, save, and all the BrokenLanterns in the "
"city will update instantly."
msgstr ""

msgid "On top of that, you can **inherit** from any scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Godot scene could be a Weapon, a Character, an Item, a Door, a Level, part "
"of a level… anything you'd like. It works like a class in pure code, except "
"you're free to design it by using the editor, using only the code, or mixing "
"and matching the two."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's different from prefabs you find in several 3D engines, as you can then "
"inherit from and extend those scenes. You may create a Magician that extends "
"your Character. Modify the Character in the editor and the Magician will "
"update as well. It helps you build your projects so that their structure "
"matches the game's design."

"Also note that Godot offers many different types of objects called nodes, "
"each with a specific purpose. Nodes are part of a tree and always inherit "
"from their parents up to the Node class. Although the engine does feature "
"some nodes like collision shapes that a parent physics body will use, most "
"nodes work independently from one another."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In other words, Godot's nodes do not work like components in some other game "
"engines."

"Sprite is a Node2D, a CanvasItem and a Node. It has all the properties and "
"features of its three parent classes, like transforms or the ability to draw "
"custom shapes and render with a custom shader."
msgstr ""

msgid "All-inclusive package"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot tries to provide its own tools to answer most common needs. It has a "
"dedicated scripting workspace, an animation editor, a tilemap editor, a "
"shader editor, a debugger, a profiler, the ability to hot-reload locally and "
"on remote devices, etc."

"The goal is to offer a full package to create games and a continuous user "
"experience. You can still work with external programs as long as there is an "
"import plugin for it. Or you can create one, like the `Tiled Map Importer "
"<https://github.com/vnen/godot-tiled-importer>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is also partly why Godot offers its own programming languages GDScript "
"and VisualScript, along with C#. They're designed for the needs of game "
"developers and game designers, and they're tightly integrated in the engine "
"and the editor."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"GDScript lets you write code using an indentation-based syntax, yet it "
"detects types and offers a static language's quality of auto-completion. It "
"is also optimized for gameplay code with built-in types like Vectors and "
"Colors."
msgstr ""
"GDScript antaa sinun kirjoittaa yksinkertaista Pythonin kaltaista koodia, "
"kuitenkin tunnistaen tyypit ja tarjoten staattisen kielen "
"automaattitäydennyksen tason. Se on myös optimoitu pelikoodille, joka "
"käyttää Vector ja Color kaltaisia valmiita tyyppejä."

msgid ""
"Note that with GDNative, you can write high-performance code using compiled "
"languages like C, C++, Rust, or Python (using the Cython compiler) without "
"recompiling the engine."

"*VisualScript is a node-based programming language that integrates well in "
"the editor. You can drag and drop nodes or resources into the graph to "
"create new code blocks.*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the 3D workspace doesn't feature as many tools as the 2D "
"workspace. You'll need external programs or add-ons to edit terrains, "
"animate complex characters, and so on. Godot provides a complete API to "
"extend the editor's functionality using game code. See `The Godot editor is "
"a Godot game`_ below."

"*A State Machine editor plugin in Godot 2 by kubecz3k. It lets you manage "
"states and transitions visually.*"
msgstr ""

msgid "Open source"
msgstr "Avoin lähdekoodi"

msgid ""
"Godot offers a fully open source codebase under the **MIT license**. This "
"means all the technologies that ship with it have to be Free (as in freedom) "
"as well. For the most part, they're developed from the ground up by "
"contributors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Anyone can plug in proprietary tools for the needs of their projects — they "
"just won't ship with the engine. This may include Google AdMob, or FMOD. Any "
"of these can come as third-party plugins instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the other hand, an open codebase means you can **learn from and extend "
"the engine** to your heart's content. You can also debug games easily, as "
"Godot will print errors with a stack trace, even if they come from the "
"engine itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This **does not affect the work you do with Godot** in any way: there's no "
"strings attached to the engine or anything you make with it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Community-driven"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Godot is made by its community, for the community, and for all game "
"creators out there.** It's the needs of the users and open discussions that "
"drive the core updates. New features from the core developers often focus on "
"what will benefit the most users first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That said, although a handful of core developers work on it full-time, the "
"project has over 600 contributors at the time of writing. Benevolent "
"programmers work on features they may need themselves, so you'll see "
"improvements in all corners of the engine at the same time in every major "
"release."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Godot editor is a Godot game"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Godot editor runs on the game engine. It uses the engine's own UI "
"system, it can hot-reload code and scenes when you test your projects, or "
"run game code in the editor. This means you can **use the same code** and "
"scenes for your games, or **build plugins and extend the editor.**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This leads to a reliable and flexible UI system, as it powers the editor "
"itself. With the ``tool`` keyword, you can run any game code in the editor."

"*RPG in a Box is a voxel RPG editor made with Godot 2. It uses Godot's UI "
"tools for its node-based programming system and for the rest of the "
"interface.*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Put the ``tool`` keyword at the top of any GDScript file and it will run in "
"the editor. This lets you import and export plugins, create plugins like "
"custom level editors, or create scripts with the same nodes and API you use "
"in your projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The editor is fully written in C++ and is statically compiled into the "
"binary. This means you can't import it as a typical project that would have "
"a ``project.godot`` file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Separate 2D and 3D engines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot offers dedicated 2D and 3D rendering engines. As a result, **the base "
"unit for 2D scenes is pixels.** Even though the engines are separate, you "
"can render 2D in 3D, 3D in 2D, and overlay 2D sprites and interfaces over "
"your 3D world."
