"This lesson will give you an overview of the available scripting languages "
"in Godot. You will learn the pros and cons of each option. In the next part, "
"you will write your first script using GDScript."

"**Scripts attach to a node and extend its behavior**. This means that "
"scripts inherit all functions and properties of the node they attach to."

"For example, take a game where a Camera2D node follows a ship. The Camera2D "
"node follows its parent by default. Imagine you want the camera to shake "
"when the player takes damage. As this feature is not built into Godot, you "
"would attach a script to the Camera2D node and code the shake."

"Godot offers **five gameplay programming languages**: GDScript, C#, "
"VisualScript, and, via its GDNative technology, C and C++. There are more :"
"ref:`community-supported languages "
"<doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, but these are the official "
"ones."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use multiple languages in a single project. For instance, in a team, "
"you could code gameplay logic in GDScript as it's fast to write, let level "
"designers script quests in the graphical language VisualScript, and use C# "
"or C++ to implement complex algorithms and maximize their performance. Or "
"you can write everything in GDScript or C#. It's your call."

"`Godot 4.0 will remove VisualScript from core entirely. <https://godotengine."

"Future Godot 4.x releases may have VisualScript reimplemented as an "

msgid ""
"If you're a beginner, we recommend to **start with GDScript**. We made this "
"language specifically for Godot and the needs of game developers. It has a "
"lightweight and straightforward syntax and provides the tightest integration "
"with Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For C#, you will need an external code editor like `VSCode <https://code."
"visualstudio.com/>`_ or Visual Studio. While C# support is now mature, you "
"will find fewer learning resources for it compared to GDScript. That's why "
"we recommend C# mainly to users who already have experience with the "
"language."

"GDScript looks like Python as you structure your code blocks using "
