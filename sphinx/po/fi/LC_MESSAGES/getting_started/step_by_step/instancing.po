"In the previous part, we saw that a scene is a collection of nodes organized "
"in a tree structure, with a single node as its root. You can split your "
"project into any number of scenes. This feature helps you break down and "
"organize your game's different components."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create as many scenes as you'd like and save them as files with the "
"``.tscn`` extension, which stands for \"text scene\". The ``Label.tscn`` "
"file from the previous lesson was an example. We call those files \"Packed "
"Scenes\" as they pack information about your scene's content."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here's an example of a ball. It's composed of a :ref:`RigidBody2D "
"<class_RigidBody2D>` node as its root named Ball, which allows the ball to "
"fall and bounce on walls, a :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` node, and a :ref:"
"`CollisionShape2D <class_CollisionShape2D>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you saved a scene, it works as a blueprint: you can reproduce it in "
"other scenes as many times as you'd like. Replicating an object from a "
"template like this is called **instancing**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As we mentioned in the previous part, instanced scenes behave like a node: "
"the editor hides their content by default. When you instance the Ball, you "
"only see the Ball node. Notice also how each duplicate has a unique name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every instance of the Ball scene starts with the same structure and "
"properties as ``Ball.tscn``. However, you can modify each independently, "
"such as changing how they bounce, how heavy they are, or any property "
"exposed by the source scene."

"Change the properties of one ball without affecting the others using the "
"Inspector."

msgid ""
"Change the default properties of every Ball by opening the ``Ball.tscn`` "
"scene and making a change to the Ball node there. Upon saving, all instances "
"of the Ball in the project will see their values update."

"Changing a property on an instance always overrides values from the "

"``2``, and pressing :kbd:`Enter`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Play the game by pressing :kbd:`F5` and notice how all balls now bounce a "
"lot more. As the Ball scene is a template for all instances, modifying it "

"Rerun the game and notice how this ball now falls much faster than the "
"others."

msgid ""
"If you change a value on the ``PhysicsMaterial`` of one instance, it will "

msgid "Scene instances as a design language"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instances and scenes in Godot offer an excellent design language, setting "
"the engine apart from others out there. We designed Godot around this "
"concept from the ground up."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We recommend dismissing architectural code patterns when making games with "
"Godot, such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Entity-Relationship diagrams. "
"Instead, you can start by imagining the elements players will see in your "
"game and structure your code around them."

"You can come up with a diagram like this for almost any type of game. Each "
"rectangle represents an entity that's visible in the game from the player's "
"perspective. The arrows tell you which scene owns which."

"Voit keksiä tämänkaltaisen kaavion melkein minkä tahansa kaltaiselle "
"pelille. Kirjoita ylös ne pelin osat, jotka voit visualisoida, ja lisää "
"sitten nuolet kuvastamaan komponenttien omistussuhteita toisistaan."

msgid ""
"Once you have a diagram, we recommended creating a scene for each element "
"listed in it to develop your game. You'll use instancing, either by code or "
"directly in the editor, to build your tree of scenes."
msgstr ""
"Kun sinulla on tällainen kaavio, suositeltu menetelmä pelin tekemiseksi on "
"luoda skene kutakin kaaviossa lueteltua elementtiä kohden. Käytät ilmentymiä "
"(joko koodista tai suoraan editorista käsin) omistajuussuhteita varten."

msgid ""
"Programmers tend to spend a lot of time designing abstract architectures and "
"trying to fit components into it. Designing based on scenes makes "
"development faster and more straightforward, allowing you to focus on the "
"game logic itself. Because most game components map directly to a scene, "
"using a design based on scene instantiation means you need little other "
"architectural code."

"Iso osa pelien (tai ohjelmistojen ylipäänsä) ohjelmoimiseen kuluvasta ajasta "
"menee arkkitehtuurin suunnitteluun ja pelikomponenttien sovittamiseen tuohon "
"arkkitehtuuriin. Skeneihin pohjautuva suunnittelu korvaa tuon "
"lähestymistavan ja tekee kehittämisestä paljon nopeampaa ja "
"suoraviivaisempaa, antaen sinun keskittyä pelilogiikkaan itseensä. Koska "
"useimmat pelikomponentit sopivat suoraan skeneiksi, skenejen ilmentymiin "
"pohjautuvan suunnittelun käyttö tarkoittaa, että hyvin vähän muuta "
"arkkitehtuurista koodia tarvitaan."

"Imagine we started by creating the room. We could make a couple of different "
"room scenes, with unique arrangements of furniture in them. Later, we could "
"make a house scene that uses multiple room instances for the interior. We "
"would create a citadel out of many instanced houses and a large terrain on "
"which we would place the citadel. Each of these would be a scene instancing "
"one or more sub-scenes."

"Later, we could create scenes representing guards and add them to the "
"citadel. They would be indirectly added to the overall game world."

"Myöhemmin, voisimme luoda skenejä, jotka edustavat vartijoita (ja muita ei-"

"With Godot, it's easy to iterate on your game like this, as all you need to "
"do is create and instantiate more scenes. We designed the editor to be "
"accessible to programmers, designers, and artists alike. A typical team "
"development process can involve 2D or 3D artists, level designers, game "
"designers, and animators, all working with the Godot editor."
msgstr ""
"Godotin avulla on helppo iteroida peliäsi tähän tapaan, kaikki mitä sinun "
"tarvitsee tehdä on luoda uusia skenejä ja niistä ilmentymiä. Lisäksi "
