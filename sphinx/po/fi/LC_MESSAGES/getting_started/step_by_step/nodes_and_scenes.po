"In :ref:`doc_key_concepts_overview`, we saw that a Godot game is a tree of "
"scenes and that each scene is a tree of nodes. In this lesson, we explain a "
"bit more about them. You will also create your first scene."

msgid "Nodes"
msgstr "Solmut"

msgid ""
"**Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of your game**. They are like "
"the ingredients in a recipe. There are dozens of kinds that can display an "
"image, play a sound, represent a camera, and much more."
msgstr ""

msgid "All nodes have the following attributes:"
msgstr "Se tuottaa seuraavanlaisen liikkeen:"

#, fuzzy
msgid "A name."
msgstr "Toiminto"

#, fuzzy
msgid "Editable properties."
msgstr "Sillä on muokattavia ominaisuuksia."

#, fuzzy
msgid "They receive callbacks to update every frame."
msgstr ""
"Se voi saada vastakutsun (callback) käsiteltäväksi jokaisella ruudulla."

#, fuzzy
msgid "You can extend them with new properties and functions."
msgstr "Sitä voidaan laajentaa (jotta se voi saada lisää funktioita)."

#, fuzzy
msgid "You can add them to another node as a child."
msgstr "Se voidaan lisätä toisen solmun alisolmuksi."

msgid ""
"The last attribute is key. **Together, nodes form a tree**, which is a "
"powerful feature to organize projects. Since different nodes have different "
"functions, combining them produces more complex behavior. As we saw before, "
"you can build a playable character the camera follows using a kinematic body "
"node named \"Character\", a sprite node, a camera node, and a collision "
"shape node."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scenes"
msgstr "Skenet"

msgid ""
"When you organize nodes in a tree, like our character, we call this "
"construct a scene. Once saved, scenes work like new node types in the "
"editor, where you can add them as a child of an existing node. In that case, "
"the instance of the scene appears as a single node with its internals hidden."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scenes allow you to structure your game's code however you want. You can "
"**compose nodes** to create custom and complex node types, like a game "
"character that runs and jumps, a life bar, a chest with which you can "
"interact, and more."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Godot editor essentially is a **scene editor**. It has plenty of tools "
"for editing 2D and 3D scenes, as well as user interfaces. A Godot project "
"can contain as many of these scenes as you need. The engine only requires "
"one as your application's **main scene**. This is the scene Godot will first "
"load when you or a player runs the game."
msgstr ""
"Godot-editori on pohjimmiltaan ** kohtauseditori **. Siinä on paljon "
"työkaluja 2D- ja 3D-kohtausten muokkaamiseen, sekä käyttöliittymiin. Godot-"
"projekti voi sisältää niin monta näistä kohtauksista kuin tarvitset. "
"Moottori vaatii vain yhden, koska sovelluksesi **päänäkymä**. Tämä on "
"kohtaus, jonka Godot lataa ensimmäisen kerran kun sinä tai pelaaja suoritat "
"pelin."

msgid "On top of acting like nodes, scenes have the following attributes:"
msgstr ""

msgid "They always have one root node, like the \"Character\" in our example."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can save them to your hard drive and load them later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create as many instances of a scene as you'd like. You could have "
"five or ten characters in your game, created from your Character scene."

msgid "Creating your first scene"
msgstr "Lepoasennon luonti"

msgid ""
"Let's create our first scene with a single node. To do so, you will need to "
"create a new project first. After opening the project, you should see an "
"empty editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In an empty scene, the Scene dock on the left shows several options to add a "
"root node quickly. \"2D Scene\" adds a Node2D node, \"3D Scene\" adds a "
"Spatial node, and \"User Interface\" adds a Control node. These presets are "
"here for convenience; they are not mandatory. \"Other Node\" lets you select "
"any node to be the root node. In an empty scene, \"Other Node\" is "
"equivalent to pressing the \"Add Child Node\" button at the top-left of the "
"Scene dock, which usually adds a new node as a child of the currently "
"selected node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We're going to add a single Label node to our scene. Its function is to draw "
"text on the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Press the \"Add Child Node\" button or \"Other Node\" to create a root node."

msgid "The Create Node dialog opens, showing the long list of available nodes."

"voidaan luoda:"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click on the Label node to select it and click the Create button at the "
"bottom of the window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A lot happens when you add a scene's first node. The scene changes to the 2D "
"workspace because Label is a 2D node type. The Label appears, selected, in "
"the top-left corner of the viewport. The node appears in the Scene dock on "
"the left, and the node's properties appear in the Inspector dock on the "
"right."

"you to save files inside the project. The ``res://`` path at the top of the "
