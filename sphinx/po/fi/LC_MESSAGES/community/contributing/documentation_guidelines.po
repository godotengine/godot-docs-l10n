"This page describes the rules to follow if you want to contribute to Godot "
"Engine by writing or reviewing documentation, or by translating existing "
"documentation. Also, have a look at README of the `godot-docs GitHub "
"repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs>`_ and the `docs front "
"page <https://docs.godotengine.org>`_ on what steps to follow and how to "
"contact the docs team."

msgid "How to contribute"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creating or modifying documentation pages is mainly done via the `godot-docs "
"GitHub repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs>`_. The HTML "
"(or PDF and EPUB) documentation is generated from the .rst files "
"(reStructuredText markup language) in that repository. Modifying those pages "
"in a pull request and getting it merged will trigger a rebuild of the online "
"documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For details on Git usage and the pull request workflow, please refer to the :"
"ref:`doc_pr_workflow` page. Most of what it describes regarding the main "
"godotengine/godot repository is also valid for the docs repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The class reference's source files are in the `Godot engine repository "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`_. We generate the :ref:`Godot API "
"<toc-class-ref>` section of this documentation from them. If you want to "
"update the description of a class, its methods, or properties, read :ref:"
"`doc_updating_the_class_reference`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to edit the **API reference**, please note that it should *not* "
"be done in the godot-docs repository. Instead, you should edit the ``doc/"
"classes/*`` XML files of Godot's main repository. These files are then later "
"used to generate the in-editor documentation as well as the API reference of "
"the online docs. Read more here: :ref:`doc_updating_the_class_reference`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The 'Edit on GitHub' link"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're reading documentation on `docs.godotengine.org <https://docs."
"godotengine.org>`_, you'll see an **Edit on GitHub** hyperlink at the top "
"right of the page. Once you've created a GitHub account, you can propose "
"changes to a page you're reading as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Click the **Edit on GitHub** button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the GitHub page you're taken to, click the pencil icon in the top-right "
"corner near the **Raw**, **Blame** and **History** buttons. It has the "
"tooltip \"Edit the file in a fork of this project\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Complete all the edits you want to make for that page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Summarize the changes you made in the form at the bottom of the page and "
"click the button labelled **Propose file change** when done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the following screens, click the **Create pull request** button until you "
"see a message like *Username wants to merge 1 commit into godotengine:master "
"from Username:patch-6*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A reviewer will evaluate your changes and incorporate them into the docs if "
"they're acceptable. You might also be asked to make modifications to your "
"changes before they're included."
msgstr ""

msgid "What makes good documentation?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Documentation should be well written in plain English, using well-formed "
"sentences and various levels of sections and subsections. It should be clear "
"and objective. Also, have a look at the :ref:`doc_docs_writing_guidelines`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We differentiate tutorial pages from other documentation pages by these "
"definitions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tutorial: a page aiming at explaining how to use one or more concepts in the "
"editor or scripts in order to achieve a specific goal with a learning "
"purpose (e.g. \"Making a simple 2d Pong game\", \"Applying forces to an "
"object\")."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Documentation: a page describing precisely one and only one concept at a "
"time, if possible exhaustively (e.g. the list of methods of the Sprite "
"class, or an overview of the input management in Godot)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You are free to write the kind of documentation you wish, as long as you "
"respect the following rules (and the ones on the repo)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Titles"
msgstr ""

msgid "Always begin pages with their title and a Sphinx reference name:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The reference allows linking to this page using the ``:ref:`` format, e.g. "
"``:ref:`doc_insert_your_title_here``` would link to the above example page "
"(note the lack of leading underscore in the reference)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, avoid American CamelCase titles: title's first word should begin with "
"a capitalized letter, and every following word should not. Thus, this is a "
"good example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Insert your title here"
msgstr ""

msgid "And this is a bad example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Insert Your Title Here"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only project, people and node class names should have capitalized first "
"letter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translating existing pages"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can help to translate the official Godot documentation on our `Hosted "
"Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/godot-engine/>`_."
