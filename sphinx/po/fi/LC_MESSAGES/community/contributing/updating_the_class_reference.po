"In the class reference, some methods, variables, and signals lack "

"**Important:** If you plan to make large changes, you should create an issue "
"on the `godot-docs repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/>`_ "
"or comment on an existing issue. Doing so lets others know you're already "
"taking care of a given class."
