"In the center is the **search bar + settings** section, and the **assets** "

"a host of criteria. These include the asset **category** (such as 2D tools, "
"scripts and demos), **engine version** they are intended for, **sorting "
"order** (by update date, by name, etc.) and **support level**."

"While most other filter settings should be fairly self-explanatory, it's "
"worth going over what \"support level\" means in the Asset Library. "
"Currently there are three support levels, and each asset can belong to only "

"**Official** assets are created and maintained by the official Godot Engine "
