"This tutorial is about advanced skinning of an user interface. Most games "
"generally don't need this, as they end up just relying on :ref:`Label "

"<class_TextureButton>` and :ref:`TextureProgress <class_TextureProgress>`."

"However, many types of games often need complex user interfaces, like MMOs, "
"traditional RPGs, Simulators, Strategy, etc. These kind of interfaces are "

"The GUI is skinned through the :ref:`Theme <class_Theme>` resource. Theme "
"contains all the information required to change the entire visual styling of "
"all controls. Theme options are named, so it's not obvious which name "
"changes what (especially from code), but several tools are provided. The "
"ultimate place to look at what each theme option is for each control, which "
"will always be more up to date than any documentation is the file `scene/"
"resources/default_theme/default_theme.cpp <https://github.com/godotengine/"
"godot/blob/master/scene/resources/default_theme/default_theme.cpp>`__. The "
"rest of this document will explain the different tools used to customize the "
"theme."

"A Theme can be applied to any control in the scene. As a result, all "
"children and grand-children controls will use that same theme too (unless "
"another theme is specified further down the tree). If a value is not found "
"in a theme, it will be searched in themes higher up in the hierarchy towards "
"the root. If nothing was found, the default theme is used. This system "
"allows for flexible overriding of themes in complex user interfaces."
