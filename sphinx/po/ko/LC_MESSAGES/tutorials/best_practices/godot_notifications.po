msgid "Godot notifications"
msgstr "알림(Notifications)"

msgid ""
"Every Object in Godot implements a :ref:`_notification "
"<class_Object_private_method__notification>` method. Its purpose is to allow "
"the Object to respond to a variety of engine-level callbacks that may relate "
"to it. For example, if the engine tells a :ref:`CanvasItem "
"<class_CanvasItem>` to \"draw\", it will call "
"``_notification(NOTIFICATION_DRAW)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of these notifications, like draw, are useful to override in scripts. "
"So much so that Godot exposes many of them with dedicated functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_ready()``: ``NOTIFICATION_READY``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_enter_tree()``: ``NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_exit_tree()``: ``NOTIFICATION_EXIT_TREE``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_process(delta)``: ``NOTIFICATION_PROCESS``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_physics_process(delta)``: ``NOTIFICATION_PHYSICS_PROCESS``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_draw()``: ``NOTIFICATION_DRAW``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What users might *not* realize is that notifications exist for types other "
"than Node alone, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Object::NOTIFICATION_POSTINITIALIZE "
"<class_Object_constant_NOTIFICATION_POSTINITIALIZE>`: a callback that "
"triggers during object initialization. Not accessible to scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Object::NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE "
"<class_Object_constant_NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE>`: a callback that triggers "
"before the engine deletes an Object, i.e. a \"destructor\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And many of the callbacks that *do* exist in Nodes don't have any dedicated "
"methods, but are still quite useful."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Node::NOTIFICATION_PARENTED "
"<class_Node_constant_NOTIFICATION_PARENTED>`: a callback that triggers "
"anytime one adds a child node to another node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Node::NOTIFICATION_UNPARENTED "
"<class_Node_constant_NOTIFICATION_UNPARENTED>`: a callback that triggers "
"anytime one removes a child node from another node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One can access all these custom notifications from the universal "
"``_notification()`` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Methods in the documentation labeled as \"virtual\" are also intended to be "
"overridden by scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A classic example is the :ref:`_init <class_Object_private_method__init>` "
"method in Object. While it has no ``NOTIFICATION_*`` equivalent, the engine "
"still calls the method. Most languages (except C#) rely on it as a "
"constructor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So, in which situation should one use each of these notifications or virtual "
"functions?"
msgstr ""

msgid "_process vs. _physics_process vs. \\*_input"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``_process()`` when one needs a framerate-dependent delta time between "
"frames. If code that updates object data needs to update as often as "
"possible, this is the right place. Recurring logic checks and data caching "
"often execute here, but it comes down to the frequency at which one needs "
"the evaluations to update. If they don't need to execute every frame, then "
"implementing a Timer-timeout loop is another option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``_physics_process()`` when one needs a framerate-independent delta time "
"between frames. If code needs consistent updates over time, regardless of "
"how fast or slow time advances, this is the right place. Recurring kinematic "
"and object transform operations should execute here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While it is possible, to achieve the best performance, one should avoid "
"making input checks during these callbacks. ``_process()`` and "
"``_physics_process()`` will trigger at every opportunity (they do not "
"\"rest\" by default). In contrast, ``*_input()`` callbacks will trigger only "
"on frames in which the engine has actually detected the input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One can check for input actions within the input callbacks just the same. If "
"one wants to use delta time, one can fetch it from the related delta time "
"methods as needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "_init vs. initialization vs. export"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the script initializes its own node subtree, without a scene, that code "
"should execute in ``_init()``. Other property or SceneTree-independent "
"initializations should also run here."
msgstr ""

msgid "The C# equivalent to GDScript's ``_init()`` method is the constructor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``_init()`` triggers before ``_enter_tree()`` or ``_ready()``, but after a "
"script creates and initializes its properties. When instantiating a scene, "
"property values will set up according to the following sequence:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Initial value assignment:** the property is assigned its initialization "
"value, or its default value if one is not specified. If a setter exists, it "
"is not used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**``_init()`` assignment:** the property's value is replaced by any "
"assignments made in ``_init()``, triggering the setter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Exported value assignment:** an exported property's value is again "
"replaced by any value set in the Inspector, triggering the setter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, instantiating a script versus a scene may affect both the "
"initialization *and* the number of times the engine calls the setter."
msgstr ""

msgid "_ready vs. _enter_tree vs. NOTIFICATION_PARENTED"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When instantiating a scene connected to the first executed scene, Godot will "
"instantiate nodes down the tree (making ``_init()`` calls) and build the "
"tree going downwards from the root. This causes ``_enter_tree()`` calls to "
"cascade down the tree. Once the tree is complete, leaf nodes call "
"``_ready``. A node will call this method once all child nodes have finished "
"calling theirs. This then causes a reverse cascade going up back to the "
"tree's root."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When instantiating a script or a standalone scene, nodes are not added to "
"the SceneTree upon creation, so no ``_enter_tree()`` callbacks trigger. "
"Instead, only the ``_init()`` call occurs. When the scene is added to the "
"SceneTree, the ``_enter_tree()`` and ``_ready()`` calls occur."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If one needs to trigger behavior that occurs as nodes parent to another, "
"regardless of whether it occurs as part of the main/active scene or not, one "
"can use the :ref:`PARENTED <class_Node_constant_NOTIFICATION_PARENTED>` "
"notification. For example, here is a snippet that connects a node's method "
"to a custom signal on the parent node without failing. Useful on data-"
"centric nodes that one might create at runtime."

msgstr "번역 상태"
