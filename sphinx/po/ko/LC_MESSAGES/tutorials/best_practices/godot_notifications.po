msgid "Godot notifications"
msgstr "알림(Notifications)"

msgid ""
"Every Object in Godot implements a :ref:`_notification "
"<class_Object_method__notification>` method. Its purpose is to allow the "
"Object to respond to a variety of engine-level callbacks that may relate to "
"it. For example, if the engine tells a :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` "
"to \"draw\", it will call ``_notification(NOTIFICATION_DRAW)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of these notifications, like draw, are useful to override in scripts. "
"So much so that Godot exposes many of them with dedicated functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_ready()`` : NOTIFICATION_READY"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_enter_tree()`` : NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_exit_tree()`` : NOTIFICATION_EXIT_TREE"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_process(delta)`` : NOTIFICATION_PROCESS"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_physics_process(delta)`` : NOTIFICATION_PHYSICS_PROCESS"
msgstr ""

msgid "``_draw()`` : NOTIFICATION_DRAW"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What users might *not* realize is that notifications exist for types other "
"than Node alone:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Object::NOTIFICATION_POSTINITIALIZE "
"<class_Object_constant_NOTIFICATION_POSTINITIALIZE>`: a callback that "
"triggers during object initialization. Not accessible to scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Object::NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE "
"<class_Object_constant_NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE>`: a callback that triggers "
"before the engine deletes an Object, i.e. a 'destructor'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`MainLoop::NOTIFICATION_WM_MOUSE_ENTER "
"<class_MainLoop_constant_NOTIFICATION_WM_MOUSE_ENTER>`: a callback that "
"triggers when the mouse enters the window in the operating system that "
"displays the game content."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And many of the callbacks that *do* exist in Nodes don't have any dedicated "
"methods, but are still quite useful."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Node::NOTIFICATION_PARENTED "
"<class_Node_constant_NOTIFICATION_PARENTED>`: a callback that triggers "
"anytime one adds a child node to another node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Node::NOTIFICATION_UNPARENTED "
"<class_Node_constant_NOTIFICATION_UNPARENTED>`: a callback that triggers "
"anytime one removes a child node from another node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Popup::NOTIFICATION_POST_POPUP "
"<class_Popup_constant_NOTIFICATION_POST_POPUP>`: a callback that triggers "
"after a Popup node completes any ``popup*`` method. Note the difference from "
"its ``about_to_show`` signal which triggers *before* its appearance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One can access all these custom notifications from the universal "
"``_notification`` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Methods in the documentation labeled as \"virtual\" are also intended to be "
"overridden by scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A classic example is the :ref:`_init <class_Object_method__init>` method in "
"Object. While it has no ``NOTIFICATION_*`` equivalent, the engine still "
"calls the method. Most languages (except C#) rely on it as a constructor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So, in which situation should one use each of these notifications or virtual "
"functions?"
msgstr ""

msgid "_process vs. _physics_process vs. \\*_input"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``_process`` when one needs a framerate-dependent deltatime between "
"frames. If code that updates object data needs to update as often as "
"possible, this is the right place. Recurring logic checks and data caching "
"often execute here, but it comes down to the frequency at which one needs "
"the evaluations to update. If they don't need to execute every frame, then "
"implementing a Timer-yield-timeout loop is another option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``_physics_process`` when one needs a framerate-independent deltatime "
"between frames. If code needs consistent updates over time, regardless of "
"how fast or slow time advances, this is the right place. Recurring kinematic "
"and object transform operations should execute here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While it is possible, to achieve the best performance, one should avoid "
"making input checks during these callbacks. ``_process`` and "
"``_physics_process`` will trigger at every opportunity (they do not \"rest\" "
"by default). In contrast, ``*_input`` callbacks will trigger only on frames "
"in which the engine has actually detected the input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One can check for input actions within the input callbacks just the same. If "
"one wants to use delta time, one can fetch it from the related deltatime "
"methods as needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "_init vs. initialization vs. export"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the script initializes its own node subtree, without a scene, that code "
"should execute here. Other property or SceneTree-independent initializations "
"should also run here. This triggers before ``_ready`` or ``_enter_tree``, "
"but after a script creates and initializes its properties."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scripts have three types of property assignments that can occur during "
"instantiation:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When instantiating a scene, property values will set up according to the "
"following sequence:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Initial value assignment:** instantiation will assign either the "
"initialization value or the init assignment value. Init assignments take "
"priority over initialization values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Exported value assignment:** If instancing from a scene rather than a "
"script, Godot will assign the exported value to replace the initial value "
"defined in the script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, instantiating a script versus a scene will affect both the "
"initialization *and* the number of times the engine calls the setter."
msgstr ""

msgid "_ready vs. _enter_tree vs. NOTIFICATION_PARENTED"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When instantiating a scene connected to the first executed scene, Godot will "
"instantiate nodes down the tree (making ``_init`` calls) and build the tree "
"going downwards from the root. This causes ``_enter_tree`` calls to cascade "
"down the tree. Once the tree is complete, leaf nodes call ``_ready``. A node "
"will call this method once all child nodes have finished calling theirs. "
"This then causes a reverse cascade going up back to the tree's root."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When instantiating a script or a standalone scene, nodes are not added to "
"the SceneTree upon creation, so no ``_enter_tree`` callbacks trigger. "
"Instead, only the ``_init`` call occurs. When the scene is added to the "
"SceneTree, the ``_enter_tree`` and ``_ready`` calls occur."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If one needs to trigger behavior that occurs as nodes parent to another, "
"regardless of whether it occurs as part of the main/active scene or not, one "
"can use the :ref:`PARENTED <class_Node_constant_NOTIFICATION_PARENTED>` "
"notification. For example, here is a snippet that connects a node's method "
"to a custom signal on the parent node without failing. Useful on data-"
"centric nodes that one might create at runtime."

msgstr "번역 상태"
