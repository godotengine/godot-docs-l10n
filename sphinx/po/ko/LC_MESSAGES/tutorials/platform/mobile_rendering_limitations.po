"To improve out-of-the-box performance on mobile devices, Godot automatically "
"uses low-end-friendly settings by default on both Android and iOS. These are "
"configured by project settings with a ``.mobile`` :ref:`feature tag "
"<doc_feature_tags>` suffix."

msgid ""
"One of the most notable changes on mobile that will affect 3D projects is "
"that lighting is done per-vertex instead of per-pixel. This improves "
"performance a lot, but can break rendering in some scenes, especially if "
"your meshes aren't sufficiently subdivided for per-vertex lighting to look "
"good. This can be disabled in the Project Settings at a performance cost "
"(see below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using GLES2, some custom shaders may break when exporting to Android. "
"This is caused by a lower shader precision being used by default to improve "
"performance. You can force high precision on all shader computations by "
"enabling ``rendering/gles2/compatibility/enable_high_float.Android`` project "
"setting, but this has a significant performance cost and won't work on all "
"devices."
