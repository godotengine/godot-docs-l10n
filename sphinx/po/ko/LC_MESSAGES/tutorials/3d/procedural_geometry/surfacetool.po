msgid "Using the SurfaceTool"
msgstr "결과 시험하기"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`SurfaceTool <class_surfacetool>` provides a useful interface for "
"constructing geometry. The interface is similar to the :ref:"
"`ImmediateGeometry <class_immediategeometry>` node. You set each per-vertex "
"attribute (e.g. normal, uv, color) and then when you add a vertex it "
"captures the attributes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The SurfaceTool also provides some useful helper functions like ``index()`` "
"and ``generate_normals()``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Attributes are added before each vertex is added:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When finished generating your geometry with the :ref:`SurfaceTool "
"<class_surfacetool>` call ``commit()`` to finish generating the mesh. If an :"
"ref:`ArrayMesh <class_ArrayMesh>` is passed to ``commit()`` then it appends "
"a new surface to the end of the ArrayMesh. While if nothing is passed in, "
"``commit()`` returns an ArrayMesh."

msgid "Code creates a triangle with indices"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can optionally add an index array, either by calling ``add_index()`` and "
"adding vertices to the index array or by calling ``index()`` which shrinks "
"the vertex array to remove duplicate vertices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, if you have an index array, but you want each vertex to be unique "
"(e.g. because you want to use unique normals or colors per face instead of "
"per-vertex), you can call ``deindex()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't add custom normals yourself, you can add them using "
"``generate_normals()``, which should be called after generating geometry and "
"before committing the mesh using ``commit()`` or ``commit_to_arrays()``. "
"Calling ``generate_normals(true)`` will flip the resulting normals. As a "
"side note, ``generate_normals()`` only works if the primitive type is set to "
"``Mesh.PRIMITIVE_TRIANGLES``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may notice that normal mapping or other material properties look broken "
"on the generated mesh. This is because normal mapping **requires** the mesh "
"to feature *tangents*, which are separate from *normals*. You can either add "
"custom tangents manually, or generate them automatically with with "
"``generate_tangents()``. This method requires that each vertex have UVs and "
"normals set already."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, when generating normals, they will be calculated on a per-face "
"basis. If you want smooth vertex normals, when adding vertices, call "
"``add_smooth_group()``. ``add_smooth_group()`` needs to be called while "
"building the geometry, e.g. before the call to ``add_vertex()`` (if non-"
"indexed) or ``add_index()`` (if indexed)."
