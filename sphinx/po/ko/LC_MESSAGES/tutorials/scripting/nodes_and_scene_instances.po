"This guide explains how to get nodes, create nodes, add them as a child, and "
"instantiate scenes from code."

msgid "Getting nodes"
msgstr "노드 만들기"

msgid ""
"You can get a reference to a node by calling the :ref:`Node.get_node() "
"<class_Node_method_get_node>` method. For this to work, the child node must "
"be present in the scene tree. Getting it in the parent node's ``_ready()`` "
"function guarantees that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If, for example,  you have a scene tree like this, and you want to get a "
"reference to the Sprite and Camera2D nodes to access them in your script."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "To do so, you can use the following code."
msgstr "인터페이스를 활성화하기 위해, 다음 코드를 실행합니다:"

msgid ""
"Note that you get nodes using their name, not their type. Above, \"Sprite\" "
"and \"Camera2D\" are the nodes' names in the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you rename the Sprite node as Skin in the Scene dock, you have to change "
"the line that gets the node to ``get_node(\"Skin\")`` in the script."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Node paths"
msgstr "노드 경로 복사"

msgid ""
"When getting a reference to a node, you're not limited to getting a direct "
"child. The ``get_node()`` function supports paths, a bit like when working "
"with a file browser. Add a slash to separate nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Take the following example scene, with the script attached to the "
"UserInterface node."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "To get the Tween node, you would use the following code."
msgstr "인터페이스를 활성화하기 위해, 다음 코드를 실행합니다:"

msgid ""
"As with file paths, you can use \"..\" to get a parent node. The best "
"practice is to avoid doing that though not to break encapsulation. You can "
"also start the path with a forward slash to make it absolute, in which case "
"your topmost node would be \"/root\", the application's predefined root "
"viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid "Syntactic sugar"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use two shorthands to shorten your code in GDScript. Firstly, "
"putting the ``onready`` keyword before a member variable makes it initialize "
"right before the ``_ready()`` callback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is also a short notation for ``get_node()``: the dollar sign, \"$\". "
"You place it before the name or path of the node you want to get."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating nodes"
msgstr "노드 만들기"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"To create a node from code, call its ``new()`` method like for any other "
"class-based datatype."
msgstr ""
"다른 클래스 기반 데이터 유형과 마찬가지로, 코드로 노드를 만들려면 ``.new()`` "
"메서드를 호출해야 합니다. 예를 들어:"

msgid ""
"You can store the newly created node's reference in a variable and call "
"``add_child()`` to add it as a child of the node to which you attached the "
"script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To delete a node and free it from memory, you can call its ``queue_free()`` "
"method. Doing so queues the node for deletion at the end of the current "
"frame after it has finished processing. At that point, the engine removes "
"the node from the scene and frees the object in memory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before calling ``sprite.queue_free()``, the remote scene tree looks like "
"this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the engine freed the node, the remote scene tree doesn't display the "
"sprite anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can alternatively call ``free()`` to immediately destroy the node. You "
"should do this with care as any reference to it will instantly become "
"``null``. We recommend using ``queue_free()`` unless you know what you're "
"doing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you free a node, it also frees all its children. Thanks to this, to "
"delete an entire branch of the scene tree, you only have to free the topmost "
"parent node."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instancing scenes"
msgstr "씬 인스턴스화하기"

msgid ""
"Scenes are templates from which you can create as many reproductions as "
"you'd like. This operation is called instancing, and doing it from code "
"happens in two steps:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Loading the scene from the hard drive."
msgstr "코드에서 리소스 불러오기"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Creating an instance of the loaded :ref:`PackedScene <class_PackedScene>` "
"resource."
msgstr ""
"씬의 인스턴스를 얻으려면 :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "
"<class_PackedScene_method_instance>` 메서드를 사용해야 합니다."

msgid ""
"Preloading the scene can improve the user's experience as the load operation "
"happens when the compiler reads the script and not at runtime. This feature "
"is only available with GDScript."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"At that point, ``scene`` is a packed scene resource, not a node. To create "
"the actual node, you need to call :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "
"<class_PackedScene_method_instance>`. It returns a tree of nodes that you "
"can as a child of your current node."
msgstr ""
"그러나 ``씬(Scene)``\\ 은 아직 노드가 아닙니다. 씬은 :ref:`PackedScene "
"<class_PackedScene>`\\ 이라는 특수 리소스에 패키징되어 있습니다. 실제 노드를 "
"만들려면 :ref:`PackedScene.instance() <class_PackedScene_method_instance>` 함"
"수를 호출해야 합니다. 그러면 PackedScene은 작동중인 씬에 추가할 수 있는 노드 "
"트리를 반환합니다:"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The advantage of this two-step process is you can keep a packed scene loaded "
"and create new instances on the fly. For example, to quickly instance "
"several enemies or bullets."
msgstr ""
"이 두 단계 처리는 PackedScene이 불러온 상태로 유지되고 언제나 사용될 준비가 "
"되어 있다는 장점이 있습니다. 이렇게 해서 인스턴스를 원하는 만큼 만들 수 있습"
"니다. 이는 특히 활성 씬에서 많은 적, 총알, 그 외 다른 개체를 신속하게 인스턴"
"스화하는 데 유용합니다."

msgstr "번역 상태"
