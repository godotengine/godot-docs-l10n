"Traditionally, `cutout animation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Cutout_animation>`__ is a type of `stop motion animation <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion>`__ in which pieces of paper (or other thin "
"material) are cut into special shapes and arranged in two-dimensional "
"representations of characters and objects. Characters' bodies are usually "
"made out of several pieces. The pieces are arranged and photographed once "
"for each frame of the film. The animator moves and rotates the parts in "
"small increments between each shot to create the illusion of movement when "
"the images are played back quickly in sequence."

msgid ""
"As an example, let's turn the right arm into a skeleton. To create a "

"Why does the hand lack a bone? In Godot, a bone connects a node with its "

msgid ""
"The first step is creating an endpoint node. Any kind of node will do, but :"
"ref:`Marker2D <class_Marker2D>` is preferred because it's visible in the "

"chains. IK chains allow for more natural control of extremities."

msgid "IK chains"
msgstr "IK 체인"

msgid ""
"IK stands for inverse kinematics. It's a convenient technique for animating "
"the position of hands, feet and other extremities of rigs like the one we've "
"made. Imagine you want to pose a character's foot in a specific position on "
"the ground. Without IK chains, each motion of the foot would require "
"rotating and positioning several other bones (the shin and the thigh at "
"least). This would be quite complex and lead to imprecise results. IK allows "
"us to move the foot directly while the shin and thigh self-adjust."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**IK chains in Godot currently work in the editor only**, not at runtime. "
"They are intended to ease the process of setting keyframes, and are not "
"currently useful for techniques like procedural animation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create an IK chain, select a chain of bones from endpoint to the base for "
"the chain. For example, to create an IK chain for the right leg, select the "
"following:"

msgid "Then enable this chain for IK. Go to Edit > Make IK Chain."

msgid ""
"The \"loc\", \"rot\", and \"scl\" toggle buttons to the left of the key "
"button modify its function, allowing you to specify which of the three "
"properties keyframes will be created for."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here's an illustration of how this can be useful: Imagine you have a node "
"which already has two keyframes animating its scale only. You want to add an "
"overlapping rotation movement to the same node. The rotation movement should "
"begin and end at different times from the scale change that's already set "
"up. You can use the toggle buttons to have only rotation information added "
"when you add a new keyframe. This way, you can avoid adding unwanted scale "
"keyframes which would disrupt the existing scale animation."

msgid "Creating a rest pose"
msgstr "프로젝트 생성하기"

msgid ""
"Think of a rest pose as a default pose that your cutout rig should be set to "

"1. Make sure the rig parts are positioned in what looks like a \"resting\" "

"5. Press the key button. Keys will be inserted for all selected parts "
"storing their current arrangement. This pose can now be recalled when "
"necessary in your game by playing the \"rest\" animation you've created."

msgid "Modifying rotation only"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When animating a cutout rig, often it's only the rotation of the nodes that "
"needs to change. Location and scale are rarely used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So when inserting keys, you might find it convenient to have only the "
"\"rot\" toggle active most of the time:"

"This will avoid the creation of unwanted animation tracks for position and "
"scale."

#, fuzzy
msgid "Keyframing IK chains"
msgstr "IK 체인"

msgid ""
"When editing IK chains, it's not necessary to select the whole chain to add "

"automatically insert keyframes for all other parts of the chain too."
msgstr ""

msgid "Visually move a sprite behind its parent"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes it is necessary to have a node change its visual depth relative to "
"its parent node during an animation. Think of a character facing the camera, "
"who pulls something out from behind his back and holds it out in front of "
"him. During this animation the whole arm and the object in his hand would "
"need to change their visual depth relative to the body of the character."

msgid ""
"To help with this there's a keyframable \"Behind Parent\" property on all "
"Node2D-inheriting nodes. When planning your rig, think about the movements "
"it will need to perform and give some thought to how you'll use \"Behind "
"Parent\" and/or RemoteTransform2D nodes. They provide overlapping "
