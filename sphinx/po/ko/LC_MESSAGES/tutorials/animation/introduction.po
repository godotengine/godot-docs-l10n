"**Capture:** If the first keyframe's time is greater than ``0.0``, the "

"Godot's animation engine doesn't stop here. If you're already comfortable "
"with Godot's scripting language :ref:`doc_gdscript` and :doc:`/classes/"
"index` you know that each node type is a class and has a bunch of callable "
"methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the :ref:`class_AudioStreamPlayer` node type has a method to "
"play an audio stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wouldn't it be great to use a method at a specific keyframe in an animation? "
"This is where \"Call Method Tracks\" come in handy. These tracks reference a "
"node again, this time without a reference to a property. Instead, a keyframe "
"holds the name and arguments of a method, that Godot should call when it "
"reaches this keyframe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To demonstrate, we're going to use a call method track to play audio at a "
"specific keyframe. Normally to play audio you should use an audio track, but "
"for the sake of demonstrating methods we're going to do it this way."
