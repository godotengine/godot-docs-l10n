"With :ref:`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>`, Godot has one of the "
"most flexible animation systems that you can find in any game engine. The "
"ability to animate pretty much any property in any node or resource, as well "
"as having dedicated transform, bezier, function calling, audio and sub-"
"animation tracks, is pretty much unique."

":ref:`AnimationTree <class_AnimationTree>` is a new node introduced in Godot "
"3.1 to deal with advanced transitions. It supersedes the ancient "

"Before starting, it must be made clear that an ``AnimationTree`` node does "
"not contain its own animations. Instead, it uses animations contained in an "
"``AnimationPlayer`` node. This way, you can edit your animations (or import "
"them from a 3D scene) as usual and then use this extra node to control the "
"playback."

"The most common way to use ``AnimationTree`` is in a 3D scene. When "
"importing your scenes from a 3D exchange format, they will usually come with "
"animations built-in (either multiple ones or split from a large one on "
"import). At the end, the imported Godot scene will contain the animations in "
"a ``AnimationPlayer`` node."

"As you rarely use imported scenes directly in Godot (they are either "
