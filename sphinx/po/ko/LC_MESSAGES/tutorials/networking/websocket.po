"The WebSocket protocol was standardized in 2011 with the original goal of "
"allowing browsers to create stable and bidirectional connections with a "
"server. Before that, browsers used to only support HTTPRequests, which is "
"not well-suited for bidirectional communication."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The protocol is message based and a very powerful tool to send push "
"notifications to browsers, and has been used to implement chats, turn-based "
"games, etc. It still uses a TCP connection, which is good for reliability "
"but not for latency, so not good for real-time applications like VoIP and "
"fast-paced games (see :ref:`WebRTC <doc_webrtc>` for those use cases)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to its simplicity, its wide compatibility, and being easier to use than "
"a raw TCP connection, WebSocket soon started to spread outside the browsers, "
"in native applications as a mean to communicate with network servers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Godot supports WebSocket in both native and HTML5 exports."

"WebSocket is implemented in Godot via :ref:`WebSocketPeer "
"<class_WebSocketPeer>`. The WebSocket implementation is compatible with the "
"High Level Multiplayer. See section on :ref:`high-level multiplayer "
"<doc_high_level_multiplayer>` for more details."
msgstr ""
"WebSocket는 Godot에서 세 가지 주요 클래스인 WebSocketClient, "
"WebSocketServer, 그리고 WebSocketPeer를 통해 구현됩니다. WebSocket 구현은 높"
"은 수준의 멀티플레이어와 호환됩니다. 자세한 내용은 `high-level multiplayer 문"
"서 <doc_high_level_multiplayer> 섹션’을 참조하십시오."

"When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the ``INTERNET`` permission "
"in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click "
"deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by "
