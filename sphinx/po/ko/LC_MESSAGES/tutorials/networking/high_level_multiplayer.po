"The following explains the differences of high- and low-level networking in "

"Godot always supported standard low-level networking via UDP, TCP and some "
"higher level protocols such as SSL and HTTP. These protocols are flexible "
"and can be used for almost anything. However, using them to synchronize game "
"state manually can be a large amount of work. Sometimes that work can't be "
"avoided or is worth it, for example when working with a custom server "
"implementation on the backend. But in most cases, it's worthwhile to "
"consider Godot's high-level networking API, which sacrifices some of the "
"fine-grained control of low-level networking for greater ease of use."
msgstr ""
"Godot는 항상 UDP, TCP, 그 외 SSL이나 HTTP와 같은 일부 하이 레벨 프로토콜을 통"
"해, 일반적인 로우 레벨 네트워킹을 지원했습니다. 이 프로토콜은 유연하고 거의 "
"모든 것에 사용될 수 있습니다. 하지만 게임 상태를 일일이 동기화하기 위해 이 프"
"로토콜을 사용하는 일은 많은 작업이 필요합니다. 때로는 그 작업이 필요하고, 가"
"치가 있습니다. 예를 들면 백엔드에서 맞춤 서버 구현을 작업할 때가 있죠. 하지"
"만, 대부분의 경우, Godot의 하이 레벨 네트워킹 API를 생각하게 만들었습니다. 쉽"
"게 쓸 수 있지만, 로우 레벨 네트워킹의 세밀한 제어를 희생하죠."

msgid "This is due to the inherent limitations of the low-level protocols:"
msgstr "이는 로우 레벨 프로토콜의 고유의 한계 때문입니다:"

msgid ""
"TCP ensures packets will always arrive reliably and in order, but latency is "
"generally higher due to error correction. It's also quite a complex protocol "
"because it understands what a \"connection\" is, and optimizes for goals "
"that often don't suit applications like multiplayer games. Packets are "
"buffered to be sent in larger batches, trading less per-packet overhead for "
"higher latency. This can be useful for things like HTTP, but generally not "
"for games. Some of this can be configured and disabled (e.g. by disabling "
"\"Nagle's algorithm\" for the TCP connection)."
msgstr ""
"TCP는 패킷(Packet)이 항상 안전하게 도착하도록 보장합니다. 하지만 오류 연결 때"
"문에 지연 시간은 점진적으로 길어집니다. 이 또한 복잡한 프로토콜입니다. 왜냐하"
"면 무엇이 \"연결(Connection)\"인지를 이해해야 하고, 멀티플레이어 게임과 같은 "
"애플리케이션과는 맞지 않은 목적을 이루기 위해 최적화를 해야 합니다. 패킷은 "
"더 큰 배치(Batch)로 전송되도록 버퍼링됩니다. 그렇게 되면 전달하는 패킷 당 오"
"버헤드(Overhead)는 줄어들고 지연 시간이 길어집니다. 이는 HTTP에는 유용하겠지"
"만, 일반적인 게임에는 아니죠. 일부 프로토콜은 이를 설정하거나 끌 수 있습니"
"다. (예: TCP 연결의 \"네이글 알고리즘(Nagle Algorithm)\"을 끔)."

msgid ""
"UDP is a simpler protocol, which only sends packets (and has no concept of a "
"\"connection\"). No error correction makes it pretty quick (low latency), "
"but packets may be lost along the way or received in the wrong order. Added "
"to that, the MTU (maximum packet size) for UDP is generally low (only a few "
"hundred bytes), so transmitting larger packets means splitting them, "
"reorganizing them and retrying if a part fails."
msgstr ""
"UDP는 더 간단한 프로토콜로, 패킷을 보내기만 합니다 (즉, \"연결"
"(Connection)\"의 개념이 없습니다). 오류 연결이 없어서 꽤 빠릅니다 (짧은 지연 "
"시간). 하지만 패킷을 보내는 과정에서 잃을 수 있고, 잘못된 상대방이 받을 수 있"
"습니다. 게다가, UDP의 MTU (최대 패킷 크기)는 (겨우 몇 백 바이트로) 보통 낮습"
"니다. 따라서 더 큰 패킷을 전송하려면 패킷을 분리하고, 다시 구조화하고, 만일 "
"일부분이 잘못되면 다시 시도해야 합니다."

msgid ""
"In general, TCP can be thought of as reliable, ordered, and slow; UDP as "
"unreliable, unordered and fast. Because of the large difference in "
"performance, it often makes sense to re-build the parts of TCP wanted for "
"games (optional reliability and packet order), while avoiding the unwanted "
"parts (congestion/traffic control features, Nagle's algorithm, etc). Due to "
"this, most game engines come with such an implementation, and Godot is no "
"exception."
msgstr ""
"보통은, TCP를 신뢰할 수 있고 질서 있고 느리다고 생각할 수 있습니다. 반대로 "
"UDP는 신뢰할 수 없고, 무질서하며, 빠르다고 생각하겠죠. 그 이유는 둘 간의 큰 "
"성능 차이입니다. 종종 게임에 필요한 TCP 부분을 새로 만드는 것이 합리적이기도 "
"합니다 (선택적인 안정성과 패킷 순서). 그러면서 원하지 않은 부분은 피할 수 있"
"으니까요 (혼잡(Congestion)/트래픽(traffic) 제어 기능, 네이글 알고리즘 등). "
"이 때문에 대부분의 게임 엔진은 이러한 네트워킹 구현을 제공합니다. Godot 역시 "
"예외가 아니죠."

msgid ""
"In summary, you can use the low-level networking API for maximum control and "
"implement everything on top of bare network protocols or use the high-level "
"API based on :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` that does most of the heavy "

msgid ""
"The ``master`` keyword on the ``exploded`` method in the player node means "
"two things for how this call is made. Firstly, from the perspective of the "

"sending the call to, the peer will only accept the call if it set itself as "

"has the ``master`` keyword). This works well as long as all peers agree on "
"who is the master of what."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above setup means that only the peer who owns the affected body will be "
"responsible for telling all the other peers that its body was stunned, after "
"being remotely instructed to do so by the host's bomb. The owning peer "
"therefore (still in the ``exploded`` method) tells all the other peers that "
"its player node was stunned. The peer does this by remotely calling the "
"``stun`` method on all instances of that player node (on the other peers). "
"Because the ``stun`` method has the ``puppet`` keyword, only peers who did "
"not set themselves as the network master of the node will call it (in other "
"words, those peers are set as puppets for that node by virtue of not being "
"the network master of it)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The result of this call to ``stun`` is to make the player look stunned on "
