"Save games can be complicated. For example, it may be desirable to store "
"information from multiple objects across multiple levels. Advanced save game "
"systems should allow for additional information about an arbitrary number of "
"objects. This will allow the save function to scale as the game grows more "
"complex."

"Firstly, we should identify what objects we want to keep between game "
"sessions and what information we want to keep from those objects. For this "
"tutorial, we will use groups to mark and handle objects to be saved, but "
"other methods are certainly possible."

"We will start by adding objects we wish to save to the \"Persist\" group. As "
"in the :ref:`doc_scripting_continued` tutorial, we can do this through "
"either the GUI or script. Let's add the relevant nodes using the GUI:"

"Once this is done, when we need to save the game, we can get all objects to "
"save them and then tell them all to save with this script:"

"The next step is to serialize the data. This makes it much easier to read "
"from and store to disk. In this case, we're assuming each member of group "
"Persist is an instanced node and thus has a path. GDScript has helper "
"functions for this, such as :ref:`to_json() "
"<class_@GDScript_method_to_json>` and :ref:`parse_json() "
"<class_@GDScript_method_parse_json>`, so we will use a dictionary. Our node "
"needs to contain a save function that returns this data. The save function "
"will look like this:"

"This gives us a dictionary with the style ``{ \"variable_name\":"
"value_of_variable }``, which will be useful when loading."

"As covered in the :ref:`doc_filesystem` tutorial, we'll need to open a file "
"so we can write to it or read from it. Now that we have a way to call our "
"groups and get their relevant data, let's use :ref:`to_json() "
"<class_@GDScript_method_to_json>` to convert it into an easily stored string "
"and store them in a file. Doing it this way ensures that each line is its "
"own object, so we have an easy way to pull the data out of the file as well."

"Game saved! Loading is fairly simple as well. For that, we'll read each "
"line, use parse_json() to read it back to a dict, and then iterate over the "
"dict to read our values. But we'll need to first create the object and we "
"can use the filename and parent values to achieve that. Here is our load "
"function:"

"Now we can save and load an arbitrary number of objects laid out almost "

"We have glossed over setting up the game state for loading. It's ultimately "
"up to the project creator where much of this logic goes. This is often "
"complicated and will need to be heavily customized based on the needs of the "
"individual project."

"Additionally, our implementation assumes no Persist objects are children of "
"other Persist objects. Otherwise, invalid paths would be created. To "
"accommodate nested Persist objects, consider saving objects in stages. Load "
"parent objects first so they are available for the :ref:`add_child() "
"<class_node_method_add_child>` call when child objects are loaded. You will "
"also need a way to link children to parents as the :ref:`NodePath "
"<class_nodepath>` will likely be invalid."
