"The demo consists of a single scene. This scene includes two major parts: "
"the GUI and the audio."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We will focus on the audio part. In this demo, a bus named ``Record`` with "
"the effect ``Record`` is created to handle the audio recording. An "
"``AudioStreamPlayer`` named ``AudioStreamRecord`` is used for recording."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The audio recording is handled by the :ref:`class_AudioEffectRecord` "
"resource which has three methods: :ref:`get_recording() "
"<class_AudioEffectRecord_method_get_recording>`, :ref:`is_recording_active() "
"<class_AudioEffectRecord_method_is_recording_active>`, and :ref:"
"`set_recording_active() "
"<class_AudioEffectRecord_method_set_recording_active>`."

msgid ""
"At the start of the demo, the recording effect is not active. When the user "
"presses the ``RecordButton``, the effect is enabled with "
"``set_recording_active(true)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the next button press, as ``effect.is_recording_active()`` is ``true``, "
"the recorded stream can be stored into the ``recording`` variable by calling "
"``effect.get_recording()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To playback the recording, you assign the recording as the stream of the "
"``AudioStreamPlayer`` and call ``play()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To save the recording, you call ``save_to_wav()`` with the path to a file. "
