msgid "Your second 3D shader"

msgid ""
"From a high-level, what Godot does is give the user a bunch of parameters "
"that can be optionally set (``AO``, ``SSS_Strength``, ``RIM``, etc.). These "
"parameters correspond to different complex effects (Ambient Occlusion, "
"SubSurface Scattering, Rim Lighting, etc.). When not written to, the code is "
"thrown out before it is compiled and so the shader does not incur the cost "
"of the extra feature. This makes it easy for users to have complex PBR-"
"correct shading, without writing complex shaders. Of course, Godot also "
"allows you to ignore all these parameters and write a fully customized "
"shader."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a full list of these parameters see the :ref:`spatial shader "
"<doc_spatial_shader>` reference doc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A difference between the vertex function and a fragment function is that the "
"vertex function runs per vertex and sets properties such as ``VERTEX`` "
"(position) and ``NORMAL``, while the fragment shader runs per pixel and, "
"most importantly, sets the ``ALBEDO`` color of the :ref:"
"`MeshInstance3D<class_MeshInstance3D>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your first spatial fragment function"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the previous part of this tutorial. The standard use of the "
"fragment function in Godot is to set up different material properties and "
"let Godot handle the rest. In order to provide even more flexibility, Godot "
"also provides things called render modes. Render modes are set at the top of "
"the shader, directly below ``shader_type``, and they specify what sort of "
"functionality you want the built-in aspects of the shader to have."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, if you do not want to have lights affect an object, set the "
"render mode to ``unshaded``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also stack multiple render modes together. For example, if you want "
"to use toon shading instead of more-realistic PBR shading, set the diffuse "
"mode and specular mode to toon:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This model of built-in functionality allows you to write complex custom "
"shaders by changing only a few parameters."

msgid ""
"In this part of the tutorial, we will walk through how to take the bumpy "
"terrain from the previous part and turn it into an ocean."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First let's set the color of the water. We do that by setting ``ALBEDO``."
msgstr ""

msgid "``ALBEDO`` is a ``vec3`` that contains the color of the object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's set it to a nice shade of blue."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We set it to a very dark shade of blue because most of the blueness of the "
"water will come from reflections from the sky."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The PBR model that Godot uses relies on two main parameters: ``METALLIC`` "
"and ``ROUGHNESS``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``ROUGHNESS`` specifies how smooth/rough the surface of a material is. A low "
"``ROUGHNESS`` will make a material appear like a shiny plastic, while a high "
"roughness makes the material appear more solid in color."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``METALLIC`` specifies how much like a metal the object is. It is better set "
"close to ``0`` or ``1``. Think of ``METALLIC`` as changing the balance "
"between the reflection and the ``ALBEDO`` color. A high ``METALLIC`` almost "
"ignores ``ALBEDO`` altogether, and looks like a mirror of the sky. While a "
"low ``METALLIC`` has a more equal representation of sky color and ``ALBEDO`` "
"color."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``ROUGHNESS`` increases from ``0`` to ``1`` from left to right while "
"``METALLIC`` increase from ``0`` to ``1`` from top to bottom."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``METALLIC`` should be close to ``0`` or ``1`` for proper PBR shading. Only "
"set it between them for blending between materials."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Water is not a metal, so we will set its ``METALLIC`` property to ``0.0``. "
"Water is also highly reflective, so we will set its ``ROUGHNESS`` property "
"to be quite low as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now we have a smooth plastic looking surface. It is time to think about some "
"particular properties of water that we want to emulate. There are two main "
"ones that will take this from a weird plastic surface to nice stylized "
"water. The first is specular reflections. Specular reflections are those "
"bright spots you see from where the sun reflects directly into your eye. The "
"second is fresnel reflectance. Fresnel reflectance is the property of "
"objects to become more reflective at shallow angles. It is the reason why "
"you can see into water below you, but farther away it reflects the sky."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to increase the specular reflections, we will do two things. First, "
"we will change the render mode for specular to toon because the toon render "
"mode has larger specular highlights."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Second we will add rim lighting. Rim lighting increases the effect of light "
"at glancing angles. Usually it is used to emulate the way light passes "
"through fabric on the edges of an object, but we will use it here to help "
"achieve a nice watery effect."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to add fresnel reflectance, we will compute a fresnel term in our "
"fragment shader. Here, we aren't going to use a real fresnel term for "
"performance reasons. Instead, we'll approximate it using the dot product of "
"the ``NORMAL`` and ``VIEW`` vectors. The ``NORMAL`` vector points away from "
"the mesh's surface, while the ``VIEW`` vector is the direction between your "
"eye and that point on the surface. The dot product between them is a handy "
"way to tell when you are looking at the surface head-on or at a glancing "
"angle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And mix it into both ``ROUGHNESS`` and ``ALBEDO``. This is the benefit of "
"ShaderMaterials over StandardMaterial3Ds. With StandardMaterial3D, we could "
"set these properties with a texture, or to a flat number. But with shaders "
"we can set them based on any mathematical function that we can dream up."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And now, with only 5 lines of code, you can have complex looking water. Now "
"that we have lighting, this water is looking too bright. Let's darken it. "
"This is done easily by decreasing the values of the ``vec3`` we pass into "
"``ALBEDO``. Let's set them to ``vec3(0.01, 0.03, 0.05)``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Animating with ``TIME``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Going back to the vertex function, we can animate the waves using the built-"
"in variable ``TIME``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``TIME`` is a built-in variable that is accessible from the vertex and "
"fragment functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the last tutorial we calculated height by reading from a heightmap. For "
"this tutorial, we will do the same. Put the heightmap code in a function "
"called ``height()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to use ``TIME`` in the ``height()`` function, we need to pass it in."
msgstr ""

msgid "And make sure to correctly pass it in inside the vertex function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of using a normalmap to calculate normals. We are going to compute "
"them manually in the ``vertex()`` function. To do so use the following line "
"of code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We need to compute ``NORMAL`` manually because in the next section we will "
"be using math to create complex-looking waves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now, we are going to make the ``height()`` function a little more "
"complicated by offsetting ``position`` by the cosine of ``TIME``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This results in waves that move slowly, but not in a very natural way. The "
"next section will dig deeper into using shaders to create more complex "
"effects, in this case realistic waves, by adding a few more mathematical "
"functions."

msgid "Advanced effects: waves"
msgstr "고급 벡터 연산"

msgid ""
"What makes shaders so powerful is that you can achieve complex effects by "
"using math. To illustrate this, we are going to take our waves to the next "
"level by modifying the ``height()`` function and by introducing a new "
"function called ``wave()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``wave()`` has one parameter, ``position``, which is the same as it is in "
"``height()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We are going to call ``wave()`` multiple times in ``height()`` in order to "
"fake the way waves look."
msgstr ""

msgid "At first this looks complicated. So let's go through it line-by-line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Offset the position by the ``noise`` texture. This will make the waves "
"curve, so they won't be straight lines completely aligned with the grid."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Define a wave-like function using ``sin()`` and ``position``. Normally "
"``sin()`` waves are very round. We use ``abs()`` to absolute to give them a "
"sharp ridge and constrain them to the 0-1 range. And then we subtract it "
"from ``1.0`` to put the peak on top."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiply the x-directional wave by the y-directional wave and raise it to a "
"power to sharpen the peaks. Then subtract that from ``1.0`` so that the "
"ridges become peaks and raise that to a power to sharpen the ridges."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can now replace the contents of our ``height()`` function with ``wave()``."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Using this, you get:"
msgstr "이 가이드는 다음을 배웁니다:"

msgid ""
"The shape of the sin wave is too obvious. So let's spread the waves out a "
"bit. We do this by scaling ``position``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now it looks much better."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can do even better if we layer multiple waves on top of each other at "
"varying frequencies and amplitudes. What this means is that we are going to "
"scale position for each one to make the waves thinner or wider (frequency). "
"And we are going to multiply the output of the wave to make them shorter or "
"taller (amplitude)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is an example for how you could layer the four waves to achieve nicer "
"looking waves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we add time to two and subtract it from the other two. This makes "
"the waves move in different directions creating a complex effect. Also note "
"that the amplitudes (the number the result is multiplied by) all add up to "
"``1.0``. This keeps the wave in the 0-1 range."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With this code you should end up with more complex looking waves and all you "
"had to do was add a bit of math!"
