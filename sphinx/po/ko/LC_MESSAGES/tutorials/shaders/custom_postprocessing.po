msgid "Custom post-processing"
msgstr ""

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "소개"

msgid ""
"Godot provides many post-processing effects out of the box, including Bloom, "
"DOF, and SSAO. Sometimes you want to write your own custom effect. Here's "
"how you can do so."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Post-processing effects are shaders applied to a frame after Godot rendered "
"it. You first want to render your scene into a :ref:`Viewport "
"<class_Viewport>`, then render the ``Viewport`` inside a :ref:"
"`ViewportTexture <class_ViewportTexture>` and show it on the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The easiest way to implement a custom post-processing shader is to use "
"Godot's built-in ability to read from the screen texture. If you're not "
"familiar with this, you should read the :ref:`Screen Reading Shaders "
"Tutorial <doc_screen-reading_shaders>` first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As of the time of writing, Godot does not support rendering to multiple "
"buffers at the same time. Your post-processing shader will not have access "
"to normals or other render passes. You only have access to the rendered "
"frame."
msgstr ""

msgid "Single pass post-processing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You will need a ``Viewport`` to render your scene to, and a scene to render "
"your ``Viewport`` on the screen. You can use a :ref:`ViewportContainer "
"<class_ViewportContainer>` to display your ``Viewport`` on the entire screen "
"or inside another :ref:`Control <class_Control>` node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rendering using a ``Viewport`` gives you control over how the scene render, "
"including the framerate, and you can use the ``ViewportContainer`` to render "
"3D objects in a 2D scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For this demo, we will use a :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` with a "
"``ViewportContainer`` and finally a ``Viewport``. Your **Scene** tab should "
"look like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Inside the ``Viewport``, you can have whatever you want. This will contain "
"your main scene. For this tutorial, we will use a field of random boxes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a new :ref:`ShaderMaterial <class_ShaderMaterial>` to the "
"``ViewportContainer``, and assign a new shader resource to it. You can "
"access your rendered ``Viewport`` with the built-in ``TEXTURE`` uniform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can choose not to use a ``ViewportContainer``, but if you do so, you "
"will need to create your own uniform in the shader and pass the ``Viewport`` "
"texture in manually, like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "And you can pass the texture into the shader from GDScript like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Copy the following code to your shader. The above code is a single pass edge "
"detection filter, a `Sobel filter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Sobel_operator>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Sobel filter reads pixels in a 9x9 grid around the current pixel and "
"adds them together, using weight. What makes it interesting is that it "
"assigns weights to each pixel; +1 for each of the eight around the center "
"and -8 for the center pixel. The choice of weights is called a \"kernel\". "
"You can use different kernels to create edge detection filters, outlines, "
"and all sorts of effects."
msgstr ""

msgid "Multi-pass post-processing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some post-processing effects like blur are resource intensive. If you break "
"them down in multiple passes however, you can make them run a lot faster. In "
"a multipass material, each pass takes the result from the previous pass as "
"an input and processes it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make a multi-pass post-processing shader, you stack ``Viewport`` nodes. "
"In the example above, you rendered the content of one ``Viewport`` object "
"into the root ``Viewport``, through a ``ViewportContainer`` node. You can do "
"the same thing for a multi-pass shader by rendering the content of one "
"``Viewport`` into another and then rendering the last ``Viewport`` into the "
"root ``Viewport``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your scene hierarchy will look something like this:"
msgstr "씬 계층 구조는 다음과 같이 보일 것입니다:"

msgid ""
"Godot will render the bottom ``Viewport`` node first. So if the order of the "
"passes matters for your shaders, make sure that you assign the shader you "
"want to apply first to the lowest ``ViewportContainer`` in the tree."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also render your Viewports separately without nesting them like "
"this. You just need to use two Viewports and to render them one after the "
"other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Apart from the node structure, the steps are the same as with the single-"
"pass post-processing shader."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As an example, you could write a full screen Gaussian blur effect by "
"attaching the following pieces of code to each of the :ref:"
"`ViewportContainers <class_ViewportContainer>`. The order in which you apply "
"the shaders does not matter:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using the above code, you should end up with a full screen blur effect like "
"below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more information on how ``Viewport`` nodes work, see the :ref:`Viewports "
"Tutorial <doc_viewports>`."
