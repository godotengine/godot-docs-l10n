"You might want to change the appearance of the mouse cursor in your game in "
"order to suit the overall design. There are two ways to customize the mouse "
"cursor:"

"Using project settings is a simpler (but more limited) way to customize the "
"mouse cursor. The second way is more customizable, but involves scripting."

"You could display a \"software\" mouse cursor by hiding the mouse cursor and "
"moving a Sprite to the cursor position in a ``_process`` method, but this "
"will add at least one frame of latency compared to an \"hardware\" mouse "
"cursor. Therefore, it's recommended to use the approach described here "
"whenever possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have to use the \"software\" approach, consider adding an "
"extrapolation step to better display the actual mouse input."

"Open project settings, go to Display>Mouse Cursor. You will see Custom Image "
"and Custom Image Hotspot."

msgid ""
"Custom Image is the desired image that you would like to set as the mouse "
"cursor. Custom Hotspot is the point in the image that you would like to use "
"as the cursor's detection point."
