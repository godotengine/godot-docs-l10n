"Godot offers a number of collision objects to provide both collision "
"detection and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your project "
"can be confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if you "
"understand how each of them works and what their pros and cons are. In this "
"tutorial, we'll look at the :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` node and show some "
"examples of how it can be used."

"Godot은 콜리전 감지와 반응성을 모두 제공하기 위해 많은 콜리전 오브젝트를 제공"

"의 작동 방식 및 장단점이 무엇인지 이해한다면 문제를 피하고 개발을 간소화할 "
"수 있습니다. 이 튜토리얼에서는 :ref:`KinematicBody2D "
"<class_KinematicBody2D>` 노드를 살펴보고 사용 방법에 대한 몇 가지 예를 보여 "
"드리겠습니다."

msgid "What is an area?"
msgstr "리지드 바디(rigid body)란?"

msgid ""
"An Area2D defines a region of 2D space. In this space you can detect other :"
"ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` nodes overlapping, "
"entering, and exiting. Areas also allow for overriding local physics "
"properties. We'll explore each of these functions below."

msgid "Area properties"
msgstr "노드 속성"

msgid "Areas have many properties you can use to customize their behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Gravity``, ``Linear Damp``, and ``Angular Damp`` sections are used to "
"configure the area's physics override behavior. We'll look at how to use "
"those in the *Area influence* section below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Monitoring`` and ``Monitorable`` are used to enable and disable the area."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Audio Bus`` section allows you to override audio in the area, for "
"example to apply an audio effect when the player moves through."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that Area2D extends :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, "
"so it also provides properties inherited from that class. The ``Collision`` "
"section of ``CollisionObject2D`` is where you configure the area's collision "
"layer(s) and mask(s)."

msgid "Overlap detection"
msgstr "오버라이딩(Overriding) 가능한 함수들"

msgid ""
"Perhaps the most common use of Area2D nodes is for contact and overlap "
"detection. When you need to know that two objects have touched, but don't "
"need physical collision, you can use an area to notify you of the contact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, let's say we're making a coin for the player to pick up. The "
"coin is not a solid object - the player can't stand on it or push it - we "
"just want it to disappear when the player touches it."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Here's the node setup for the coin:"
msgstr "플레이어 바디를 위한 코드입니다:"

msgid ""
"To detect the overlap, we'll connect the appropriate signal on the Area2D. "
"Which signal to use depends on the player's node type. If the player is "
"another area, use ``area_entered``. However, let's assume our player is a "
"``CharacterBody2D`` (and therefore a ``CollisionObject2D`` type), so we'll "
"connect the ``body_entered`` signal."

"If you're not familiar with using signals, see :ref:`doc_signals` for an "
"introduction."

msgid "Some other usage examples:"
msgstr "몇 가지 예제:"

msgid ""
"Areas are great for bullets and other projectiles that hit and deal damage, "
"but don't need any other physics such as bouncing."

msgid ""
"Use a large circular area around an enemy to define its \"detect\" radius. "
"When the player is outside the area, the enemy can't \"see\" it."

"\"Security cameras\" - In a large level with multiple cameras, attach areas "
"to each camera and activate them when the player enters."

msgid "Area influence"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second major use for area nodes is to alter physics. By default, the "
"area won't do this, but you can enable this with the ``Space Override`` "
"property. When areas overlap, they are processed in ``Priority`` order "
"(higher priority areas are processed first). There are four options for "
"override:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Combine* - The area adds its values to what has been calculated so far."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Replace* - The area replaces physics properties, and lower priority areas "
"are ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Combine-Replace* - The area adds its gravity/damping values to whatever has "
"been calculated so far (in priority order), ignoring any lower priority "
"areas."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Replace-Combine* - The area replaces any gravity/damping calculated so far, "
"but keeps calculating the rest of the areas."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using these properties, you can create very complex behavior with multiple "
"overlapping areas."
msgstr ""

msgid "The physics properties that can be overridden are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Gravity* - Gravity's strength inside the area."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Gravity Direction* - This vector does not need to be normalized."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Linear Damp* - How quickly objects stop moving - linear velocity lost per "
"second."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Angular Damp* - How quickly objects stop spinning - angular velocity lost "
"per second."
msgstr ""

msgid "Point gravity"
msgstr "중력"

msgid ""
"The ``Gravity Point`` property allows you to create an \"attractor\". "
"Gravity in the area will be calculated towards a point, given by the ``Point "
"Center`` property. Values are relative to the Area2D, so for example using "
"``(0, 0)`` will attract objects to the center of the area."
