"Godot offers a number of collision objects to provide both collision "
"detection and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your project "
"can be confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if you "
"understand how each of them works and what their pros and cons are. In this "
"tutorial, we'll look at the :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` node and show some "
"examples of how it can be used."

"Godot은 콜리전 감지와 반응성을 모두 제공하기 위해 많은 콜리전 오브젝트를 제공"

"수 있습니다. 이 튜토리얼에서는 :ref:`KinematicBody2D "
"<class_KinematicBody2D>` 노드를 살펴보고 사용 방법에 대한 몇 가지 예를 보여 "

msgid "What is an area?"
msgstr "리지드 바디(rigid body)란?"

msgid ""
"An Area2D defines a region of 2D space. In this space you can detect other :"
"ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` nodes overlapping, "
"entering, and exiting. Areas also allow for overriding local physics "
"properties. We'll explore each of these functions below."

msgid "Area properties"
msgstr "노드 속성"

msgid "Areas have many properties you can use to customize their behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first eight properties are used to configure the area's physics override "
"behavior. We'll look at how to use those in the section below."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Monitoring* and *Monitorable* are used to enable and disable the area."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"Collision\" section is where you configure the area's collision "
"layer(s) and mask(s)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"Audio Bus\" section allows you to override audio in the area, for "
"example to apply an audio effect when the player moves through."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that Area2D extends :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, "
"so it also provides properties inherited from that class, such as "
"``input_pickable``."

msgid "Overlap detection"
msgstr "오버라이딩(Overriding) 가능한 함수들"

msgid ""
"Perhaps the most common use of Area2D nodes is for contact and overlap "
"detection. When you need to know that two objects have touched, but don't "
"need physical collision, you can use an area to notify you of the contact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, let's say we're making a coin for the player to pick up. The "
"coin is not a solid object - the player can't stand on it or push it - we "
"just want it to disappear when the player touches it."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Here's the node setup for the coin:"
msgstr "플레이어 바디를 위한 코드입니다:"

msgid ""
"To detect the overlap, we'll connect the appropriate signal on the Area2d. "
"Which signal to use depends on the player's node type. If the player is "
"another area, use ``area_entered``. However, let's assume our player is a "
"``KinematicBody2D`` (and therefore a ``CollisionObject2D`` type), so we'll "
"connect the ``body_entered`` signal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're not familiar with using signals, see :ref:`doc_signals` for an "
"introduction."

msgid "Some other usage examples:"
msgstr "몇 가지 예제:"

msgid ""
"Areas are great for bullets and other projectiles that hit and deal damage, "
"but don't need any other physics such as bouncing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use a large circular area around an enemy to define its \"detect\" radius. "
"When the player is outside the area, the enemy can't \"see\" it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"Security cameras\" - In a large level with multiple cameras, attach areas "
"to each camera and activate them when the player enters."

"See the :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game` for an example of using Area2D in a "

msgid "Area influence"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second major use for area nodes is to alter physics. By default, the "
"area won't do this, but you can enable this with the *Space Override* "
"property. When areas overlap, they are processed in *Priority* order (higher "
"priority areas are processed first). There are four options for override:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Combine* - The area adds its values to what has been calculated so far."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Replace* - The area replaces physics properties, and lower priority areas "
"are ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Combine-Replace* - The area adds its gravity/damping values to whatever has "
"been calculated so far (in priority order), ignoring any lower priority "
"areas."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Replace-Combine* - The area replaces any gravity/damping calculated so far, "
"but keeps calculating the rest of the areas."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using these properties, you can create very complex behavior with multiple "
"overlapping areas."
msgstr ""

msgid "The physics properties that can be overridden are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Gravity* - Gravity's strength inside the area."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Gravity Vec* - Gravity's direction. This vector does not need to be "
"normalized."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Linear Damp* - How quickly objects stop moving - linear velocity lost per "
"second."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Angular Damp* - How quickly objects stop spinning - angular velocity lost "
"per second."
msgstr ""

msgid "Point gravity"
msgstr "중력"

msgid ""
"The *Gravity Point* property allows you to create an \"attractor\". Gravity "
"in the area will be calculated towards a point, given by the *Gravity Vec* "
"property. Values are relative to the Area2D, so for example using ``(0, 0)`` "
"will attract objects to the center of the area."
