"This articles explains how to create and manage UI themes using the Godot "
"editor and its theme editor tool. We recommend getting familiar with the "
"basics behind GUI skinning/theming by reading :ref:`doc_gui_skinning` before "
"starting."

"The theme editor is a bottom panel tool that activates automatically, when "
"a :ref:`Theme <class_Theme>` resource is selected for editing. It contains "
"the necessary UI for adding, removing, and adjusting theme types and theme "
"items. It features a preview section for testing your changes live, as well "
"as a window dialog for doing bulk operations of the theme items."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a theme"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like any other resources, themes can be created directly in the file system "
"dock by right-clicking and selecting **New Resource...**, then selecting "
"**Theme** and clicking **Create**. This is especially useful for creating "
"project-wide themes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Themes also can be created from any control node. Select a control node in "
"the scene hierarchy, then in the inspector go to the ``theme`` property. "
"From there you can select **New Theme**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will create an empty theme and open up the theme editor. Keep in mind "
"that resources created this way are bundled with the scene by default. Use "
"the context menu to save the new theme to a file instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While the theme editor provides the tools to manage theme types and items, "
"themes also include the default, fallback font that you can edit only using "
"the Inspector dock. Same applies to the contents of complex resource types, "
"such as :ref:`StyleBoxes <class_StyleBox>` and icons — they open for editing "
"in the Inspector."

msgid ""
"The theme editor has two main parts. The main theme editor, located at the "
"bottom of the Godot editor, aims to provide users with tools to quickly "
"create, edit, and delete theme items and types. It gives visual tools for "
"picking and changing controls, abstracting the underlying theme concepts. "
"The **Manage Theme Items** dialog, on the other hand, tries to address the "
"needs of those who want to change themes manually. It's also useful for "
"creating a new editor theme."
msgstr ""

msgid "Theme previews"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The left-hand side of the main editor has a set of preview tabs. The "
"**Default Preview** tab is visible out of the box and contains most of the "
"frequently used controls in various states. Previews are interactive, so "
"intermediate states (e.g. hover) can be previewed as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additional tabs can be created from arbitrary scenes in your project. The "
"scene must have a control node as its root to function as a preview. To add "
"a new tab click the **Add Preview** button and select the saved scene from "
"your file system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you make changes to the scene, they will not be reflected in the preview "
"automatically. To update the preview click the reload button on the toolbar."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Previews can also be used to quickly select the theme type to edit. Select "
"the picker tool from the toolbar and hover over the preview area to "
"highlight control nodes. Highlighted control nodes display their class name. "
"Clicking on the highlighted control opens it for editing on the right-hand "
"side."
msgstr ""

msgid "Theme types and items"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The right-hand side of the theme editor provides a list of theme types "
"available in the edited theme resource, and the contents of the selected "
"type. The list of type's items is divided into several tabs, corresponding "
"to each data type available in the theme (colors, constants, styles, etc.). "
"If the **Show Default** option is enabled, then for each built-in type its "
"default theme values are displayed, greyed out. If the option is disabled, "
"only the items available in the edited theme itself are displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Individual items from the default theme can be added to the current theme by "
"clicking on the **Override** button next to the item. You can also override "
"all the default items of the selected theme type by clicking on the "
"**Override All** button. Overridden properties can then be removed with the "
"**Remove Item** button. Properties can also be renamed using the **Rename "
"Item** button, and completely custom properties can be added to the list "
"using the text field below it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Overridden theme items can be edited directly in the right-hand panel, "
"unless they are resources. Resources have rudimentary controls available for "
"them, but must be edited in the Inspector dock instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Styleboxes have an unique feature available, where you can pin an individual "
"stylebox from the list. Pinned stylebox acts like the leader of the pack, "
"and all styleboxes of the same type are updated alongside it when you change "
"its properties. This allows you to edit properties of several styleboxes at "
"the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While theme types can be picked from a preview, they can also be added "
"manually. Clicking the plus button next to the type list opens the **Add "
"item Type** menu. In that menu you can either select a type from the list, "
"or you can enter an arbitrary name to create a custom type. Text field also "
"filters the list of control nodes."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create, rename and remove individual theme items here by clicking "
"the corresponding **Add X Item** and specifying their name. You can also "
"mass delete theme items either by their data type (using the brush icon in "
"the list) or by their quality. **Remove Class Items** will remove all built-"
"in theme items you have customized for a control node type. **Remove Custom "
"Items** will remove all the custom theme items for the selected type. "
"Finally, **Remove All Items** will remove everything from the type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From the **Import Items** tab you can import theme items from other themes. "
"You can import items from the default Godot theme, the Godot editor theme, "
"or another custom theme. You can import individual or multiple items, and "
"you can decide whether to copy or omit their data as well. There are several "
"way you can select and deselect the items, including by hand, by hierarchy, "
"by data type, and everything. Opting to include the data will copy all theme "
"items as they are to your theme. Omitting the data will create the items of "
"the corresponding data type and name, but will leave them empty, creating a "
"template of a theme in a way."
