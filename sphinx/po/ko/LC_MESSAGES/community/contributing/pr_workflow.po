"The so-called \"PR workflow\" used by Godot is common to many projects using "
"Git, and should be familiar to veteran free software contributors. The idea "
"is that only a small number (if any) commit directly to the *master* branch. "
"Instead, contributors *fork* the project (i.e. create a copy of it, which "
"they can modify as they wish), and then use the GitHub interface to request "
"a *pull* from one of their fork's branches to one branch of the original "
"(often named *upstream*) repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/community/contributing/pr_workflow.rst:16
msgid ""
"The resulting *pull request* (PR) can then be reviewed by other "
"contributors, which might approve it, reject it, or most often request that "
"modifications be done. Once approved, the PR can then be merged by one of "
"the core developers, and its commit(s) will become part of the target branch "
"(usually the *master* branch)."
