"This guide explains how to contribute to Godot's documentation, be it by "
"writing or reviewing pages."

"To modify or create pages in the reference manual, you need to edit ``.rst`` "
"files in the `godot-docs GitHub repository <https://github.com/godotengine/"
"godot-docs>`_. Modifying those pages in a pull request triggers a rebuild of "
"the online documentation upon merging."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For details on Git usage and the pull request workflow, please refer to the :"
"ref:`doc_pr_workflow` page. Most of what it describes regarding the main "
"godotengine/godot repository is also valid for the docs repository."

msgid ""
"The class reference's source files are in the `Godot engine repository "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`_. We generate the :ref:`Godot API "
"<toc-class-ref>` section of this documentation from them. If you want to "
"update the description of a class, its methods, or properties, read :ref:"

"recommendations to write in a way that everyone understands."

"Though less convenient to edit than a wiki, this Git repository is where we "
"write the documentation. Having direct access to the source files in a "
