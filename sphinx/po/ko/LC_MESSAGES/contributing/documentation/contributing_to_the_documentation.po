"This guide explains how to contribute to Godot's documentation, be it by "
"writing or reviewing pages."
msgstr ""

"If you want to translate pages or the class reference from English to other "
"languages, read :ref:`doc_editor_and_docs_localization`."

msgid "Getting started"
msgstr "시작하기"

msgid ""
"To modify or create pages in the reference manual, you need to edit ``.rst`` "
"files in the `godot-docs GitHub repository <https://github.com/godotengine/"
"godot-docs>`_. Modifying those pages in a pull request triggers a rebuild of "
"the online documentation upon merging."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For details on Git usage and the pull request workflow, please refer to the :"
"ref:`doc_pr_workflow` page. Most of what it describes regarding the main "
"godotengine/godot repository is also valid for the docs repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The class reference's source files are in the `Godot engine repository "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`_. We generate the :ref:`Class "
"Reference <doc_class_reference>` section of this documentation from them. If "
"you want to update the description of a class, its methods, or properties, "
"read :ref:`doc_updating_the_class_reference`."

msgid "What is the Godot documentation"
msgstr "문서에 대하여"

msgid ""
"The Godot documentation is intended as a comprehensive reference manual for "

"except for two game creation tutorials in the Getting Started section."

msgid ""
"We strive to write factual content in an accessible and well-written "
"language. To contribute, you should also read:"

"recommendations to write in a way that everyone understands."
msgstr ""

"changes only apply to that specific version of Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Though less convenient to edit than a wiki, this Git repository is where we "
"write the documentation. Having direct access to the source files in a "
"revision control system is a plus to ensure our documentation quality."
