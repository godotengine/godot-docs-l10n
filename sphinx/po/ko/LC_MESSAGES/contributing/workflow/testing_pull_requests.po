"Many people are developing new features or fixing bugs on GitHub. To help "
"with engine development, you may be asked to test those pull requests with a "
"Godot build that includes code from the pull request in question."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thanks to GitHub Actions, all `pull requests <https://github.com/godotengine/"
"godot/pulls>`__ have continuous builds available. These builds let you try "
"out pull requests without having to compile anything from source."
msgstr ""

msgid "Downloading a compiled build"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can download pull request builds from GitHub Actions. Since only signed "
"in users may download builds directly from GitHub Actions, the procedure "
"varies depending on whether you have a GitHub account or not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to a GitHub Actions limitation, builds are only available for 90 days "
"after the pull request was last updated. If you still wish to try a pull "
"request locally, you can :ref:`compile the pull request branch from source "
"<doc_testing_pull_requests_compile>` instead."

"Open the pull request page. Click the **Checks** tab near the top of the "
"page:"

msgid "Click the **Artifacts** dropdown on the right of the page:"

msgid ""
"In the dropdown, click the artifact's name to download it. Remember to "
"scroll if you cannot see the name of the platform you're looking for:"
msgstr ""

"Extract the ZIP archive then run the executable. Note that Windows and macOS "
"binaries are **not** code signed. This means you may have to bypass a "
"security warning before you can run the executable. On Windows, if you "
"frequently test pull request builds, it may be better to disable Windows "
"SmartScreen permanently in the Windows security settings. On macOS, see :ref:"
"`doc_running_on_macos` for instructions on bypassing Gatekeeper."

"Open the pull request page. Click the *fork*'s branch name near the top of "
"the page:"

msgid ""
"Now that you are on the fork's branch page, click the ``.github`` folder at "
"the top of the file list. Then, click on the ``workflows`` folder (whicb is "

"wish to download artifacts for. *After* clicking on the file (which opens "

"you just copied into the text field located below the heading **Paste a "
"GitHub link, get a nightly.link!**. After pasting the URL, click **Get "
"links** on the right. If the format of the URL you pasted is correct, you "
