"The procedure for this is somewhat complex and requires a lot of steps, but "
"once you have the environment properly configured you can compile Godot for "
"iOS anytime you want."

msgid ""
"While it is possible to compile for iOS on a Linux environment, Apple is "
"very restrictive about the tools to be used (especially hardware-wise), "
"allowing pretty much only their products to be used for development. So this "
"is **not official**. However, in 2010 Apple said they relaxed some of the "
"`App Store review guidelines <https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/"
"guidelines/>`__ to allow any tool to be used, as long as the resulting "
"binary does not download any code, which means it should be OK to use the "
"procedure described here and cross-compiling the binary."

"Once you've done the above steps, you should keep two things in your "
