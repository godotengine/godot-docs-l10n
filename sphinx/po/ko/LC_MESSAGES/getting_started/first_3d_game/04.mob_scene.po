"Let's design the monsters themselves in a new scene. The node structure is "
"going to be similar to the *Player* scene."

msgid ""
"Create a scene with, once again, a *KinematicBody* node as its root. Name it "
"*Mob*. Add a *Spatial* node as a child of it, name it *Pivot*. And drag and "
"drop the file ``mob.glb`` from the *FileSystem* dock onto the *Pivot* to add "
"the monster's 3D model to the scene. You can rename the newly created *mob* "
"node into *Character*."

"The box should touch the floor and be a little thinner than the model. "
"Physics engines work in such a way that if the player's sphere touches even "
"the box's corner, a collision will occur. If the box is a little too big "
"compared to the 3D model, you may die at a distance from the monster, and "
"the game will feel unfair to the players."

"Notice that my box is taller than the monster. It is okay in this game "

"Collision shapes don't have to match the model exactly. It's the way the "
"game feels when you test it that should dictate their form and size."

msgstr "오래된 적들 제거하기"

msgid ""
"We're going to spawn monsters at regular time intervals in the game level. "
"If we're not careful, their count could increase to infinity, and we don't "
"want that. Each mob instance has both a memory and a processing cost, and we "
"don't want to pay for it when the mob's outside the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once a monster leaves the screen, we don't need it anymore, so we can delete "
"it. Godot has a node that detects when objects leave the screen, "
"*VisibilityNotifier*, and we're going to use it to destroy our mobs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you keep instancing an object in games, there's a technique you can use "
"to avoid the cost of creating and destroying instances all the time called "
"pooling. It consists of pre-creating an array of objects and reusing them "
"over and over."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When working with GDScript, you don't need to worry about this. The main "
"reason to use pools is to avoid freezes with garbage-collected languages "
"like C# or Lua. GDScript uses a different technique to manage memory, "
"reference counting, which doesn't have that caveat. You can learn more about "
"that here :ref:`doc_gdscript_basics_memory_management`."

"Select the *Mob* node and add a *VisibilityNotifier* as a child of it. "

msgid "Coding the mob's movement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's implement the monster's motion. We're going to do this in two steps. "
"First, we'll write a script on the *Mob* that defines a function to "
"initialize the monster. We'll then code the randomized spawn mechanism in "
"the *Main* scene and call the function from there."

msgid ""
"Here's the movement code to start with. We define two properties, "
"``min_speed`` and ``max_speed``, to define a random speed range. We then "
"define and initialize the ``velocity``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly to the player, we move the mob every frame by calling "
"``KinematicBody``\\ 's ``move_and_slide()`` method. This time, we don't "
"update the ``velocity`` every frame: we want the monster to move at a "
"constant speed and leave the screen, even if it were to hit an obstacle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may see a warning in GDScript that the return value from "
"``move_and_slide()`` is unused. This is expected. You can simply ignore the "
"warning or, if you want to hide it entirely, add the comment ``# warning-"
"ignore:return_value_discarded`` just above the ``move_and_slide(velocity)`` "
"line. To read more about the GDScript warning system, see :ref:"
"`doc_gdscript_warning_system`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We need to define another function to calculate the start velocity. This "
"function will turn the monster towards the player and randomize both its "
"angle of motion and its velocity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function will take a ``start_position``, the mob's spawn position, and "
"the ``player_position`` as its arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We position the mob at ``start_position`` and turn it towards the player "
"using the ``look_at_from_position()`` method, and randomize the angle by "
"rotating a random amount around the Y axis. Below, ``rand_range()`` outputs "
"a random value between ``-PI / 4`` radians and ``PI / 4`` radians."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We then calculate a random speed using ``rand_range()`` once again and we "
"use it to calculate the velocity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We start by creating a 3D vector pointing forward, multiply it by our "
"``random_speed``, and finally rotate it using the ``Vector3`` class's "
"``rotated()`` method."
