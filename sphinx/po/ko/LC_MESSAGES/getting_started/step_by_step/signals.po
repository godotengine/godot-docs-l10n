"In this lesson, we will look at signals. They are messages that nodes emit "
"when something specific happens to them, like a button being pressed. Other "
"nodes can connect to that signal and call a function when the event occurs."
msgstr ""
"이번 단원에서는 시그널에 대해 살펴보겠습니다. 시그널은 버튼이 눌리는 것과 같"
"은 특정 상황이 발생했을 때 노드가 보내는 메시지입니다. 기타 노드는 이벤트가 "
"발생하면 해당 시그널에 연결하여 함수를 호출할 수 있습니다."

"Signals are a delegation mechanism built into Godot that allows one game "
"object to react to a change in another without them referencing one another. "
"Using signals limits `coupling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Coupling_(computer_programming)>`_ and keeps your code flexible."
msgstr ""
"시그널은 Godot에 내장된 델리게이트 메커니즘으로, 어느 한 게임 오브젝트가 다"
"른 게임 오브젝트를 직접 참조하지 않고도 해당 오브젝트의 변경사항에 반응할 수 "
"있게 해줍니다. 시그널을 사용하면 `커플링 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Coupling_(컴퓨터_프로그래밍)>`_ 을 제한하고 코드를 유연하게 유지할 수 있습니"

"For example, you might have a life bar on the screen that represents the "
"player's health. When the player takes damage or uses a healing potion, you "
"want the bar to reflect the change. To do so, in Godot, you would use "
"signals."

"예를 들어 화면에 플레이어의 생명력을 나타내는 생명력 바가 있을 수 있습니다. "
"플레이어가 피해를 입거나 회복 물약을 사용하면 생명력 바에 변화가 반영되도록 "

"Here, we want to connect the Button's \"pressed\" signal to our Sprite2D, "

msgstr ""

msgid "Double-click the \"pressed\" signal to open the node connection window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There, you can connect the signal to the Sprite2D node. The node needs a "
"receiver method, a function that Godot will call when the Button emits the "
"signal. The editor generates one for you. By convention, we name these "
"callback methods \"_on_node_name_signal_name\". Here, it'll be "
"\"_on_button_pressed\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When connecting signals via the editor's Node dock, you can use two modes. "
"The simple one only allows you to connect to nodes that have a script "
"attached to them and creates a new callback function on them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The advanced view lets you connect to any node and any built-in function, "

"connection. This feature is only available when connecting nodes in the "

msgid ""
"Let's replace the line with the ``pass`` keyword with code that'll toggle "
"the node's motion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our Sprite2D moves thanks to code in the ``_process()`` function. Godot "
"provides a method to toggle processing on and off: :ref:`Node.set_process() "
"<class_Node_method_set_process>`. Another method of the Node class, "
"``is_processing()``, returns ``true`` if idle processing is active. We can "
"use the ``not`` keyword to invert the value."

msgid ""
"This function will toggle processing and, in turn, the icon's motion on and "
"off upon pressing the button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before trying the game, we need to simplify our ``_process()`` function to "

"You can connect signals via code instead of using the editor. This is "

msgid "Call the ``connect()`` method on the Timer's \"timeout\" signal."

msgid ""
"To connect to a signal via code, you need to call the ``connect()`` method "

"Timer's \"timeout\" signal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We want to connect the signal when the scene is instantiated, and we can do "
"that using the :ref:`Node._ready() <class_Node_private_method__ready>` built-"
"in function, which is called automatically by the engine when a node is "
"fully instantiated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get a reference to a node relative to the current one, we use the method :"
"ref:`Node.get_node() <class_Node_method_get_node>`. We can store the "
"reference in a variable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function ``get_node()`` looks at the Sprite2D's children and gets nodes "
"by their name. For example, if you renamed the Timer node to "
"\"BlinkingTimer\" in the editor, you would have to change the call to "
"``get_node(\"BlinkingTimer\")``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can now connect the Timer to the Sprite2D in the ``_ready()`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The line reads like so: we connect the Timer's \"timeout\" signal to the "
"node to which the script is attached. When the Timer emits ``timeout``, we "
"want to call the function ``_on_timer_timeout()``, that we need to define. "
"Let's add it at the bottom of our script and use it to toggle our sprite's "
"visibility."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By convention, we name these callback methods in GDScript as "
"\"_on_node_name_signal_name\" and in C# as \"OnNodeNameSignalName\". Here, "
"it'll be \"_on_timer_timeout\" for GDScript and OnTimerTimeout() for C#."
msgstr ""

"The ``visible`` property is a boolean that controls the visibility of our "

"You can define custom signals in a script. Say, for example, that you want "

"you could define a signal named \"died\" or \"health_depleted\" when their "
"health reaches 0."

"correct values."
msgstr ""
"시그널 인수는 편집기의 노드(Node) 독에 표시되며 Godot는 이 인수로 콜백 함수"

msgid ""
"Any node in Godot emits signals when something specific happens to them, "
"like a button being pressed. Other nodes can connect to individual signals "
"and react to selected events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Signals have many uses. With them, you can react to a node entering or "
"exiting the game world, to a collision, to a character entering or leaving "
"an area, to an element of the interface changing size, and much more."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"For example, an :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` representing a coin emits a "
"``body_entered`` signal whenever the player's physics body enters its "
"collision shape, allowing you to know when the player collected it."
msgstr ""
"Godot의 내장 노드 타입 대부분은 이벤트를 감지하는 데 쓰는 시그널을 제공합니"
"다. 예를 들어 :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>`\\ 는 플레이어의 몸이 동전의 콜리"
