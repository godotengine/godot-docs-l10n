"In this lesson, we will look at signals. They are messages that nodes emit "
"when something specific happens to them, like a button being pressed. Other "
"nodes can connect to that signal and call a function when the event occurs."
msgstr ""
"이번 단원에서는 시그널에 대해 살펴보겠습니다. 시그널은 버튼이 눌리는 것과 같"
"은 특정 상황이 발생했을 때 노드가 보내는 메시지입니다. 기타 노드는 이벤트가 "
"발생하면 해당 시그널에 연결하여 함수를 호출할 수 있습니다."

"Signals are a delegation mechanism built into Godot that allows one game "
"object to react to a change in another without them referencing one another. "
"Using signals limits `coupling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Coupling_(computer_programming)>`_ and keeps your code flexible."
msgstr ""
"시그널은 Godot에 내장된 델리게이트 메커니즘으로, 어느 한 게임 오브젝트가 다"
"른 게임 오브젝트를 직접 참조하지 않고도 해당 오브젝트의 변경사항에 반응할 수 "
"있게 해줍니다. 시그널을 사용하면 `커플링 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Coupling_(컴퓨터_프로그래밍)>`_ 을 제한하고 코드를 유연하게 유지할 수 있습니"
"다."

"For example, you might have a life bar on the screen that represents the "
"player’s health. When the player takes damage or uses a healing potion, you "
"want the bar to reflect the change. To do so, in Godot, you would use "
"signals."
msgstr ""
"예를 들어 화면에 플레이어의 생명력을 나타내는 생명력 바가 있을 수 있습니다. "
"플레이어가 피해를 입거나 회복 물약을 사용하면 생명력 바에 변화가 반영되도록 "
"할 수 있습니다. 이를 위해 Godot에서는 시그널을 사용합니다."

"To add a button to our game, we will create a new \"main\" scene which will "

msgid ""
"Here, we want to connect the Button's \"pressed\" signal to our Sprite, and "

"previous lesson."

msgid ""
"You can connect signals in the Node dock. Select the Button node and, on the "

msgstr ""

msgid "Double-click the \"pressed\" signal to open the node connection window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There, you can connect the signal to the Sprite node. The node needs a "
"receiver method, a function that Godot will call when the Button emits the "
"signal. The editor generates one for you. By convention, we name these "
"callback methods \"_on_NodeName_signal_name\". Here, it'll be "
"\"_on_Button_pressed\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When connecting signals via the editor's Node dock, you can use two modes. "
"The simple one only allows you to connect to nodes that have a script "
"attached to them and creates a new callback function on them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The advanced view lets you connect to any node and any built-in function, "
"add arguments to the callback, and set options. You can toggle the mode in "
"the window's bottom-right by clicking the Advanced button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the Connect button to complete the signal connection and jump to the "
"Script workspace. You should see the new method with a connection icon in "
"the left margin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you click the icon, a window pops up and displays information about the "
"connection. This feature is only available when connecting nodes in the "
"editor."

msgid ""
"Let's replace the line with the ``pass`` keyword with code that'll toggle "
"the node's motion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our Sprite moves thanks to code in the ``_process()`` function. Godot "
"provides a method to toggle processing on and off: :ref:`Node.set_process() "
"<class_Node_method_set_process>`. Another method of the Node class, "
"``is_processing()``, returns ``true`` if idle processing is active. We can "
"use the ``not`` keyword to invert the value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function will toggle processing and, in turn, the icon's motion on and "
"off upon pressing the button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before trying the game, we need to simplify our ``_process()`` function to "
"move the node automatically and not wait for user input. Replace it with the "

msgid "Connecting a signal via code"

msgid ""
"You can connect signals via code instead of using the editor. This is "
"necessary when you create nodes or instantiate scenes inside of a script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's use a different node here. Godot has a :ref:`Timer <class_Timer>` node "
"that's useful to implement skill cooldown times, weapon reloading, and more."

msgstr "애니메이션을 적용할 속성을 소유한 노드에 대한 참조"

msgid "Call the Timer's ``connect()`` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To connect to a signal via code, you need to call the ``connect()`` method "
"of the node you want to listen to. In this case, we want to listen to the "
"Timer's \"timeout\" signal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We want to connect the signal when the scene is instantiated, and we can do "
"that using the :ref:`Node._ready() <class_Node_method__ready>` built-in "
"function, which is called automatically by the engine when a node is fully "
"instantiated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get a reference to a node relative to the current one, we use the method :"
"ref:`Node.get_node() <class_Node_method_get_node>`. We can store the "
"reference in a variable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function ``get_node()`` looks at the Sprite's children and gets nodes by "
"their name. For example, if you renamed the Timer node to \"BlinkingTimer\" "
"in the editor, you would have to change the call to "
"``get_node(\"BlinkingTimer\")``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can now connect the Timer to the Sprite in the ``_ready()`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The line reads like so: we connect the Timer's \"timeout\" signal to the "
"node to which the script is attached (``self``). When the Timer emits "
"\"timeout\", we want to call the function \"_on_Timer_timeout\", that we "
"need to define. Let's add it at the bottom of our script and use it to "
"toggle our sprite's visibility."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``visible`` property is a boolean that controls the visibility of our "
"node. The line ``visible = not visible`` toggles the value. If ``visible`` "
"is ``true``, it becomes ``false``, and vice-versa."

msgid "Custom signals"
msgstr "커스텀 시그널"

msgid ""
"This section is a reference on how to define and use your own signals, and "
"does not build upon the project created in previous lessons."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can define custom signals in a script. Say, for example, that you want "
"to show a game over screen when the player's health reaches zero. To do so, "
"you could define a signal named \"died\" or \"health_depleted\" when their "
"health reaches 0."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As signals represent events that just occurred, we generally use an action "
"verb in the past tense in their names."

msgid ""
"Your signals work the same way as built-in ones: they appear in the Node tab "

"The signal arguments show up in the editor's node dock, and Godot can use "
"them to generate callback functions for you. However, you can still emit any "
"number of arguments when you emit signals. So it's up to you to emit the "
"correct values."
msgstr ""
"시그널 인수는 편집기의 노드(Node) 독에 표시되며 Godot는 이 인수로 콜백 함수"

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "요약"

msgid ""
"Any node in Godot emits signals when something specific happens to them, "
"like a button being pressed. Other nodes can connect to individual signals "
"and react to selected events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Signals have many uses. With them, you can react to a node entering or "
"exiting the game world, to a collision, to a character entering or leaving "
"an area, to an element of the interface changing size, and much more."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"For example, an :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` representing a coin emits a "
"``body_entered`` signal whenever the player's physics body enters its "
"collision shape, allowing you to know when the player collected it."
msgstr ""
"Godot의 내장 노드 타입 대부분은 이벤트를 감지하는 데 쓰는 시그널을 제공합니"
"다. 예를 들어 :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>`\\ 는 플레이어의 몸이 동전의 콜리"
