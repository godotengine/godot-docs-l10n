msgid "For compiling under Windows, the following is required:"

"`Visual Studio Community <https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/>`_, "

"\"Installing Visual Studio caveats\" below or you will have to run/download "
"the installer again.**"

"`MinGW-w64 <http://mingw-w64.org/>`__ with GCC can be used as an alternative "

"`Python 3.5+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_. **Make sure to "
"enable the option to add Python to the ``PATH`` in the installer.**"

"`SCons <https://www.scons.org/>`_ build system. Using the latest release is "
"recommended, especially for proper support of recent Visual Studio releases."

"If you have `Scoop <https://scoop.sh/>`_ installed, you can easily install "

msgid ""
"If you are prompted with the message ``Defaulting to user installation "
"because normal site-packages is not writeable``, you may have to run that "
"command again using elevated permissions. Open a new command prompt as an "
"Administrator then run the command again to ensure that SCons is available "
"from the ``PATH``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check whether you have installed Python and SCons correctly, you can type "
"``python --version`` and ``scons --version`` into a command prompt (``cmd."
"exe``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the commands above don't work, make sure to add Python to your ``PATH`` "

"running the Python installer again and enabling the option to add Python to "
"the ``PATH``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If SCons cannot detect your Visual Studio installation, it might be that "

msgid ""
"If you've already made the mistake of installing Visual Studio without C++ "
"support, run the installer again; it should present you a **Modify** button. "

msgid "Selecting a compiler"

msgid ""
"SCons will automatically find and use an existing Visual Studio "
"installation. If you do not have Visual Studio installed, it will attempt to "
"use MinGW instead. If you already have Visual Studio installed and want to "
"use MinGW, pass ``use_mingw=yes`` to the SCons command line. Note that MSVC "
"builds cannot be performed from the MSYS2 or MinGW shells. Use either ``cmd."
"exe`` or PowerShell instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During development, using the Visual Studio compiler is usually a better "
"idea, as it links the Godot binary much faster than MinGW. However, MinGW "
"can produce more optimized binaries using link-time optimization (see "
"below), making it a better choice for production use."

"If all goes well, the resulting binary executable will be placed in ``C:"
"\\godot\\bin\\`` with the name ``godot.windows.tools.32.exe`` or ``godot."
"windows.tools.64.exe``. By default, SCons will build a binary matching your "
"CPU architecture, but this can be overridden using ``bits=64`` or "
"``bits=32``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This executable file contains the whole engine and runs without any "
"dependencies. Running it will bring up the Project Manager."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are compiling Godot for production use, then you can make the final "
"executable smaller and faster by adding the SCons option "
"``target=release_debug``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are compiling Godot with MinGW, you can make the binary even smaller "
"and faster by adding the SCons option ``use_lto=yes``. As link-time "
"optimization is a memory-intensive process, this will require about 7 GB of "
"available RAM while compiling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to use separate editor settings for your own Godot builds and "

"Using an IDE is not required to compile Godot, as SCons takes care of "
