"Run the following commands to download and import it. On Windows, you can "
"run it from the Mono command line prompt (or the regular prompt if you added "
"Mono's ``bin`` directory to your ``PATH`` environment variable)::"

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can use the following command, though it's deprecated and "
"may not work correctly::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Environment variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, SCons will try to find Mono in the Windows Registry on Windows "
"or via ``pkg-config`` on other platforms. You can specify a different "
"installation directory by passing the ``mono_prefix`` command-line option to "
"SCons; e.g. ``scons [...] mono_prefix=%ProgramFiles%/Mono``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the directory that contains the subdirectories ``include`` and "
"``lib``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enable the Mono module"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the Mono module is disabled when building. To enable it, add the "
"option ``module_mono_enabled=yes`` to the SCons command line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Generate the glue"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Glue sources are the wrapper functions that will be called by managed "
"methods. These source files must be generated before building your final "
"binaries. In order to generate them, first, you must build a temporary Godot "
"binary with the options ``tools=yes`` and ``mono_glue=no``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the build finishes, you need to run the compiled executable with the "
"parameter ``--generate-mono-glue`` followed by the path to an output "
"directory. This path must be ``modules/mono/glue`` in the Godot directory::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This command will tell Godot to generate the file ``modules/mono/glue/"
"mono_glue.gen.cpp`` and the C# solution for the Godot API at ``modules/mono/"
"glue/Managed/Generated``. Once these files are generated, you can build "
"Godot for all the desired targets without having to repeat this process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``<godot_binary>`` refers to the tools binary you compiled above with the "
"Mono module enabled. Its exact name will differ based on your system and "
"configuration, but should be of the form ``bin/godot.<platform>.tools.<bits>."
"mono``, e.g. ``bin/godot.x11.tools.64.mono`` or ``bin/godot.windows.tools.64."
"mono.exe``. Be especially aware of the **.mono** suffix! If you've "
"previously compiled Godot without Mono support, you might have similarly "
"named binaries without this suffix. These binaries can't be used to generate "
"the Mono glue."
msgstr ""

msgid "Notes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Do not build your final binaries with** ``mono_glue=no``. This disables C# "
"scripting. This option must be used only for the temporary binary that will "
"generate the glue. Godot will print a warning at startup if it was built "
"without the glue sources."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The glue sources must be regenerated every time the ClassDB-registered API "
"changes. That is, for example, when a new method is registered to the "
"scripting API or one of the parameters of such a method changes. Godot will "
"print an error at startup if there is an API mismatch between ClassDB and "
"the glue sources."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rebuild with Mono glue"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you have generated the Mono glue, you can build the final binary with "
"``mono_glue=yes``. This is the default value for ``mono_glue``, so you can "
"also omit it. To build a Mono-enabled editor::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If everything went well, apart from the normal output, SCons should have "
"created the following files in the ``bin`` directory:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're not linking the Mono runtime statically, the build script will "
"place the Mono runtime shared library (``monosgen-2.0``) next to the Godot "
"binary in the output directory. Make sure to include this library when "
"distributing Godot. When targeting Android, no extra steps are required as "
"this library is automatically copied to ``#platform/android/java/libs`` and "
"Gradle takes care of the rest."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike \"classical\" Godot builds, when building with the Mono module "
"enabled (and depending on the target platform), a data directory may be "
"created both for the editor and for export templates. This directory is "
"important for proper functioning and must be distributed together with "
"Godot. More details about this directory in :ref:`Data "

"Compiling the Android export templates with Mono is a bit simpler than it is "
"for the desktop platforms, as there are no additional steps required after "

"automatically added to the Gradle project."
