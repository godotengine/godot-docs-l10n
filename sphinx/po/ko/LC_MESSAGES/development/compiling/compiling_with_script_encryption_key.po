"The export dialog gives you the option to encrypt your scripts with an "
"256bit AES key, when releasing your game. This will make sure your scripts "
"are not stored in plain text and can not easily be ripped by some script "
"kiddie. Of course the key needs to be stored in the binary, but if it's "
"compiled, optimized and without symbols, it would take some effort to find "
"it."

"For this to work, you need to build the export templates from source, with "
"that same key."

"Generate a 256bit AES key in HEX. You can use the aes-256-cbc variant from "

msgid "The output in ``godot.gdkey`` should be similar to:"

"You can generate the key without redirecting the output to a file, but that "

"If you get an error like below, it means the key wasn't properly included in "
"your Godot build. Godot is encrypting the scripts during export, but can't "
"read them at runtime."

"아래와 같이 오류가 발생하면, 여러분의 Godot 빌드에 키가 제대로 포함되지 있지 "

"수 없습니다."
