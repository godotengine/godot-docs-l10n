"Variant is the most important datatype of Godot, it's the most important "
"class in the engine. A Variant takes up only 20 bytes and can store almost "
"any engine datatype inside of it. Variants are rarely used to hold "
"information for long periods of time, instead they are used mainly for "
"communication, editing, serialization and generally moving data around."
