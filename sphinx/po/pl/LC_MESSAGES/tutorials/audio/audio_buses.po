"The decibel (dB) scale is a relative scale. It represents the ratio of sound "

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:28

"For every 6 dB, sound amplitude doubles or halves. 12 dB represents a factor "

"Since the scale is logarithmic, true zero (no audio) can't be represented."

msgid ""
"0 dB is the maximum amplitude possible in a digital audio system. This limit "
"is not the human limit, but a limit from the sound hardware. Audio with "
"amplitudes that are too high to be represented properly below 0 dB create a "
"kind of distortion called *clipping*."
msgstr ""

"To avoid clipping, your sound mix be arranged so that the output of the "

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:37
msgid ""
"Every 6 dB below the 0 dB limit, sound energy is *halved*. It means the "

msgstr ""

"When working with decibels, sound is considered no longer audible between "

"An *audio bus* (also called an *audio channel*) can be considered a place "
"that audio is channeled through on the way to playback through a device's "

"The leftmost bus is the *master bus*. This bus outputs the mix to your "

"buses can be flexibly routed. After modifying the sound, they send it to "
"another bus to the left. The destination bus can be specified for each of "
"the non-master audio buses. Routing always passes audio from buses on the "

"The Chorus effect duplicates the incoming audio, delays the duplicate "

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:124
msgid ""
"A dynamic range compressor automatically attenuates the level of the "
"incoming signal when its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. The level of "
"attenuation applied is proportional to how far the incoming audio exceeds "
"the threshold. The compressor's Ratio parameter controls the degree of "
"attenuation. One of the main uses of a compressor is to reduce the dynamic "
"range of signals with very loud and quiet parts. Reducing the dynamic range "
"of a signal can make it easier to mix."

"It can be *sidechained*. This means it can reduce the sound level of one "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your goal is to prevent a signal from exceeding a given amplitude "
