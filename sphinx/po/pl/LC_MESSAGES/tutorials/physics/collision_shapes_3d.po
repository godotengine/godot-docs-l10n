"You can define the shape of a :ref:`class_PhysicsBody3D` by adding one or "
"more :ref:`CollisionShape3Ds <class_CollisionShape3D>` as child nodes. Note "

"in the Inspector dock."

"You can represent the collision of most smaller objects using one or more "
"primitive shapes. However, for more complex objects, such as a large ship or "
"a whole level, you may need convex or concave shapes instead. More on that "
"below."

msgid ""
"We recommend favoring primitive shapes for dynamic objects such as "
"RigidBodies and CharacterBodies as their behavior is the most reliable. They "
"often provide better performance as well."

msgid "Convex collision shapes"
msgstr "Kształty kolizji"

msgid ""
":ref:`Convex collision shapes <class_ConvexPolygonShape3D>` are a compromise "
"between primitive collision shapes and concave collision shapes. They can "
"represent shapes of any complexity, but with an important caveat. As their "
"name implies, an individual shape can only represent a *convex* shape. For "
"instance, a pyramid is *convex*, but a hollow box is *concave*. To define a "
"concave object with a single collision shape, you need to use a concave "
"collision shape."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Depending on the object's complexity, you may get better performance by "
"using multiple convex shapes instead of a concave collision shape. Godot "
"lets you use *convex decomposition* to generate convex shapes that roughly "
"match a hollow object. Note this performance advantage no longer applies "
"after a certain amount of convex shapes. For large and complex objects such "
"as a whole level, we recommend using concave shapes instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can generate one or several convex collision shapes from the editor by "
"selecting a MeshInstance3D and using the **Mesh** menu at the top of the 3D "
"viewport. The editor exposes two generation modes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Create Single Convex Collision Sibling** uses the Quickhull algorithm. It "
"creates one CollisionShape node with an automatically generated convex "
"collision shape. Since it only generates a single shape, it provides good "
"performance and is ideal for small objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings** uses the V-HACD algorithm. It "
"creates several CollisionShape nodes, each with a convex shape. Since it "
"generates multiple shapes, it is more accurate for concave objects at the "
"cost of performance. For objects with medium complexity, it will likely be "
"faster than using a single concave collision shape."

msgid "Concave or trimesh collision shapes"
msgstr "Kształty kolizji"

msgid ""
":ref:`Concave collision shapes <class_ConcavePolygonShape3D>`, also called "
"trimesh collision shapes, can take any form, from a few triangles to "
"thousands of triangles. Concave shapes are the slowest option but are also "
"the most accurate in Godot. **You can only use concave shapes within "
"StaticBodies.** They will not work with CharacterBodies or RigidBodies "
"unless the RigidBody's mode is Static."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Even though concave shapes offer the most accurate *collision*, contact "
"reporting can be less precise than primitive shapes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When not using GridMaps for level design, concave shapes are the best "
"approach for a level's collision. That said, if your level has small "
"details, you may want to exclude those from collision for performance and "
"game feel. To do so, you can build a simplified collision mesh in a 3D "
"modeler and have Godot generate a collision shape for it automatically. More "
"on that below"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that unlike primitive and convex shapes, a concave collision shape "
"doesn't have an actual \"volume\". You can place objects both *outside* of "
"the shape as well as *inside*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can generate a concave collision shape from the editor by selecting a "
"MeshInstance3D and using the **Mesh** menu at the top of the 3D viewport. "
"The editor exposes two options:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Create Trimesh Static Body** is a convenient option. It creates a "
"StaticBody containing a concave shape matching the mesh's geometry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Create Trimesh Collision Sibling** creates a CollisionShape node with a "
"concave shape matching the mesh's geometry."

msgid "Performance caveats"
msgstr "Wydajność"

msgid ""
"You aren't limited to a single collision shape per PhysicsBody. Still, we "
"recommend keeping the number of shapes as low as possible to improve "
"performance, especially for dynamic objects like RigidBodies and "
"CharacterBodies. On top of that, avoid translating, rotating, or scaling "
"CollisionShapes to benefit from the physics engine's internal optimizations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using a single non-transformed collision shape in a StaticBody, the "
"engine's *broad phase* algorithm can discard inactive PhysicsBodies. The "
"*narrow phase* will then only have to take into account the active bodies' "
"shapes. If a StaticBody has many collision shapes, the broad phase will "
"fail. The narrow phase, which is slower, must then perform a collision check "
"against each shape."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you run into performance issues, you may have to make tradeoffs in terms "
"of accuracy. Most games out there don't have a 100% accurate collision. They "
"find creative ways to hide it or otherwise make it unnoticeable during "
"normal gameplay."
