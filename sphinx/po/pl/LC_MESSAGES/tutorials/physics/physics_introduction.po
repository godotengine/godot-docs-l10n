"In game development, you often need to know when two objects in the game "
"intersect or come into contact. This is known as **collision detection**. "
"When a collision is detected, you typically want something to happen. This "
"is known as **collision response**."

msgid ""
"Godot offers a number of collision objects in 2D and 3D to provide both "
"collision detection and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your "
"project can be confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if "
"you understand how each works and what their pros and cons are."

"A physics body can hold any number of :ref:`Shape2D <class_Shape2D>` objects "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to detect collisions, at least one ``Shape2D`` must be assigned to "

"The most common way to assign a shape is by adding a :ref:`CollisionShape2D "

"Be careful to never scale your collision shapes in the editor. The \"Scale\" "

msgid "Physics process callback"

msgid ""
"The physics engine may spawn multiple threads to improve performance, so it "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to avoid this inaccuracy, any code that needs to access a body's "
"properties should be run in the :ref:`Node._physics_process() "
"<class_Node_method__physics_process>` callback, which is called before each "
"physics step at a constant frame rate (60 times per second by default). This "
"method will be passed a ``delta`` parameter, which is a floating-point "
"number equal to the time passed in *seconds* since the last step. When using "
"the default 60 Hz physics update rate, it will typically be equal to "
"``0.01666...`` (but not always, see below)."

"One of the most powerful, but frequently misunderstood, collision features "

"You have four node types in your game: Walls, Player, Enemy, and Coin. Both "

"When a rigid body is at rest and hasn't moved for a while, it goes to sleep. "

"by a collision or via code."

msgid "Rigid body modes"

msgid "A rigid body can be set to one of four modes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Rigid** - The body behaves as a physical object. It collides with other "
"bodies and responds to forces applied to it. This is the default mode."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Kinematic** - The body behaves like a :ref:`KinematicBody2D "
"<class_KinematicBody2D>` and must be moved by code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using RigidBody2D"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of the benefits of using a rigid body is that a lot of behavior can be "
"had \"for free\" without writing any code. For example, if you were making "
"an \"Angry Birds\"-style game with falling blocks, you would only need to "
"create RigidBody2Ds and adjust their properties. Stacking, falling, and "
"bouncing would automatically be calculated by the physics engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, if you do wish to have some control over the body, you should take "
"care - altering the ``position``, ``linear_velocity``, or other physics "
"properties of a rigid body can result in unexpected behavior. If you need to "
"alter any of the physics-related properties, you should use the :ref:"
"`_integrate_forces() <class_RigidBody2D_method__integrate_forces>` callback "
"instead of ``_physics_process()``. In this callback, you have access to the "
"body's :ref:`Physics2DDirectBodyState <class_Physics2DDirectBodyState>`, "
"which allows for safely changing properties and synchronizing them with the "
"physics engine."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, here is the code for an \"Asteroids\" style spaceship:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we are not setting the ``linear_velocity`` or ``angular_velocity`` "
"properties directly, but rather applying forces (``thrust`` and ``torque``) "
"to the body and letting the physics engine calculate the resulting movement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a rigid body goes to sleep, the ``_integrate_forces()`` function will "
"not be called. To override this behavior, you will need to keep the body "
"awake by creating a collision, applying a force to it, or by disabling the :"
"ref:`can_sleep <class_RigidBody2D_property_can_sleep>` property. Be aware "
"that this can have a negative effect on performance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Contact reporting"

msgid ""
"By default, rigid bodies do not keep track of contacts, because this can "
"require a huge amount of memory if many bodies are in the scene. To enable "
"contact reporting, set the :ref:`contacts_reported "
"<class_RigidBody2D_property_contacts_reported>` property to a non-zero "
"value. The contacts can then be obtained via :ref:`Physics2DDirectBodyState."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When moving a kinematic body, you should not set its ``position`` directly. "
"Instead, you use the ``move_and_collide()`` or ``move_and_slide()`` methods. "

"any collision response must be coded manually."
