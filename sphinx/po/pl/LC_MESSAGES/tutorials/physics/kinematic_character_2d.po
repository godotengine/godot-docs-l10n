"Yes, the name sounds strange. \"Kinematic Character\". What is that? The "
"reason for the name is that, when physics engines came out, they were called "
"\"Dynamics\" engines (because they dealt mainly with collision responses). "
"Many attempts were made to create a character controller using the dynamics "
"engines, but it wasn't as easy as it seemed. Godot has one of the best "
"implementations of dynamic character controller you can find (as it can be "
"seen in the 2d/platformer demo), but using it requires a considerable level "
"of skill and understanding of physics engines (or a lot of patience with "
"trial and error)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some physics engines, such as Havok seem to swear by dynamic character "
"controllers as the best option, while others (PhysX) would rather promote "
"the kinematic one."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, what is the difference?:"
msgstr "Jaka jest więc różnica?:"

msgid ""
"A **dynamic character controller** uses a rigid body with an infinite "
"inertia tensor. It's a rigid body that can't rotate. Physics engines always "
"let objects move and collide, then solve their collisions all together. This "
"makes dynamic character controllers able to interact with other physics "
"objects seamlessly, as seen in the platformer demo. However, these "
"interactions are not always predictable. Collisions can take more than one "
"frame to be solved, so a few collisions may seem to displace a tiny bit. "
"Those problems can be fixed, but require a certain amount of skill."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A **kinematic character controller** is assumed to always begin in a non-"
"colliding state, and will always move to a non-colliding state. If it starts "
"in a colliding state, it will try to free itself like rigid bodies do, but "
"this is the exception, not the rule. This makes their control and motion a "
"lot more predictable and easier to program. However, as a downside, they "
"can't directly interact with other physics objects, unless done by hand in "
"code."

"This short tutorial will focus on the kinematic character controller. "
"Basically, the old-school way of handling collisions (which is not "
"necessarily simpler under the hood, but well hidden and presented as a nice "
"and simple API)."
msgstr ""
"Ten krótki samouczek skoncentruje się na kinematyczny kontrolerze postaci. "
"Zasadniczo, stary sposób obsługi kolizjami (który niekoniecznie jest "
"prostszy pod maską, ale dobrze ukryty i przedstawiony jako ładne i proste "
"API)."

msgid "Physics process"
msgstr "Proces fizyki"

msgid ""
"To manage the logic of a kinematic body or character, it is always advised "
"to use physics process, because it's called before physics step and its "
"execution is in sync with physics server, also it is called the same amount "
"of times per second, always. This makes physics and motion calculation work "
"in a more predictable way than using regular process, which might have "
"spikes or lose precision if the frame rate is too high or too low."

"To have something to test, here's the scene (from the tilemap tutorial): :"
"download:`kbscene.zip <files/kbscene.zip>`. We'll be creating a new scene "
"for the character. Use the robot sprite and create a scene like this:"
msgstr ""
"Oto scena (z samouczka tilemap) : :download:`kbscene.zip <files/kbscene."

"You'll notice that there's a warning icon next to our CollisionShape2D node; "
"that's because we haven't defined a shape for it. Create a new CircleShape2D "
"in the shape property of CollisionShape2D. Click on <CircleShape2D> to go to "
"the options for it, and set the radius to 30:"
msgstr ""
"Zauważysz, że obok naszego węzła CollisionShape2D znajduje się ikona "
"ostrzegawcza, ponieważ nie zdefiniowaliśmy dla niego kształtu. Utwórz nowe "
"koło CircleShape2D we właściwościach kształtu CollisionShape2D. Kliknij na "
"<CircleShape2D>, aby przejść do opcji i ustaw promień na 30:"

msgid ""
"**Note: As mentioned before in the physics tutorial, the physics engine "
"can't handle scale on most types of shapes (only collision polygons, planes "
"and segments work), so always change the parameters (such as radius) of the "
"shape instead of scaling it. The same is also true for the kinematic/rigid/"
"static bodies themselves, as their scale affects the shape scale.**"

"Now, create a script for the character, the one used as an example above "
"should work as a base."
msgstr ""
"Teraz utwórz skrypt dla postaci, ten, który posłużył jako przykład powyżej."

"Finally, instance that character scene in the tilemap, and make the map "
"scene the main one, so it runs when pressing play."
msgstr ""
"Na koniec dodaj scenę postaci do tilemapie, i zrób mapę jako główną scenę, "
"która zostanie uruchomiona natychmiast po naciśnięciu przycisku odtwarzania."

msgid "Moving the kinematic character"
msgstr "Kinematyczna postać (2D)"

msgid ""
"Go back to the character scene, and open the script, the magic begins now! "
"Kinematic body will do nothing by default, but it has a useful function "
"called :ref:`KinematicBody2D.move_and_collide() "
"<class_KinematicBody2D_method_move_and_collide>`. This function takes a :ref:"
"`Vector2 <class_Vector2>` as an argument, and tries to apply that motion to "
"the kinematic body. If a collision happens, it stops right at the moment of "
"the collision."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, let's move our sprite downwards until it hits the floor:"
msgstr "Przesuńmy więc nasz sprite w dół, aż uderzy o podłogę:"

msgid ""
"The result is that the character will move, but stop right when hitting the "
"floor. Pretty cool, huh?"
msgstr ""
"W rezultacie postać będzie się poruszać, ale zatrzyma się bezpośrednio po "
"uderzeniu w podłogę. Nieźle, co?"

msgid ""
"The next step will be adding gravity to the mix, this way it behaves a "
"little more like a regular game character:"

"Now the character falls smoothly. Let's make it walk to the sides, left and "
"right when touching the directional keys. Remember that the values being "
"used (for speed at least) are pixels/second."
msgstr ""
"Teraz postać spada płynnie. Zacznijmy go chodzić na boki, w lewo i w prawo "
"za pomocą strzałek na klawiaturze. Należy pamiętać, że używane wartości "
"(przynajmniej dla prędkości) to piksele/sekundę."

msgid "This adds simple walking support by pressing left and right:"
msgstr ""
"Dodaje to proste poruszanie się poprzez naciskania lewego i prawego klawisza:"

msgid "And give it a try."
msgstr "Spróbuj."

"This is a good starting point for a platformer. A more complete demo can be "
"found in the demo zip distributed with the engine, or in the https://github."
