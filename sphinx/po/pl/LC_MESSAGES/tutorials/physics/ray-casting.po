msgid "Ray-casting"
msgstr ""

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Wprowadzenie"

msgid ""
"One of the most common tasks in game development is casting a ray (or custom "
"shaped object) and checking what it hits. This enables complex behaviors, "
"AI, etc. to take place. This tutorial will explain how to do this in 2D and "
"3D."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot stores all the low level game information in servers, while the scene "
"is just a frontend. As such, ray casting is generally a lower-level task. "
"For simple raycasts, node such as :ref:`RayCast <class_RayCast>` and :ref:"
"`RayCast2D <class_RayCast2D>` will work, as they will return every frame "
"what the result of a raycast is."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many times, though, ray-casting needs to be a more interactive process so a "
"way to do this by code must exist."
msgstr ""

msgid "Space"
msgstr "Przestrzeń"

msgid ""
"In the physics world, Godot stores all the low level collision and physics "
"information in a *space*. The current 2d space (for 2D Physics) can be "
"obtained by accessing :ref:`CanvasItem.get_world_2d().space "
"<class_CanvasItem_method_get_world_2d>`. For 3D, it's :ref:`Spatial."
"get_world().space <class_Spatial_method_get_world>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The resulting space :ref:`RID <class_RID>` can be used in :ref:"
"`PhysicsServer <class_PhysicsServer>` and :ref:`Physics2DServer "
"<class_Physics2DServer>` respectively for 3D and 2D."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing space"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot physics runs by default in the same thread as game logic, but may be "
"set to run on a separate thread to work more efficiently. Due to this, the "
"only time accessing space is safe is during the :ref:`Node."
"_physics_process() <class_Node_method__physics_process>` callback. Accessing "
"it from outside this function may result in an error due to space being "
"*locked*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To perform queries into physics space, the :ref:`Physics2DDirectSpaceState "
"<class_Physics2DDirectSpaceState>` and :ref:`PhysicsDirectSpaceState "
"<class_PhysicsDirectSpaceState>` must be used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use the following code in 2D:"
msgstr "Użyj podanego kodu w 2D:"

msgid "Or more directly:"
msgstr "Lub bardziej bezpośrednio:"

msgid "And in 3D:"
msgstr "W 3D:"

msgid "Raycast query"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For performing a 2D raycast query, the method :ref:"
"`Physics2DDirectSpaceState.intersect_ray() "
"<class_Physics2DDirectSpaceState_method_intersect_ray>` may be used. For "
"example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The result is a dictionary. If the ray didn't hit anything, the dictionary "
"will be empty. If it did hit something, it will contain collision "
"information:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``result`` dictionary when a collision occurs contains the following "
"data:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The data is similar in 3D space, using Vector3 coordinates."
msgstr ""

msgid "Collision exceptions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common use case for ray casting is to enable a character to gather data "
"about the world around it. One problem with this is that the same character "
"has a collider, so the ray will only detect its parent's collider, as shown "
"in the following image:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid self-intersection, the ``intersect_ray()`` function can take an "
"optional third parameter which is an array of exceptions. This is an example "
"of how to use it from a KinematicBody2D or any other collision object node:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The exceptions array can contain objects or RIDs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Collision Mask"
msgstr "Maska kolizji"

msgid ""
"While the exceptions method works fine for excluding the parent body, it "
"becomes very inconvenient if you need a large and/or dynamic list of "
"exceptions. In this case, it is much more efficient to use the collision "
"layer/mask system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The optional fourth argument for ``intersect_ray()`` is a collision mask. "
"For example, to use the same mask as the parent body, use the "
"``collision_mask`` member variable:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See :ref:`doc_physics_introduction_collision_layer_code_example` for details "
"on how to set the collision mask."
msgstr ""

msgid "3D ray casting from screen"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Casting a ray from screen to 3D physics space is useful for object picking. "
"There is not much need to do this because :ref:`CollisionObject "
"<class_CollisionObject>` has an \"input_event\" signal that will let you "
"know when it was clicked, but in case there is any desire to do it manually, "
"here's how."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To cast a ray from the screen, you need a :ref:`Camera <class_Camera>` node. "
"A ``Camera`` can be in two projection modes: perspective and orthogonal. "
"Because of this, both the ray origin and direction must be obtained. This is "
"because ``origin`` changes in orthogonal mode, while ``normal`` changes in "
"perspective mode:"
msgstr ""

msgid "To obtain it using a camera, the following code can be used:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remember that during ``_input()``, the space may be locked, so in practice "
"this query should be run in ``_physics_process()``."
