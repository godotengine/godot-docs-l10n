"One of the most common tasks in game development is casting a ray (or custom "
"shaped object) and checking what it hits. This enables complex behaviors, "
"AI, etc. to take place. This tutorial will explain how to do this in 2D and "
"3D."

"Godot stores all the low level game information in servers, while the scene "
"is just a frontend. As such, ray casting is generally a lower-level task. "
"For simple raycasts, node such as :ref:`RayCast <class_RayCast>` and :ref:"
"`RayCast2D <class_RayCast2D>` will work, as they will return every frame "
"what the result of a raycast is."

"In the physics world, Godot stores all the low level collision and physics "

"A common use case for ray casting is to enable a character to gather data "

"Casting a ray from screen to 3D physics space is useful for object picking. "

"To cast a ray from the screen, you need a :ref:`Camera <class_Camera>` node. "
"A ``Camera`` can be in two projection modes: perspective and orthogonal. "
"Because of this, both the ray origin and direction must be obtained. This is "
"because ``origin`` changes in orthogonal mode, while ``normal`` changes in "
