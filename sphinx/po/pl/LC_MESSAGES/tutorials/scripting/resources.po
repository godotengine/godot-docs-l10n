"Up to this tutorial, we focused on the :ref:`Node <class_Node>` class in "

"ref:`Resource <class_Resource>`."

"*Nodes* give you functionality: they draw sprites, 3D models, simulate "

"When the engine loads a resource from disk, **it only loads it once**. If a "
"copy of that resource is already in memory, trying to load the resource "
"again will return the same copy every time. As resources only contain data, "
"there is no need to duplicate them."
msgstr ""
"W przypadku wczytania zasobu z dysku **jest on zawsze wczytywany raz**. "
"Oznacza to, że jeśli kopia tego zasobu jest już wczytana do pamięci, próba "
"wczytania zasobu ponownie zwróci tę samą kopię za każdym razem tą samą. "
"Odpowiada to temu, że zasoby są tylko kontenerami na dane, więc nie ma "

"Every object, be it a Node or a Resource, can export properties. There are "
"many types of Properties, like String, integer, Vector2, etc., and any of "

msgstr ""
"Zazwyczaj każdy obiekt w Godocie (Węzeł, Zasób lub cokolwiek innego) może "
"eksportować właściwości. Właściwości może być wiele typów (np. string, "
"integer, Vector2 itd.), a jeden z tych typów może być nawet zasobem. Oznacza "
"to, że zarówno węzły, jak i zasoby mogą zawierać inne zasoby jako "
"właściwości. Aby uczynić to trochę bardziej zrozumiałym:"

msgid ""
"The path property tells us where the resource comes from. In this case, it "
"comes from a PNG image called ``robi.png``. When the resource comes from a "
"file like this, it is an external resource. If you erase the path or this "
"path is empty, it becomes a built-in resource."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The switch between built-in and external resources happens when you save the "
"scene. In the example above, if you erase the path ``\"res://robi.png\"`` "
"and save, Godot will save the image inside the ``.tscn`` scene file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Even if you save a built-in resource, when you instance a scene multiple "

msgstr ""

msgid "Loading resources from code"
msgstr "Ładowanie zasobów z kodu"

msgid ""
"There are two ways to load resources from code. First, you can use the "
"``load()`` function anytime:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also ``preload`` resources. Unlike ``load``, this function will read "
"the file from disk and load it at compile-time. As a result, you cannot call "
"``preload`` with a variable path: you need to use a constant string."
msgstr ""

msgid "Loading scenes"
msgstr "Ładowanie scen"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Scenes are also resources, but there is a catch. Scenes saved to disk are "
"resources of type :ref:`PackedScene <class_PackedScene>`. The scene is "
"packed inside a :ref:`Resource <class_Resource>`."
msgstr ""
"Sceny są również zasobami, ale jest pewien haczyk. Sceny zapisane na dysku "
"to zasoby typu :ref:`PackedScene <class_PackedScene>`. Oznacza to, że scena "
"jest zapakowana wewnątrz zasobu."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"To get an instance of the scene, you have to use the :ref:`PackedScene."
"instantiate() <class_PackedScene_method_instantiate>` method."
msgstr ""
"Aby uzyskać przykład sceny, należy użyć metody :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "
"<class_PackedScene_method_instance>`."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"This method creates the nodes in the scene's hierarchy, configures them, and "
"returns the root node of the scene. You can then add it as a child of any "
"other node."
msgstr ""
"Metoda ta tworzy węzły w hierarchii sceny, konfiguruje je (ustawia wszystkie "
"właściwości) i zwraca węzeł główny sceny, który można dodać do dowolnego "
"innego węzła."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The approach has several advantages. As the :ref:`PackedScene.instantiate() "
"<class_PackedScene_method_instantiate>` function is fast, you can create new "
"enemies, bullets, effects, etc. without having to load them again from disk "
"each time. Remember that, as always, images, meshes, etc. are all shared "
"between the scene instances."
msgstr ""
"Podejście to ma kilka zalet. Ponieważ funkcja :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "
"<class_PackedScene_method_instance>` jest dość szybka, dodawanie dodatkowej "
"zawartości do sceny może być wykonane wydajnie. Nowi wrogowie, kule, efekty, "
"itp. mogą być szybko dodawane lub usuwane, bez konieczności ponownego "
"ładowania ich za każdym razem z dysku. Należy pamiętać, że jak zawsze "
"obrazy, siatki itp. są współdzielone pomiędzy instancjami sceny."

msgid "Freeing resources"
msgstr "Zwalnianie zasobów"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"When a :ref:`Resource <class_Resource>` is no longer in use, it will "
"automatically free itself. Since, in most cases, Resources are contained in "
"Nodes, when you free a node, the engine frees all the resources it owns as "
"well if no other node uses them."
msgstr ""
"Zasoby pochodzą z :ref:`Reference <class_Reference>`. W związku z tym, gdy "
"zasób nie jest już używany, zwolni automatycznie się. Ponieważ w większości "
"przypadków zasoby znajdują się w węzłach, skryptach lub innych zasobach, gdy "
"węzeł jest usuwany lub uwalniany, wszystkie zasoby dzieci również są "
"uwalniane."

#, fuzzy
msgid "Creating your own resources"
msgstr "Zwalnianie zasobów"

msgid ""
"Like any Object in Godot, users can also script Resources. Resource scripts "
"inherit the ability to freely translate between object properties and "
"serialized text or binary data (\\*.tres, \\*.res). They also inherit the "
"reference-counting memory management from the Reference type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This comes with many distinct advantages over alternative data structures, "
"such as JSON, CSV, or custom TXT files. Users can only import these assets "
"as a :ref:`Dictionary <class_Dictionary>` (JSON) or as a :ref:`FileAccess "
"<class_FileAccess>` to parse. What sets Resources apart is their inheritance "
"of :ref:`Object <class_Object>`, :ref:`RefCounted <class_RefCounted>`, and :"
"ref:`Resource <class_Resource>` features:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They can define constants, so constants from other data fields or objects "
"are not needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They can define methods, including setter/getter methods for properties. "
"This allows for abstraction and encapsulation of the underlying data. If the "
"Resource script's structure needs to change, the game using the Resource "
"need not also change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They can define signals, so Resources can trigger responses to changes in "
"the data they manage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They have defined properties, so users know 100% that their data will exist."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Resource auto-serialization and deserialization is a built-in Godot Engine "
"feature. Users do not need to implement custom logic to import/export a "
"resource file's data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Resources can even serialize sub-Resources recursively, meaning users can "
"design even more sophisticated data structures."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Users can save Resources as version-control-friendly text files (\\*.tres). "
"Upon exporting a game, Godot serializes resource files as binary files (\\*."
"res) for increased speed and compression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot Engine's Inspector renders and edits Resource files out-of-the-box. As "
"such, users often do not need to implement custom logic to visualize or edit "
"their data. To do so, double-click the resource file in the FileSystem dock "
"or click the folder icon in the Inspector and open the file in the dialog."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They can extend **other** resource types besides just the base Resource."
msgstr ""

msgid "Godot makes it easy to create custom Resources in the Inspector."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a plain Resource object in the Inspector. This can even be a type "
"that derives Resource, so long as your script is extending that type."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the ``script`` property in the Inspector to be your script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Inspector will now display your Resource script's custom properties. If "
"one edits those values and saves the resource, the Inspector serializes the "
"custom properties too! To save a resource from the Inspector, click the "
"Inspector's tools menu (top right), and select \"Save\" or \"Save As...\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the script's language supports :ref:`script classes "
"<doc_gdscript_basics_class_name>`, then it streamlines the process. Defining "
"a name for your script alone will add it to the Inspector's creation dialog. "
"This will auto-add your script to the Resource object you create."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's see some examples. Create a :ref:`Resource <class_Resource>` and name "
"it ``bot_stats``. It should appear in your file tab with the full name "
"``bot_stats.tres``. Without a script, it's useless, so let's add some data "
"and logic! Attach a script to it named ``bot_stats.gd`` (or just create a "
"new script, and then drag it to it)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now, create a :ref:`CharacterBody3D <class_CharacterBody3D>`, name it "
"``Bot``, and add the following script to it:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now, select the :ref:`CharacterBody3D <class_CharacterBody3D>` node which we "
"named ``bot``, and drag&drop the ``bot_stats.tres`` resource onto the "
"Inspector. It should print 10! Obviously, this setup can be used for more "
"advanced features than this, but as long you really understand *how* it all "
"worked, you should figure out everything else related to Resources."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Resource scripts are similar to Unity's ScriptableObjects. The Inspector "
"provides built-in support for custom resources. If desired though, users can "
"even design their own Control-based tool scripts and combine them with an :"
"ref:`EditorPlugin <class_EditorPlugin>` to create custom visualizations and "
"editors for their data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unreal Engine's DataTables and CurveTables are also easy to recreate with "
"Resource scripts. DataTables are a String mapped to a custom struct, similar "
"to a Dictionary mapping a String to a secondary custom Resource script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of inlining the Dictionary values, one could also, alternatively:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Import a table of values from a spreadsheet and generate these key-value "
"pairs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Design a visualization within the editor and create a plugin that adds it to "
"the Inspector when you open these types of Resources."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CurveTables are the same thing, except mapped to an Array of float values or "
"a :ref:`Curve <class_Curve>`/:ref:`Curve2D <class_Curve2D>` resource object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Beware that resource files (\\*.tres/\\*.res) will store the path of the "
"script they use in the file. When loaded, they will fetch and load this "
"script as an extension of their type. This means that trying to assign a "
"subclass, i.e. an inner class of a script (such as using the ``class`` "
"keyword in GDScript) won't work. Godot will not serialize the custom "
"properties on the script subclass properly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the example below, Godot would load the ``Node`` script, see that it "
"doesn't extend ``Resource``, and then determine that the script failed to "
"load for the Resource object since the types are incompatible."
