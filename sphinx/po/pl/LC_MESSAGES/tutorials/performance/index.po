"Godot follows a balanced performance philosophy. In the performance world, "
"there are always tradeoffs, which consist of trading speed for usability and "
"flexibility. Some practical examples of this are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rendering large amounts of objects efficiently is easy, but when a large "
"scene must be rendered, it can become inefficient. To solve this, visibility "
"computation must be added to the rendering. This makes rendering less "
"efficient, but at the same time, fewer objects are rendered. Therefore, the "
"overall rendering efficiency is improved."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Configuring the properties of every material for every object that needs to "
"be rendered is also slow. To solve this, objects are sorted by material to "
"reduce the costs. At the same time, sorting has a cost."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In 3D physics, a similar situation happens. The best algorithms to handle "
"large amounts of physics objects (such as SAP) are slow at insertion/removal "
"of objects and raycasting. Algorithms that allow faster insertion and "
"removal, as well as raycasting, will not be able to handle as many active "
"objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And there are many more examples of this! Game engines strive to be general-"
"purpose in nature. Balanced algorithms are always favored over algorithms "
"that might be fast in some situations and slow in others, or algorithms that "
"are fast but are more difficult to use."

msgid ""
"Godot is not an exception to this. While it is designed to have backends "
"swappable for different algorithms, the default backends prioritize balance "
"and flexibility over performance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With this clear, the aim of this tutorial section is to explain how to get "
"the maximum performance out of Godot. While the tutorials can be read in any "
"order, it is a good idea to start from :ref:`doc_general_optimization`."
