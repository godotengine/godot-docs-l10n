"You might want to change the appearance of the mouse cursor in your game in "
"order to suit the overall design. There are two ways to customize the mouse "
"cursor:"

"You could display a \"software\" mouse cursor by hiding the mouse cursor and "
"moving a Sprite to the cursor position in a ``_process`` method, but this "
"will add at least one frame of latency compared to an \"hardware\" mouse "
"cursor. Therefore, it's recommended to use the approach described here "
"whenever possible."

msgid ""
"If you have to use the \"software\" approach, consider adding an "
"extrapolation step to better display the actual mouse input."

"and Custom Image Hotspot."
