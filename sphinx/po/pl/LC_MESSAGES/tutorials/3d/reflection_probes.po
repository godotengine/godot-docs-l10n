msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Wprowadzenie"

msgid ""
"As stated in the :ref:`doc_spatial_material`, objects can show reflected or "
"diffuse light. Reflection probes are used as a source of reflected and "
"ambient light for objects inside their area of influence."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A probe of this type captures the surroundings (as a sort of 360 degrees "
"image), and stores versions of it with increasing levels of *blur*. This is "
"used to simulate roughness in materials, as well as ambient lighting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While these probes are an efficient way of storing reflections, they have a "
"few shortcomings:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They are efficient to render, but expensive to compute. This leads to a "
"default behavior where they only capture on scene load."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They work best for rectangular shaped rooms or places, otherwise the "
"reflections shown are not as faithful (especially when roughness is 0)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting up"
msgstr "Konfigurowanie"

msgid ""
"Create a ReflectionProbe node and wrap it around the area where you want to "
"have reflections:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This should result in immediate local reflections. If you are using a Sky "
"texture, reflections are by default blended with it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, on interiors, reflections may appear not to have much "
"consistence. In this scenario, make sure to tick the *\"Box Correct\"* "
"property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This setting changes the reflection from an infinite skybox to reflecting a "
"box the size of the probe:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Adjusting the box walls may help improve the reflection a bit, but it will "
"always look best in box shaped rooms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The probe captures the surrounding from the center of the gizmo. If, for "
"some reason, the room shape or contents occlude the center, it can be "
"displaced to an empty place by moving the handles in the center:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, shadow mapping is disabled when rendering probes (only in the "
"rendered image inside the probe, not the actual scene). This is a simple way "
"to save on performance and memory. If you want shadows in the probe, they "
"can be toggled on/off with the *Enable Shadow* setting:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, keep in mind that you may not want the Reflection Probe to render "
"some objects. A typical scenario is an enemy inside the room which will move "
"around. To keep objects from being rendered in the reflections, use the "
"*Cull Mask* setting:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Interior vs exterior"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are using reflection probes in an interior setting, it is recommended "
"that the **Interior** property be enabled. This stops the probe from "
"rendering the sky and also allows custom ambient lighting settings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When probes are set to **Interior**, custom constant ambient lighting can be "
"specified per probe. Just choose a color and an energy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Optionally, you can blend this ambient light with the probe diffuse capture "
"by tweaking the **Ambient Contribution** property (0.0 means pure ambient "
"color, while 1.0 means pure diffuse capture)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Blending"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiple reflection probes can be used, and Godot will blend them where they "
"overlap using a smart algorithm:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see, this blending is never perfect (after all, these are box "
"reflections, not real reflections), but these artifacts are only visible "
"when using perfectly mirrored reflections. Normally, scenes have normal "
"mapping and varying levels of roughness, which can hide this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, Reflection Probes work well blended together with Screen "
"Space Reflections to solve these problems. Combining them makes local "
"reflections appear more faithful, while probes are only used as a fallback "
"when no screen-space information is found:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, blending interior and exterior probes is the recommended approach "
"when making levels that combine both interiors and exteriors. Near the door, "
"a probe can be marked as *exterior* (so it will get sky reflections) while "
"on the inside, it can be interior."

msgid "Reflection atlas"
msgstr "Odbicie"

msgid ""
"In the current renderer implementation, all probes are the same size and are "
"fit into a Reflection Atlas. The size and amount of probes can be customized "
"in Project Settings -> Quality -> Reflections"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default setting of Atlas Subdiv: 8 will allow up to 16 reflection probes "
"in a scene. This value needs to be increased if you need more reflection "
"probes."
