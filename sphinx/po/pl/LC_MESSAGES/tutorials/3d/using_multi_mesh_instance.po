"In a normal scenario, you would use a :ref:`MeshInstance "
"<class_MeshInstance>` node to display a 3D mesh like a human model for the "
"main character, but in some cases, you would like to create multiple "
"instances of the same mesh in a scene. You *could* duplicate the same node "
"multiple times and adjust the transforms manually. This may be a tedious "
"process and the result may look mechanical. Also, this method is not "
"conducive to rapid iterations. :ref:`MultiMeshInstance "
"<class_MultiMeshInstance>` is one of the possible solutions to this problem."

msgid ""
"MultiMeshInstance, as the name suggests, creates multiple copies of a "
"MeshInstance over a surface of a specific mesh. An example would be having a "
"tree mesh populate a landscape mesh with trees of random scales and "
"orientations."

msgid "Setting up the nodes"

msgid ""
"The basic setup requires three nodes: the MultiMeshInstance node and two "
"MeshInstance nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One node is used as the target, the mesh that you want to place multiple "
"meshes on. In the tree example, this would be the landscape."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The other node is used as the source, the mesh that you want to have "
"duplicated. In the tree case, this would be the tree itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our example, we would use a :ref:`Spatial <class_Spatial>` node as the "
"root node of the scene. Your scene tree would look like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "For simplicity's sake, this tutorial uses built-in primitives."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you have everything ready. Select the MultiMeshInstance node and look at "
"the toolbar, you should see an extra button called ``MultiMesh`` next to "
"``View``. Click it and select *Populate surface* in the dropdown menu. A new "
"window titled *Populate MultiMesh* will pop up."

msgid ""
"Select the target surface. In the tree case, this should be the landscape "
"node. The source mesh should be the tree node. Adjust the other parameters "
"according to your preference. Press ``Populate`` and multiple copies of the "
"source mesh will be placed over the target mesh. If you are satisfied with "
"the result, you can delete the mesh instance used as the source mesh."
