"If you have never made 3D games before, working with rotations in three "
"dimensions can be confusing at first. Coming from 2D, the natural way of "
"thinking is along the lines of *\"Oh, it's just like rotating in 2D, except "
"now rotations happen in X, Y and Z\"*."
msgstr ""
"Gdy pierwszy raz tworzymy grę 3D, praca z rotacjami może się okazać "
"skomplikowana. Osoby pracujące wcześniej w 2D mogą pomyśleć, że jest *„to "
"samo co w 2D, z tym że obracamy wokół osi X, Y i Z”*."

"At first, this seems easy. For simple games, this way of thinking may even "
"be enough. Unfortunately, it's often incorrect."
msgstr ""
"Z początku może się to wydawać proste i oczywiste. Dla prostych gier taki "
"sposób myślenia czasem wystarczy. Niestety, często jest on nieprawidłowy."

msgid ""
"Angles in three dimensions are most commonly referred to as \"Euler Angles\"."
msgstr "Kąty obracające w trzech wymiarach zwykle nazywa się „kątami Eulera”."

msgid ""
"Euler angles were introduced by mathematician Leonhard Euler in the early "
"1700s."
msgstr ""
"Kąty Eulera zostały wprowadzone przez matematyka Leonarda Eulera na początku "
"osiemnastego wieku."

msgid ""
"This way of representing 3D rotations was groundbreaking at the time, but it "
"has several shortcomings when used in game development (which is to be "
"expected from a guy with a funny hat). The idea of this document is to "
"explain why, as well as outlining best practices for dealing with transforms "
"when programming 3D games."

msgid "Problems of Euler angles"
msgstr "Problemy z kątami Eulera"

msgid ""
"While it may seem intuitive that each axis has a rotation, the truth is that "
"it's just not practical."
msgstr ""
"Obracanie wokół poszczególnych osi może i wydaje się intuicyjne, ale jest "
"niepraktyczne."

msgid "Axis order"
msgstr "Kolejność osi"

msgid ""
"The main reason for this is that there isn't a *unique* way to construct an "
"orientation from the angles. There isn't a standard mathematical function "
"that takes all the angles together and produces an actual 3D rotation. The "
"only way an orientation can be produced from angles is to rotate the object "
"angle by angle, in an *arbitrary order*."
msgstr ""
"Głównym problemem jest brak jednej, konsekwentnej metody wyznaczającej "
"orientację na podstawie kątów. Nie ma w matematyce zwyczajnej funkcji, która "
"dla trzech kątów stworzy nam obrót w 3D. Jedyne, co możemy zrobić, to "
"wykonać kolejne obroty, jeden po drugim, w *pewnej kolejności*."

msgid ""
"This could be done by first rotating in *X*, then *Y* and then in *Z*. "
"Alternatively, you could first rotate in *Y*, then in *Z* and finally in "
"*X*. Anything works, but depending on the order, the final orientation of "
"the object will *not necessarily be the same*. Indeed, this means that there "
"are several ways to construct an orientation from 3 different angles, "
"depending on *the order of the rotations*."
msgstr ""
"Możemy najpierw obrócić wokół osi *X*, potem *Y*, a następnie *Z*. Możemy "
"też wybrać najpierw oś *Y*, potem *Z* i na końcu *X*. Tak czy inaczej obrót "
"się wykona, ale w zależności od przyjętej kolejności *rezultat niekoniecznie "
"będzie ten sam*. To oznacza, że mamy kilka sposobów na wyznaczenie "
"orientacji na podstawie trzech kątów, różniących się *kolejnością "
"poszczególnych rotacji*."

msgid ""
"Following is a visualization of rotation axes (in X, Y, Z order) in a gimbal "
"(from Wikipedia). As you can see, the orientation of each axis depends on "
"the rotation of the previous one:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may be wondering how this affects you. Let's look at a practical example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Imagine you are working on a first-person controller (e.g. an FPS game). "
"Moving the mouse left and right controls your view angle parallel to the "
"ground, while moving it up and down moves the player's view up and down."
msgstr ""
"Wyobraź sobie, że pracujesz nad kamerą pierwszoosobową (np. w FPS-ie). "
"Poruszanie myszką w lewo i prawo powinno obracać widok równolegle do ziemi. "
"Ruch myszką w górę i w dół oznacza natomiast patrzenie się w górę i w dół."

msgid ""
"In this case to achieve the desired effect, rotation must be applied first "
"in the *Y* axis (\"up\" in this case, since Godot uses a \"Y-Up\" "
"orientation), followed by rotation in the *X* axis."
msgstr ""
"Żeby osiągnąć zamierzony efekt, trzeba najpierw obrócić wokół osi *Y* (w "
"Godocie oś *Y* jest skierowana ku górze), a następnie wokół osi *X*."

msgid ""
"If we were to apply rotation in the *X* axis first, and then in *Y*, the "
"effect would be undesired:"
msgstr ""
"Jeżeli zrobimy to w odwrotnej kolejności, tj. najpierw oś *X*, a następnie "
"*Y*, uzyskamy coś nieoczekiwanego:"

msgid ""
"Depending on the type of game or effect desired, the order in which you want "
"axis rotations to be applied may differ. Therefore, applying rotations in X, "
"Y, and Z is not enough: you also need a *rotation order*."
msgstr ""
"W zależności od rodzaju gry lub zamierzonego efektu, pożądana kolejność "
"obrotów może być różna. W związku z tym, nie można zwyczajnie obracać po X, "
"Y i Z. *Kolejność obrotów* trzeba doprecyzować."

msgid "Interpolation"
msgstr "Interpolacja"

msgid ""
"Another problem with using Euler angles is interpolation. Imagine you want "
"to transition between two different camera or enemy positions (including "
"rotations). One logical way to approach this is to interpolate the angles "
"from one position to the next. One would expect it to look like this:"
msgstr ""
"Kolejnym problemem z kątami Eulera jest interpolacja. Załóżmy, że chcemy "
"płynnie przejść między dwoma położeniami kamery, czy przeciwników (włącznie "
"z rotacjami). Najprostszy sposób to interpolowanie każdego kąta z "
"pierwotnego do docelowego. Rezultat ma wyglądać tak:"

msgid "But this does not always have the expected effect when using angles:"
msgstr "Ale gdy używamy kątów, efekt może być inny:"

msgid "The camera actually rotated the opposite direction!"
msgstr "Kamera obróciła się w przeciwnym kierunku!"

msgid "There are a few reasons this may happen:"
msgstr "Mogły się wydarzyć następujące rzeczy:"

msgid ""
"Rotations don't map linearly to orientation, so interpolating them does not "
"always result in the shortest path (i.e., to go from ``270`` to ``0`` "
"degrees is not the same as going from ``270`` to ``360``, even though the "
"angles are equivalent)."
msgstr ""
"Przekształcenie z obrotu do orientacji nie jest liniowe. Interpolacja może "
"pójść dłuższą drogą (np. zmiana kąta z ``270`` do ``0`` stopni przebiega "
"inaczej niż z ``270`` do ``360``, mimo iż kąty są równoważne)."

msgid ""
"Gimbal lock is at play (first and last rotated axis align, so a degree of "
"freedom is lost). See `Wikipedia's page on Gimbal Lock <https://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Gimbal_lock>`_ for a detailed explanation of this problem."

"The result of all this is that you should **not use** the ``rotation`` "
"property of :ref:`class_Node3D` nodes in Godot for games. It's there to be "
"used mainly in the editor, for coherence with the 2D engine, and for simple "
"rotations (generally just one axis, or even two in limited cases). As much "
"as you may be tempted, don't use it."
msgstr ""
"Dlatego zaleca się **nie używać** własności ``rotation`` z węzłów :ref:"
"`class_Spatial`. Istnieje, by była widoczna w edytorze, a także dla "
"zachowania spójności z częścią 2D silnika. Nadaje się jedynie do prostych "

msgid "Introducing transforms"
msgstr "Macierze i transformacje"

msgid ""
"Godot uses the :ref:`class_Transform3D` datatype for orientations. Each :ref:"
"`class_Node3D` node contains a ``transform`` property which is relative to "
"the parent's transform, if the parent is a Node3D-derived type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is also possible to access the world coordinate transform via the "
"``global_transform`` property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A transform has a :ref:`class_Basis` (transform.basis sub-property), which "
"consists of three :ref:`class_Vector3` vectors. These are accessed via the "
"``transform.basis`` property and can be accessed directly by ``transform."
"basis.x``, ``transform.basis.y``, and ``transform.basis.z``. Each vector "
"points in the direction its axis has been rotated, so they effectively "
"describe the node's total rotation. The scale (as long as it's uniform) can "
"also be inferred from the length of the axes. A *basis* can also be "
"interpreted as a 3x3 matrix and used as ``transform.basis[x][y]``."
msgstr ""

msgid "A default basis (unmodified) is akin to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is also an analog of a 3x3 identity matrix."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Following the OpenGL convention, ``X`` is the *Right* axis, ``Y`` is the "
"*Up* axis and ``Z`` is the *Forward* axis."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Together with the *basis*, a transform also has an *origin*. This is a "
"*Vector3* specifying how far away from the actual origin ``(0, 0, 0)`` this "
"transform is. Combining the *basis* with the *origin*, a *transform* "
"efficiently represents a unique translation, rotation, and scale in space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One way to visualize a transform is to look at an object's 3D gizmo while in "
"\"local space\" mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The gizmo's arrows show the ``X``, ``Y``, and ``Z`` axes (in red, green, and "
"blue respectively) of the basis, while the gizmo's center is at the object's "
"origin."

msgid "Precision errors"
msgstr "Precyzja"

msgid ""
"Doing successive operations on transforms will result in a loss of precision "
"due to floating-point error. This means the scale of each axis may no longer "
"be exactly ``1.0``, and they may not be exactly ``90`` degrees from each "
"other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a transform is rotated every frame, it will eventually start deforming "
"over time. This is unavoidable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two different ways to handle this. The first is to "
"*orthonormalize* the transform after some time (maybe once per frame if you "
"modify it every frame):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will make all axes have ``1.0`` length again and be ``90`` degrees from "
"each other. However, any scale applied to the transform will be lost."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is recommended you not scale nodes that are going to be manipulated; "
"scale their children nodes instead (such as MeshInstance3D). If you "
"absolutely must scale the node, then re-apply it at the end:"

"You might be thinking at this point: **\"Ok, but how do I get angles from a "

"Interpolating between two transforms can efficiently be done with "
"quaternions. More information about how quaternions work can be found in "
"other places around the Internet. For practical use, it's enough to "
"understand that pretty much their main use is doing a closest path "
"interpolation. As in, if you have two rotations, a quaternion will smoothly "
"allow interpolation between them using the closest axis."

msgid "Converting a rotation to quaternion is straightforward."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ref:`class_Quaternion` type reference has more information on the "
"datatype (it can also do transform accumulation, transform points, etc., "
