msgid "Using ImmediateGeometry"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike the SurfaceTool or ArrayMesh, :ref:`ImmediateGeometry "
"<class_ImmediateGeometry>` is an actual node. Being a node makes it quick to "
"add to a scene and get visual output. It uses an OpenGL 1.x-style API like "
"SurfaceTool, but it's actually designed to create meshes on the fly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generating complex geometry (several thousand vertices) with this node is "
"inefficient, even if it's done only once. Instead, it is designed to "
"generate simple geometry that changes every frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before starting, you should clear the geometry by calling ``clear()``. This "
"ensures that you are not building upon the geometry from the previous frame. "
"If you want to keep geometry between frames, do not call ``clear()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To begin generating geometry you must call ``begin()``. ``begin()`` takes a "
"``PrimitiveType`` as an argument. ``PrimitiveType`` is an OpenGL concept "
"that instructs the GPU how to arrange the primitive based on the vertices "
"given whether it is triangles, lines, points, etc. A complete list can be "
"found under the :ref:`Mesh <class_mesh>` class reference page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you have called ``begin()`` you are ready to start adding vertices. You "
"add vertices one at a time. First you add vertex specific attributes such as "
"normals or UVs using ``set_****()`` (e.g. ``set_normal()``). Then you call "
"``add_vertex()`` to add a vertex with those attributes. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only attributes added before the call to ``add_vertex()`` will be included "
"in that vertex."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, once you have added all your vertices call ``end()`` to signal that "
"you have finished generating the mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid "The example code below draws a single triangle."
msgstr "Oto prosty przykład jak to działa."
