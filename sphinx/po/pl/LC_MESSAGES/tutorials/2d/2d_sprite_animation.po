"In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create 2D animated characters with the "
"AnimatedSprite class and the AnimationPlayer. Typically, when you create or "
"download an animated character, it will come in one of two ways: as "
"individual images or as a single sprite sheet containing all the animation's "
"frames. Both can be animated in Godot with the AnimatedSprite class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, we'll use :ref:`AnimatedSprite <class_AnimatedSprite>` to animate a "
"collection of individual images. Then we will animate a sprite sheet using "
"this class. Finally, we will learn another way to animate a sprite sheet "
"with :ref:`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>` and the *Animation* "
"property of :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>`."

"In this scenario, you have a collection of images, each containing one of "
"your character's animation frames. For this example, we'll use the following "
"animation:"

"You can download the images here: :download:`run_animation.zip <files/"

"Gotowy projekt dla tej części można pobrać tutaj: :download:"

msgid ""
"Unzip the images and place them in your project folder. Set up your scene "
"tree with the following nodes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The root node could also be :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` or :ref:"
"`RigidBody2D <class_RigidBody2D>`. The animation will still be made in the "
"same way. Once the animation is completed, you can assign a shape to the "
"CollisionShape2D. See :ref:`Physics Introduction <doc_physics_introduction>` "
"for more information."

"Now select the ``AnimatedSprite`` and in its *SpriteFrames* property, select "
"\"New SpriteFrames\"."

"Click on the new SpriteFrames resource and you'll see a new panel appear at "
"the bottom of the editor window:"

"From the FileSystem dock on the left side, drag the 8 individual images into "
"the center part of the SpriteFrames panel. On the left side, change the name "
"of the animation from \"default\" to \"run\"."

"Back in the Inspector, check the box for the *Playing* property. You should "
"now see the animation playing in the viewport. However, it is a bit slow. To "
"fix this, change the *Speed (FPS)* setting in the SpriteFrames panel to 10."

"Once the animation is complete, you can control the animation via code using "

"A new window will open, showing your sprite sheet. The first thing you will "

msgid ""
"Another way that you can animate when using a sprite sheet is to use a "
"standard :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` node to display the texture, and then "
"animating the change from texture to texture with :ref:`AnimationPlayer "
"<class_AnimationPlayer>`."

msgid ""
"Drag the spritesheet into the Sprite's *Texture* property, and you'll see "
"the whole sheet displayed on the screen. To slice it up into individual "
"frames, expand the *Animation* section in the Inspector and set the "
"*Hframes* to ``6``. *Hframes* and *Vframes* are the number of horizontal and "
"vertical frames in your sprite sheet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now try changing the value of the *Frame* property. You'll see that it "

"Select the ``AnimationPlayer`` and click the \"Animation\" button followed "

"Like with AnimatedSprite, you can control the animation via code using the "
"``play()`` and ``stop()`` methods. Again, here is an example to play the "
"animation while the right arrow key is held, and stop it when the key is "
"released."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If updating both an animation and a separate property at once (for example, "
"a platformer may update the sprite's ``h_flip``/``v_flip`` properties when a "
"character turns while starting a 'turning' animation), it's important to "
"keep in mind that ``play()`` isn't applied instantly. Instead, it's applied "
"the next time the :ref:`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>` is "
"processed. This may end up being on the next frame, causing a 'glitch' "
"frame, where the property change was applied but the animation was not. If "
"this turns out to be a problem, after calling ``play()``, you can call "
"``advance(0)`` to update the animation immediately."
msgstr ""

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "Podsumowanie"

msgid ""
"These examples illustrate the two classes you can use in Godot for 2D "
"animation. ``AnimationPlayer`` is a bit more complex than "
"``AnimatedSprite``, but it provides additional functionality, since you can "
"also animate other properties like position or scale. The class "
"``AnimationPlayer`` can also be used with an ``AnimatedSprite``. Experiment "
"to see what works best for your needs."
