msgid "Viewport and Canvas items"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` is the base for all 2D nodes, be it "
"regular 2D nodes, such as :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>`, or :ref:`Control "
"<class_Control>`. Both inherit from :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>`. "
"You can arrange canvas items in trees. Each item will inherit its parent's "
"transform: when the parent moves, its children move too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CanvasItem nodes, and nodes inheriting from them, are direct or indirect "
"children of a :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`, that display them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Viewport has the property :ref:`Viewport.canvas_transform "
"<class_Viewport_property_canvas_transform>`, allows to apply a custom :ref:"
"`Transform2D <class_Transform2D>` transform to the CanvasItem hierarchy it "
"contains. Nodes such as :ref:`Camera2D <class_Camera2D>` work by changing "
"that transform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To achieve effects like scrolling, manipulating the canvas transform "
"property is more efficient than moving the root canvas item and the entire "
"scene with it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Usually though, we don't want *everything* in the game or app to be subject "
"to the canvas transform. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Parallax Backgrounds**: Backgrounds that move slower than the rest of the "
"stage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**UI**: Think of a user interface (UI) or head-up display (HUD) superimposed "
"on our view of the game world. We want a life counter, score display and "
"other elements to retain their screen positions even when our view of the "
"game world changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Transitions**: We may want visual effects used for transitions (fades, "
"blends) to remain at a fixed screen location."
msgstr ""

msgid "How can these problems be solved in a single scene tree?"
msgstr "Jak mogę to rozwiązać w pojedynczej scenie drzewa?"

msgid "CanvasLayers"
msgstr "CanvasLayers"

msgid ""
"The answer is :ref:`CanvasLayer <class_CanvasLayer>`, which is a node that "
"adds a separate 2D rendering layer for all its children and grand-children. "
"Viewport children will draw by default at layer \"0\", while a CanvasLayer "
"will draw at any numeric layer. Layers with a greater number will be drawn "
"above those with a smaller number. CanvasLayers also have their own "
"transform and do not depend on the transform of other layers. This allows "
"the UI to be fixed in screen-space while our view on the game world changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An example of this is creating a parallax background. This can be done with "
"a CanvasLayer at layer \"-1\". The screen with the points, life counter and "
"pause button can also be created at layer \"1\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's a diagram of how it looks:"
msgstr "Tutaj jest diagram i jak powinien wyglądać:"

msgid ""
"CanvasLayers are independent of tree order, and they only depend on their "
"layer number, so they can be instantiated when needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CanvasLayers aren't necessary to control the drawing order of nodes. The "
"standard way to ensuring that a node is  correctly drawn 'in front' or "
"'behind' others is to manipulate the order of the nodes in the scene panel. "
"Perhaps counterintuitively, the topmost nodes in the scene panel are drawn "
"on *behind* lower ones in the viewport. 2d nodes also have a property for "
"controlling their drawing order (see :ref:`Node2D.z_index "
"<class_Node2D_property_z_index>`)."
