"A tilemap is a grid of tiles used to create a game's layout. There are "
"several benefits to using :ref:`TileMap <class_TileMap>` nodes to design "
"your levels. First, they make it possible to draw the layout by \"painting\" "
"the tiles onto a grid, which is much faster than placing individual :ref:"
"`Sprite <class_Sprite>` nodes one by one. Second, they allow for much larger "
"levels because they are optimized for drawing large numbers of tiles. "
"Finally, you can add collision, occlusion, and navigation shapes to tiles, "
"adding additional functionality to the TileMap."

"This demo will use the following tiles taken from Kenney's \"Abstract "

"set."

"When using a tileset, it's important that adjacent tiles match up. Godot's "
"default is to import 2D images using an interpolated \"filter\" mode, which "
"will result in ugly borders between the tiles. Select the image and click "
"the Import tab. Turn off ``Filter`` and click \"Reimport\". See :ref:"
"`doc_import_images` for details."

"Add a new :ref:`TileMap <class_TileMap>` node to the scene. By default, a "

"\"Isometric\" mode or define your own custom tile shape."

"Under the \"Cell\" section in the Inspector are many properties you can "

msgid "``Cell Size``"
msgstr "Center"

msgid ""
"This defines the size of the grid. This should match the pixel size of your "
"tiles. The default value is ``(64, 64)``."
msgstr ""

msgid "``YSort``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This causes tiles to be drawn in order of their ``Y`` position, so that "
"\"lower\" tiles are drawn on top of \"higher\" ones."
msgstr ""

msgid "``Half Offset`` and ``Tile Origin``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These properties affect the position of the tile relative to the grid "
"position."

msgid "Creating a TileSet"
msgstr "Tworzenie motywu"

msgid ""
"Once you've configured your tilemap, it's time to add a :ref:`TileSet "
"<class_TileSet>`. A TileSet is a :ref:`Resource <class_Resource>` that "
"contains the data about your tiles - their   textures, collision shapes, and "
"other properties. When the game runs, the TileMap combines the individual "
"tiles into a single object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add a new TileSet, click on the \"Tile Set\" property and select \"New "
"TileSet\"."

"entire tile. A yellow rectangle appears around the selected tile."

msgid "Collision shapes"
msgstr "Kształty kolizji"

msgid ""
"If you're making a map that needs collisions - walls, floor, or other "
"obstacles, for example - then you'll need to add collision shapes to any "
"tiles that you want to be considered \"solid\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click \"TileSet\" at the bottom of the editor window to return to the "
"tileset tool. Click the tile you previously defined (outlined in yellow). "
"Select the \"Collision\" tab and click the \"Create a new rectangle\" "
"button. Make sure you still have grid snap enabled, then click and drag in "
"the tile. A square collision shape appears in light blue:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can add occlusion and navigation shapes to the tile in the same way."
msgstr ""

msgid "Atlas tiles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rather than adding individual tiles one at a time, you can define a group of "
"tiles all at once using an atlas. This also allows you to randomly generate "
"tiles from the group."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click \"New Atlas\" and drag to select the entire tile sheet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you haven't already, make sure to change the \"Step\" in the snap "
"settings to `(64, 64)`, or your tiles may be chopped into smaller pieces. "
"You can find this in the Inspector:"

msgid ""
"Once you've defined the atlas you can add collision shapes to the individual "
"tiles as before. You can also click \"Icon\" to select one of the tiles to "
"represent the atlas."

msgid ""
"Back in the TileMap, you can select the atlas tile and you'll see all of the "
"tiles it contains:"

msgid ""
"In addition to saving time when defining the tiles, this can help by "
"grouping similar tiles together when you're working with a large number of "
"tiles."
msgstr ""

msgid "Random tile priorities"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When drawing with atlas tiles, enabling the \"Use priority\" option causes "
"tiles to be selected at random. By default, each tile in the tileset has an "
"equal likelihood of occurring. You can change the likelihood by setting "
"different priorities for each tile. For example, a tile with priority 2 is "
"twice as likely to be selected as a tile with priority 1, and a tile with "
"priority 3 is 50% more likely to be selected than a tile with priority 2."
msgstr ""

msgid "Autotiles"

"Autotiles allow you to define a group of tiles, then add rules to control "
"which tile gets used for drawing based on the content of adjacent cells."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click \"New Autotile\" and drag to select the tiles you wish to use. You can "
"add collisions, occlusion, navigation shapes, tile priorties, and select an "
"icon tile in the same manner as for atlas tiles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tile selection is controlled by bitmasks. Bitmasks can be added by clicking "
"\"Bitmask\", then clicking parts of the tiles to add or remove bits in the "
"mask. Left-clicking an area of the tile adds a bit, right-click removes "
"\"off\", and shift-left-click sets an \"ignore\" bit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whenever Godot updates a cell using an autotile, it first creates a pattern "
"based on which adjacent cells are already set. Then, it searches the "
"autotile for a single tile with a bitmask matching the created pattern. If "
"no matching bitmask is found, the \"icon\" tile will be used instead. If "
"more than one matching bitmask is found, one of them will be selected "
"randomly, using the tile priorities."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The rules for matching a bitmask to a pattern depend on the tileset's "
"autotile bitmask mode. This can be set in the \"Inspector\" tab, under the "
"\"Selected Tile\" heading. Allowed values are \"2x2\", \"3x3 (minimal)\", "
"and \"3x3\"."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Where a bit is \"on\", all cells connected to that corner must be filled "
"using the same autotile, in order for the bitmask to match. For example, if "
"the top-left bit is set, the cell directly above, directly left, and "
"diagonally above-left must be filled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Where a bit is \"off\", at least one cell connected to that corner must not "

"function will be called for each adjacent cell that does not contain the "
"same autotile, and should return true if you want the drawn cell to \"bind\" "
