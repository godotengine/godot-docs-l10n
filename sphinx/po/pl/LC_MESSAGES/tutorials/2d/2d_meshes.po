"In 3D, meshes are used to display the world. In 2D, they are rare as images "
"are used more often. Godot's 2D engine is a pure two-dimensional engine, so "
"it can't really display 3D meshes directly (although it can be done via "
"``Viewport`` and ``ViewportTexture``)."

"2D meshes are meshes that contain two-dimensional geometry (Z can be omitted "
"or ignored) instead of 3D. You can experiment creating them yourself using "
"``SurfaceTool`` from code and displaying them in a ``MeshInstance2D`` node."

"This workflow is useful for optimizing 2D drawing in some situations. When "
