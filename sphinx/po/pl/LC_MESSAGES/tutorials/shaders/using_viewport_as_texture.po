"Next, disable HDR and disable 3D. We don't need HDR because our planet's "

"Notice the ugly seam that forms where the texture wraps around? This is "
"because we are picking a color based on UV coordinates and UV coordinates do "
"not wrap around the texture. This is a classic problem in 2D map projection. "
"Game developers often have a 2-dimensional map they want to project onto a "
"sphere, but when it wraps around, it has large seams. There is an elegant "
"workaround for this problem that we will illustrate in the next section."

msgid ""
"So now, when we render to our :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`, it appears "
"magically on the sphere. But there is an ugly seam created by our texture "
"coordinates. So how do we get a range of coordinates that wrap around the "
"sphere in a nice way? One solution is to use a function that repeats on the "
"domain of our texture. ``sin`` and ``cos`` are two such functions. Let's "
"apply them to the texture and see what happens."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Not too bad. If you look around, you can see that the seam has now "
"disappeared, but in its place, we have pinching at the poles. This pinching "
"is due to the way Godot maps textures to spheres in its :ref:"
"`StandardMaterial3D <class_StandardMaterial3D>`. It uses a projection "
"technique called equirectangular projection, which translates a spherical "
"map onto a 2D plane."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are interested in a little extra information on the technique, we "
"will be converting from spherical coordinates into Cartesian coordinates. "
"Spherical coordinates map the longitude and latitude of the sphere, while "
"Cartesian coordinates are, for all intents and purposes, a vector from the "
"center of the sphere to the point."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For each pixel, we will calculate its 3D position on the sphere. From that, "
"we will use 3D noise to determine a color value. By calculating the noise in "
"3D, we solve the problem of the pinching at the poles. To understand why, "
"picture the noise being calculated across the surface of the sphere instead "
"of across the 2D plane. When you calculate across the surface of the sphere, "
"you never hit an edge, and hence you never create a seam or a pinch point on "
"the pole. The following code converts the ``UVs`` into Cartesian coordinates."
msgstr ""

msgid "And if we use ``unit`` as an output ``COLOR`` value, we get:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now that we can calculate the 3D position of the surface of the sphere, we "
"can use 3D noise to make the planet. We will be using this noise function "
"directly from a `Shadertoy <https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xsl3Dl>`_:"

msgid ""
"Now to make the planet colors. While there are many ways to do this, for "
"now, we will stick with a gradient between water and land."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make a gradient in GLSL, we use the ``mix`` function. ``mix`` takes two "
"values to interpolate between and a third argument to choose how much to "
"interpolate between them; in essence, it *mixes* the two values together. In "
"other APIs, this function is often called ``lerp``. However, ``lerp`` is "
"typically reserved for mixing two floats together; ``mix`` can take any "
"values whether it be floats or vector types."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first color is blue for the ocean. The second color is a kind of reddish "
"color (because all alien planets need red terrain). And finally, they are "
"mixed together by ``n * 0.5 + 0.5``. ``n`` smoothly varies between ``-1`` "
"and ``1``. So we map it into the ``0-1`` range that ``mix`` expects. Now you "
"can see that the colors change between blue and red."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is a little more blurry than we want. Planets typically have a "
"relatively clear separation between land and sea. In order to do that, we "
"will change the last term to ``smoothstep(-0.1, 0.0, n)``. And thus the "
"whole line becomes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What ``smoothstep`` does is return ``0`` if the third argument is below the "
"first and ``1`` if the third argument is larger than the second and smoothly "
"blends between ``0`` and ``1`` if the third number is between the first and "
"the second. So in this line, ``smoothstep`` returns ``0`` whenever ``n`` is "
"less than ``-0.1`` and it returns ``1`` whenever ``n`` is above ``0``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One more thing to make this a little more planet-y. The land shouldn't be so "
"blobby; let's make the edges a little rougher. A trick that is often used in "
"shaders to make rough looking terrain with noise is to layer levels of noise "
"over one another at various frequencies. We use one layer to make the "
"overall blobby structure of the continents. Then another layer breaks up the "
"edges a bit, and then another, and so on. What we will do is calculate ``n`` "
"with four lines of shader code instead of just one. ``n`` becomes:"

msgid "Making an ocean"
msgstr "Tworzenie zmian"

msgid ""
"One final thing to make this look more like a planet. The ocean and the land "
"reflect light differently. So we want the ocean to shine a little more than "
"the land. We can do this by passing a fourth value into the ``alpha`` "
"channel of our output ``COLOR`` and using it as a Roughness map."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This line returns ``0.3`` for water and ``1.0`` for land. This means that "
"the land is going to be quite rough, while the water will be quite smooth."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And then, in the material, under the \"Metallic\" section, make sure "
"``Metallic`` is set to ``0`` and ``Specular`` is set to ``1``. The reason "
"for this is the water reflects light really well, but isn't metallic. These "
"values are not physically accurate, but they are good enough for this demo."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, under the \"Roughness\" section, set ``Roughness`` to ``1`` and set "
"the roughness texture to a :ref:`Viewport Texture <class_ViewportTexture>` "
"pointing to our planet texture :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`. Finally, "
"set the ``Texture Channel`` to ``Alpha``. This instructs the renderer to use "
"the ``alpha`` channel of our output ``COLOR`` as the ``Roughness`` value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You'll notice that very little changes except that the planet is no longer "
"reflecting the sky. This is happening because, by default, when something is "
"rendered with an alpha value, it gets drawn as a transparent object over the "
"background. And since the default background of the :ref:`Viewport "
"<class_Viewport>` is opaque, the ``alpha`` channel of the :ref:`Viewport "
"Texture <class_ViewportTexture>` is ``1``, resulting in the planet texture "
"being drawn with slightly fainter colors and a ``Roughness`` value of ``1`` "
"everywhere. To correct this, we go into the :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` "
"and enable the \"Transparent Bg\" property. Since we are now rendering one "
"transparent object on top of another, we want to enable "
"``blend_premul_alpha``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This pre-multiplies the colors by the ``alpha`` value and then blends them "
"correctly together. Typically, when blending one transparent color on top of "
"another, even if the background has an ``alpha`` of ``0`` (as it does in "
"this case), you end up with weird color bleed issues. Setting "
"``blend_premul_alpha`` fixes that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now the planet should look like it is reflecting light on the ocean but not "
"the land. If you haven't done so already, add an :ref:`OmniLight3D "
"<class_OmniLight3D>` to the scene so you can move it around and see the "
"effect of the reflections on the ocean."

msgid ""
"And there you have it. A procedural planet generated using a :ref:`Viewport "
