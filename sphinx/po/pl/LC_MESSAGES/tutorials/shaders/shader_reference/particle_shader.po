"Particle shaders are a special type of vertex shader that runs before the "
"object is drawn. They are used for calculating material properties such as "
"color, position, and rotation. They are drawn with any regular material for "
"CanvasItem or Spatial, depending on whether they are 2D or 3D."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Particle shaders are unique because they are not used to draw the object "
"itself; they are used to calculate particle properties, which are then used "
"by the CanvasItem of Spatial shader. They contain only a vertex processor "
"function that outputs multiple properties (see built-ins below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Particle shaders use a transform feedback shader, which is a special type of "
"vertex shader that runs on its own. It takes in data in a buffer like a "
"regular vertex shader does, but it also outputs to data buffers instead of "
"outputting to the fragment shader for pixel-processing. Because of this, "
"transform feedback shaders can build on themselves each run, unlike other "
"shaders that discard the data they have calculated once they draw to the "
"frame buffer."

"Particle shaders are only available in the GLES3 backend. If you need "
"particles in GLES2, use :ref:`CPUParticles <class_CPUParticles>`."
