msgid ""
"Since Godot 3.3, there is a `Web editor <https://editor.godotengine.org/>`__ "
"you can use to work on new or existing projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The web editor is in a preliminary stage. While its feature set may be "
"sufficient for educational purposes, it is currently **not recommended for "
"production work**. See :ref:`doc_using_the_web_editor_limitations` below."

msgid "Browser support"
msgstr "Oficjalne Wsparcie"

msgid ""
"The Web editor requires support for WebAssembly's SharedArrayBuffer. This is "
"in turn required to support threading in the browser. The following desktop "
"browsers support WebAssembly threading and can therefore run the web editor:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Chrome 68 or later"
msgstr ""

msgid "Firefox 79 or later"
msgstr ""

msgid "Edge 79 or later"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Opera and Safari are not supported yet. Safari may work in the future once "
"proper threading support is added."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Mobile browsers are currently not supported.**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The web editor supports both the GLES3 and GLES2 renderers, although GLES2 "
"is recommended for better performance and compatibility with old/low-end "
"hardware."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you use Linux, due to `poor Firefox WebGL performance <https://bugzilla."
"mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1010527>`__, it's recommended to use a Chromium-"
"based browser instead of Firefox."

msgid "Limitations"

msgid ""
"Due to limitations on the Godot or Web platform side, the following features "
"are currently missing:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "No C#/Mono support."
msgstr "|eol| Już nie wspierany."

msgid "No GDNative support."

msgid ""
"No debugging support. This means GDScript debugging/profiling, live scene "
"editing, the Remote Scene tree dock and other features that rely on the "
"debugger protocol will not work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No project exporting. As a workaround, you can download the project source "
"using **Project > Tools > Download Project Source** and export it using a "
"`native version of the Godot editor <https://godotengine.org/download>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid "The editor won't warn you when closing the tab with unsaved changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No lightmap baking support. You can still use existing lightmaps if they "
"were baked with a native version of the Godot editor (e.g. by importing an "
"existing project)."

"The following features are unlikely to be supported due to inherent "
"limitations of the Web platform:"

"Specify a ZIP file to preload on the HTML5 filesystem using the **Preload "
"project ZIP** input."

msgid ""
"Run the editor by clicking **Start Godot editor**. The Godot project manager "
"should appear after 10-20 seconds. On slower machines or connections, "
"loading may take up to a minute."

"It's important to place the project folder somewhere in ``/home/web_user/``. "

msgid "Editing and running a project"
msgstr "Tworzenie nowego projektu"

msgid ""
"Unlike the native version of Godot, the web editor is constrained to a "
"single window. Therefore, it cannot open a new window when running the "
"project. Instead, when you run the project by clicking the Run button or "
"pressing :kbd:`F5`, it will appear to \"replace\" the editor window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The web editor offers an alternative way to deal with the editor and game "
"windows (which are now \"tabs\"). You can switch between the **Editor** and "
"**Game** tabs using the buttons on the top. You can also close the running "
"game or editor by clicking the **×** button next to those tabs."

msgid ""
"Due to browser security limitations, the editor will save the project files "
"to the browser's IndexedDB storage. This storage isn't accessible as a "
"regular folder on your machine, but is abstracted away in a database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can download the project files as a ZIP archive by using **Project > "
"Tools > Download Project Source**. This can be used to export the project "
"using a `native Godot editor <https://godotengine.org/download>`__, since "
"exporting from the web editor isn't supported yet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the future, it may be possible to use the `HTML5 FileSystem API <https://"
"developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystem>`__ to store the project "
"files on the user's filesystem as the native editor would do. However, this "
"isn't implemented yet."
