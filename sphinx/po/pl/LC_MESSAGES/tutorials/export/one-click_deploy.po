msgid ""
"One-click deploy is a feature that is available once a platform is properly "
"configured and a supported device is connected to the computer. Since things "
"can go wrong at many levels (platform may not be configured correctly, SDK "
"may be incorrectly installed, device may be improperly configured, etc.), "
"it's good to let the user know that it exists."

"After adding an Android export preset marked as Runnable, Godot can detect "
"when a USB device is connected to the computer and offer the user to "
"automatically export, install and run the project (in debug mode) on the "
"device. This feature is called *one-click deploy*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One-click deploy is only available once you've added an export template "
"marked as **Runnable** in the Export dialog. You can mark several export "
"presets as runnable, but only one preset per platform may be marked as "
"runnable. If you mark a second preset in a given platform as runnable, the "
"other preset will no longer be marked as runnable."

"**Android:** Exports the project with debugging enabled and runs it on the "
"connected device."

"Make sure to follow the steps described in :ref:`doc_exporting_for_android`. "

"If you have more than one device connected, Godot will ask you which device "
"the project should be exported to."

"**HTML5:** Starts a local web server and runs the exported project by "
"opening the default web browser."

"Check if USB debugging is enabled *and authorized on the device*. Try "
"unlocking your device and accepting the authorization prompt if you see any. "
"If you can't see this prompt, running ``adb devices`` on your PC should make "
