"In order to pack all resources of a project into a PCK file open the project "
"and go to Project/Export and click on \"Export PCK/Zip\". Also make sure to "
"have an export template selected while doing so."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another method would be to :ref:`export from the command line "
"<doc_command_line_tutorial_exporting>`. If the output file ends with a PCK "
"or ZIP file extension, then the export process will build that type of file "
"for the chosen platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If one wishes to support mods for their game, they will need their users to "
"create similarly exported files. Assuming the original game expects a "
"certain structure for the PCK's resources and/or a certain interface for its "
"scripts, then either..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The developer must publicize documentation of these expected structures/ "
"interfaces, expect modders to install Godot Engine, and then also expect "
"those modders to conform to the documentation's defined API when building "
"mod content for the game (so that it will work). Users would then use "
"Godot's built in exporting tools to create a PCK file, as detailed above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The developer uses Godot to build a GUI tool for adding their exact API "
"content to a project. This Godot tool must either run on a tools-enabled "
"build of the engine or have access to one (distributed alongside or perhaps "
"in the original game's files). The tool can then use the Godot executable to "
"export a PCK file from the command line with :ref:`OS.execute() "
"<class_OS_method_execute>`. The game itself shouldn't use a tool-build of "
"the engine (for security), so it's best to keep the modding tool and game "
"separate."

msgid "Opening PCK files at runtime"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To import a PCK file, one uses the ProjectSettings singleton. The following "
"example expects a “mod.pck” file in the directory of the games executable. "
"The PCK file contains a “mod_scene.tscn” test scene in its root."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, if you import a file with the same file path/name as one you "
"already have in your project, the imported one will replace it. This is "
"something to watch out for when creating DLC or mods. You can solve this "
"problem by using a tool that isolates mods to a specific mods subfolder. "
"However, it is also a way of creating patches for one's own game. A PCK file "
"of this kind can fix the content of a previously loaded PCK."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To opt out of this behavior, pass ``false`` as the second argument to :ref:"
"`ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack() "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_load_resource_pack>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a C# project, you need to build the DLL and place it in the project "
"directory first. Then, before loading the resource pack, you need to load "
"its DLL as follows: ``Assembly.LoadFile(\"mod.dll\")``"

msgid ""
"This tutorial explains how to add mods, patches, or DLC to a game. The most "
"important thing is to identify how one plans to distribute future content "
"for their game and develop a workflow that is customized for that purpose. "
"Godot should make that process smooth regardless of which route a developer "
"pursues."
