"This page describes how to export a Godot project to Windows. If you're "
"looking to compile editor or export template binaries from source instead, "
"read :ref:`doc_compiling_for_windows`."

"The simplest way to distribute a game for PC is to copy the executable "
"(``godot.exe``), compress the folder and send it to someone else. However, "
"this is often not desired."

"Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the "
"export system. When exporting for Windows, the exporter takes all the "
"project files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is bundled with a "
"specially optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does not contain the "
"editor and debugger."

"To enable code signing, you must have the ``Windows 10 SDK`` (on Windows) or "
"`osslsigncode <https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode>`__ (on any other "
"OS) installed."

"Download the Godot export templates. Use the Godot menu: ``Editor > Manage "
"Export Templates``."

"If you export for Windows with embedded PCK files, you will not be able to "
"sign the program as it will break."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, PCK embedding is also known to cause false positives in "
"antivirus programs. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using it unless "
"you're distributing your project via Steam as it bypasses code signing and "
"antivirus checks."
