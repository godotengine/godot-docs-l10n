"This tutorial describes an advanced method for post-processing in Godot. In "
"particular, it will explain how to write a post-processing shader that uses "
"the depth buffer. You should already be familiar with post-processing "
"generally and, in particular, with the methods outlined in the :ref:`custom "
"post-processing tutorial <doc_custom_postprocessing>`."

"In the previous post-processing tutorial, we rendered the scene to a :ref:"
"`Viewport <class_Viewport>` and then rendered the Viewport in a :ref:"
"`ViewportContainer <class_ViewportContainer>` to the main scene. One "
"limitation of this method is that we could not access the depth buffer "
"because the depth buffer is only available in spatial shaders and Viewports "
"do not maintain depth information."

"To get around the limitation on using the depth buffer, use a :ref:"
"`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>` with a :ref:`QuadMesh <class_QuadMesh>` "
"primitive. This allows us to use a spatial shader and to access the depth "
"texture of the scene. Next, use a vertex shader to make the quad cover the "
"screen at all times so that the post-processing effect will be applied at "
"all times, including in the editor."

"First, create a new MeshInstance and set its mesh to a QuadMesh. This "
"creates a quad centered at position ``(0, 0, 0)`` with a width and height of "
"``1``. Set the width and height to ``2``. Right now, the quad occupies a "
"position in world space at the origin; however, we want it to move with the "
"camera so that it always covers the entire screen. To do this, we will "
"bypass the coordinate transforms that translate the vertex positions through "
"the difference coordinate spaces and treat the vertices as if they were "
"already in clip space."

"The vertex shader expects coordinates to be output in clip space, which are "
"coordinates ranging from ``-1`` at the left and bottom of the screen to "
"``1`` at the top and right of the screen. This is why the QuadMesh needs to "
"have height and width of ``2``. Godot handles the transform from model to "
"view space to clip space behind the scenes, so we need to nullify the "
"effects of Godot's transformations. We do this by setting the ``POSITION`` "
"built-in to our desired position. ``POSITION`` bypasses the built-in "
"transformations and sets the vertex position directly."

"Even with this vertex shader, the quad keeps disappearing. This is due to "
"frustum culling, which is done on the CPU. Frustum culling uses the camera "
"matrix and the AABBs of Meshes to determine if the Mesh will be visible "
"*before* passing it to the GPU. The CPU has no knowledge of what we are "
"doing with the vertices, so it assumes the coordinates specified refer to "
"world positions, not clip space positions, which results in Godot culling "
"the quad when we turn away from the center of the scene. In order to keep "
"the quad from being culled, there are a few options:"

"The values returned by ``DEPTH_TEXTURE`` are between ``0`` and ``1`` and are "
"nonlinear. When displaying depth directly from the ``DEPTH_TEXTURE``, "
"everything will look almost white unless it is very close. This is because "
"the depth buffer stores objects closer to the camera using more bits than "
"those further, so most of the detail in depth buffer is found close to the "
"camera. In order to make the depth value align with world or model "
"coordinates, we need to linearise the value. When we apply the projection "
"matrix to the vertex position, the z value is made nonlinear, so to "
"linearise it, we multiply it by the inverse of the projection matrix, which "
"in Godot, is accessible with the variable ``INV_PROJECTION_MATRIX``."

"Firstly, take the screen space coordinates and transform them into "
