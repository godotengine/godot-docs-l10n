"Godot provides several ways to customize the imported data, such as the "
"import dock, the advanced import setting dialog, and inherited scenes. This "
"can be used to make further changes to the imported scene, such as adjusting "
"meshes, adding physics information, and adding new nodes. You can also write "
"a script that runs code at the end of the import process to perform "
"arbitrary customization."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that, when applicable, modifying the original data should be preferred "
"to configuring the scene after import. This helps minimize the differences "
"between the 3D modeling application and the imported scene. See the :ref:"

"Since Godot can only save its own scene format (``.tscn``/``.scn``), Godot "

"source file."
