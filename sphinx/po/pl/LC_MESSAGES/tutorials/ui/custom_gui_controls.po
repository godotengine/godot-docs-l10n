msgid "So many controls..."
msgstr "Tak wiele kontrolek..."

msgid ""
"Yet there are never enough. Creating your own custom controls that act just "
"the way you want them to is an obsession of almost every GUI programmer. "
"Godot provides plenty of them, but they may not work exactly the way you "
"want. Before contacting the developers with a pull-request to support "
"diagonal scrollbars, at least it will be good to know how to create these "
"controls easily from script."

msgid "Drawing"
msgstr "Rysowanie"

msgid ""
"For drawing, it is recommended to check the :ref:`doc_custom_drawing_in_2d` "
"tutorial. The same applies. Some functions are worth mentioning due to their "
"usefulness when drawing, so they will be detailed next:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Checking control size"
msgstr "Sprawdzanie wielkości kontrolki"

msgid ""
"Unlike 2D nodes, \"size\" is important with controls, as it helps to "
"organize them in proper layouts. For this, the :ref:`Control.rect_size "
"<class_Control_property_rect_size>` property is provided. Checking it during "
"``_draw()`` is vital to ensure everything is kept in-bounds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Checking focus"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some controls (such as buttons or text editors) might provide input focus "
"for keyboard or joypad input. Examples of this are entering text or pressing "
"a button. This is controlled with the :ref:`Control.focus_mode "
"<class_Control_property_focus_mode>` property. When drawing, and if the "
"control supports input focus, it is always desired to show some sort of "
"indicator (highlight, box, etc.) to indicate that this is the currently "
"focused control. To check for this status, the :ref:`Control.has_focus() "
"<class_Control_method_has_focus>` method exists. Example"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sizing"
msgstr "Rozmiar"

msgid ""
"As mentioned before, size is important to controls. This allows them to lay "
"out properly, when set into grids, containers, or anchored. Controls, most "
"of the time, provide a *minimum size* to help properly lay them out. For "
"example, if controls are placed vertically on top of each other using a :ref:"
"`VBoxContainer <class_VBoxContainer>`, the minimum size will make sure your "
"custom control is not squished by the other controls in the container."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To provide this callback, just override :ref:`Control.get_minimum_size() "
"<class_Control_method_get_minimum_size>`, for example:"

msgstr "Lub alternatywnie, ustaw to za pomocą funkcji:"

msgid "Input"
msgstr "Wejście"

msgid ""
"Controls provide a few helpers to make managing input events much easier "
"than regular nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Input events"
msgstr "Zdarzenia wejścia"

msgid ""
"There are a few tutorials about input before this one, but it's worth "
"mentioning that controls have a special input method that only works when:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The mouse pointer is over the control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The button was pressed over this control (control always captures input "
"until button is released)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Control provides keyboard/joypad focus via :ref:`Control.focus_mode "
"<class_Control_property_focus_mode>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is :ref:`Control._gui_input() "
"<class_Control_method__gui_input>`. Simply override it in your control. No "
"processing needs to be set."

"For more information about events themselves, check the :ref:"
"`doc_inputevent` tutorial."

"Więcej informacji można znaleźć na stronie :ref:`doc_inputevent` tutorial."

msgid "Notifications"
msgstr "Powiadomienia"

msgid ""
"Controls also have many useful notifications for which no dedicated callback "
"exists, but which can be checked with the _notification callback:"
