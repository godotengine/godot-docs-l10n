"Godot provides many post-processing effects out of the box, including Bloom, "

"Post-processing effects are shaders applied to a frame after Godot rendered "
"it. You first want to render your scene into a :ref:`Viewport "
"<class_Viewport>`, then render the ``Viewport`` inside a :ref:"
"`ViewportTexture <class_ViewportTexture>` and show it on the screen."

"The easiest way to implement a custom post-processing shader is to use "
"Godot's built-in ability to read from the screen texture. If you're not "
"familiar with this, you should read the :ref:`Screen Reading Shaders "
"Tutorial <doc_screen-reading_shaders>` first."

"As of the time of writing, Godot does not support rendering to multiple "
"buffers at the same time. Your post-processing shader will not have access "
"to normals or other render passes. You only have access to the rendered "

"The Sobel filter reads pixels in a 9x9 grid around the current pixel and "

"You can use different kernels to create edge detection filters, outlines, "

"Some post-processing effects like blur are resource intensive. If you break "

"To make a multi-pass post-processing shader, you stack ``Viewport`` nodes. "
