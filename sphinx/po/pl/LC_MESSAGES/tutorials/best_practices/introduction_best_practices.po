"This series is a collection of best practices to help you work efficiently "
"with Godot."

msgid ""
"Godot allows for a great amount of flexibility in how you structure a "
"project's codebase and break it down into scenes. Each approach has its pros "
"and cons, and they can be hard to weigh until you've worked with the engine "
"for long enough."

"There are always many ways to structure your code and solve specific "
"programming problems. It would be impossible to cover them all here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is why each article starts from a real-world problem. We will break "
"down each problem in fundamental questions, suggest solutions, analyze the "
"pros and cons of each option, and highlight the best course of action for "
"the problem at hand."

msgid ""
"You should start by reading :ref:`doc_what_are_godot_classes`. It explains "
"how Godot's nodes and scenes relate to classes and objects in other Object-"
"Oriented programming languages. It will help you make sense of the rest of "
"the series."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The best practices in Godot rely on Object-Oriented design principles. We "
"use tools like the `single responsibility <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Single_responsibility_principle>`_ principle and `encapsulation <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)>`_."
