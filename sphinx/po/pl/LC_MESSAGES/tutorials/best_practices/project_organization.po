msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Wprowadzenie"

msgid ""
"Since Godot has no restrictions on project structure or filesystem usage, "
"organizing files when learning the engine can seem challenging. This "
"tutorial suggests a workflow which should be a good starting point. We will "
"also cover using version control with Godot."

msgid "Organization"
msgstr "Organizacja"

msgid ""
"Godot is scene-based in nature, and uses the filesystem as-is, without "
"metadata or an asset database."
msgstr ""
"Godot jest oparty o rozwiązania widoczne w naturze i korzysta z systemu "
"plików bez metadanych i bazy danych zasobów."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Unlike other engines, many resources are contained within the scene itself, "
"so the amount of files in the filesystem is considerably lower."
msgstr ""
"W przeciwieństwie do innych silników, wiele zasobów znajduje się w scenie, "
"więc liczba plików w systemie plików jest znacznie mniejsza."

msgid ""
"Considering that, the most common approach is to group assets as close to "
"scenes as possible; when a project grows, it makes it more maintainable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As an example, one can usually place into a single folder their basic "
"assets, such as sprite images, 3D model meshes, materials, and music, etc. "
"They can then use a separate folder to store built levels that use them."

msgid "Style guide"
msgstr "Styl pisania kodu źródłowego Godota"

msgid ""
"For consistency across projects, we recommend following these guidelines:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use **snake_case** for folder and file names (with the exception of C# "
"scripts). This sidesteps case sensitivity issues that can crop up after "
"exporting a project on Windows. C# scripts are an exception to this rule, as "
"the convention is to name them after the class name which should be in "
"PascalCase."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use **PascalCase** for node names, as this matches built-in node casing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, keep third-party resources in a top-level ``addons/`` folder, "
"even if they aren't editor plugins. This makes it easier to track which "
"files are third-party. There are some exceptions to this rule; for instance, "
"if you use third-party game assets for a character, it makes more sense to "
"include them within the same folder as the character scenes and scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid "Importing"
msgstr "Importowanie"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Godot versions prior to 3.0 did the import process from files outside the "
"project. While this can be useful in large projects, it resulted in an "
"organization hassle for most developers."
msgstr ""
"Wersja Godota poprzedzająca 3.0 poprawiła import plików spoza projektu. "
"Chociaż może to być przydatne w dużych projektach, spowodowało to kłopoty "
"organizacyjne dla większości deweloperów."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Because of this, assets are now transparently imported from within the "
"project folder."
msgstr ""
"Dzięki temu zasoby są teraz importowane z folderu projektu w sposób "
"przejrzysty."

msgid "Ignoring specific folders"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To prevent Godot from importing files contained in a specific folder, create "
"an empty file called ``.gdignore`` in the folder (the leading ``.`` is "
"required). This can be useful to speed up the initial project importing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a file whose name starts with a dot on Windows, you can use a text "
"editor such as Notepad++ or use the following command in a command prompt: "
"``type nul > .gdignore``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the folder is ignored, resources in that folder can't be loaded anymore "
"using the ``load()`` and ``preload()`` methods. Ignoring a folder will also "
"automatically hide it from the FileSystem dock, which can be useful to "
"reduce clutter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the ``.gdignore`` file's contents are ignored, which is why the "
"file should be empty. It does not support patterns like ``.gitignore`` files "
"do."
msgstr ""

msgid "Case sensitivity"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Windows and recent macOS versions use case-insensitive filesystems by "
"default, whereas Linux distributions use a case-sensitive filesystem by "
"default. This can cause issues after exporting a project, since Godot's PCK "
"virtual filesystem is case-sensitive. To avoid this, it's recommended to "
"stick to ``snake_case`` naming for all files in the project (and lowercase "
"characters in general)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can break this rule when style guides say otherwise (such as the C# "
"style guide). Still, be consistent to avoid mistakes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows 10, to further avoid mistakes related to case sensitivity, you "
"can also make the project folder case-sensitive. After enabling the Windows "
"Subsystem for Linux feature, run the following command in a PowerShell "
"window::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you haven't enabled the Windows Subsystem for Linux, you can enter the "
"following line in a PowerShell window *running as Administrator* then reboot "
"when asked::"
