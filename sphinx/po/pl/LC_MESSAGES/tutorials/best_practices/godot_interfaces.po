msgid ""
"For all :ref:`Object <class_Object>`\\s, the most basic way of referencing "
"them is to get a reference to an existing object from another acquired "
"instance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same principle applies for :ref:`Reference <class_Reference>` objects. "
"While users often access :ref:`Node <class_Node>` and :ref:`Resource "
"<class_Resource>` this way, alternative measures are available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of property or method access, one can get Resources by load access."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Note the following:"
msgstr "Dodaj poniższy kod:"

msgid "There are many ways in which a language can load such resources."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When designing how objects will access data, don't forget that one can pass "
"resources around as references as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that loading a resource fetches the cached resource instance "
"maintained by the engine. To get a new object, one must :ref:`duplicate "
"<class_Resource_method_duplicate>` an existing reference or instantiate one "
"from scratch with ``new()``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nodes likewise have an alternative access point: the SceneTree."

"Godot's scripting API is duck-typed. This means that if a script executes an "
"operation, Godot doesn't validate that it supports the operation by "
"**type**. It instead checks that the object **implements** the individual "
"method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` class has a "
"``visible`` property. All properties exposed to the scripting API are in "
"fact a setter and getter pair bound to a name. If one tried to access :ref:"
"`CanvasItem.visible <class_CanvasItem_property_visible>`, then Godot would "
"do the following checks, in order:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the object has a script attached, it will attempt to set the property "
"through the script. This leaves open the opportunity for scripts to override "
"a property defined on a base object by overriding the setter method for the "
"property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the script does not have the property, it performs a HashMap lookup in "
"the ClassDB for the \"visible\" property against the CanvasItem class and "
"all of its inherited types. If found, it will call the bound setter or "
"getter. For more information about HashMaps, see the :ref:`data preferences "
"<doc_data_preferences>` docs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If not found, it does an explicit check to see if the user wants to access "
"the \"script\" or \"meta\" properties."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If not, it checks for a ``_set``/``_get`` implementation (depending on type "
"of access) in the CanvasItem and its inherited types. These methods can "
"execute logic that gives the impression that the Object has a property. This "
"is also the case with the ``_get_property_list`` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that this happens even for non-legal symbol names such as in the case "
"of :ref:`TileSet <class_TileSet>`'s \"1/tile_name\" property. This refers to "
"the name of the tile with ID 1, i.e. :ref:`TileSet.tile_get_name(1) "
"<class_TileSet_method_tile_get_name>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, this duck-typed system can locate a property either in the "
"script, the object's class, or any class that object inherits, but only for "
"things which extend Object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides a variety of options for performing runtime checks on these "
"accesses:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A duck-typed property access. These will property check (as described "
"above). If the operation isn't supported by the object, execution will halt."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A method check. In the case of :ref:`CanvasItem.visible "
"<class_CanvasItem_property_visible>`, one can access the methods, "
"``set_visible`` and ``is_visible`` like any other method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Outsource the access to a :ref:`FuncRef <class_FuncRef>`. These may be "
"useful in cases where one needs the max level of freedom from dependencies. "
"In this case, one relies on an external context to setup the method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These strategies contribute to Godot's flexible design. Between them, users "
"have a breadth of tools to meet their specific needs."
