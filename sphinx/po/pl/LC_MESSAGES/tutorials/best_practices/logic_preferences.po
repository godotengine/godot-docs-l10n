msgid "Loading vs. preloading"
msgstr "Ładowanie scen"

msgid ""
"In GDScript, there exists the global :ref:`preload "
"<class_@GDScript_method_preload>` method. It loads resources as early as "
"possible to front-load the \"loading\" operations and avoid loading "
"resources while in the middle of performance-sensitive code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Its counterpart, the :ref:`load <class_@GDScript_method_load>` method, loads "
"a resource only when it reaches the load statement. That is, it will load a "
"resource in-place which can cause slowdowns when it occurs in the middle of "
"sensitive processes. The ``load`` function is also an alias for :ref:"
"`ResourceLoader.load(path) <class_ResourceLoader_method_load>` which is "
"accessible to *all* scripting languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So, when exactly does preloading occur versus loading, and when should one "
"use either? Let's see an example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Preloading allows the script to handle all the loading the moment one loads "
"the script. Preloading is useful, but there are also times when one doesn't "
"wish for it. To distinguish these situations, there are a few things one can "
"consider:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If one cannot determine when the script might load, then preloading a "
"resource, especially a scene or script, could result in further loads one "
"does not expect. This could lead to unintentional, variable-length load "
"times on top of the original script's load operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If something else could replace the value (like a scene's exported "
"initialization), then preloading the value has no meaning. This point isn't "
"a significant factor if one intends to always create the script on its own."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If one wishes only to 'import' another class resource (script or scene), "
"then using a preloaded constant is often the best course of action. However, "
"in exceptional cases, one may wish not to do this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the 'imported' class is liable to change, then it should be a property "
"instead, initialized either using an ``export`` or a ``load`` (and perhaps "
"not even initialized until later)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the script requires a great many dependencies, and one does not wish to "
"consume so much memory, then one may wish to, load and unload various "
"dependencies at runtime as circumstances change. If one preloads resources "
"into constants, then the only way to unload these resources would be to "
"unload the entire script. If they are instead loaded properties, then one "
"can set them to ``null`` and remove all references to the resource entirely "
"(which, as a :ref:`Reference <class_Reference>`-extending type, will cause "
"the resources to delete themselves from memory)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Large levels: static vs. dynamic"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If one is creating a large level, which circumstances are most appropriate? "
"Should they create the level as one static space? Or should they load the "
"level in pieces and shift the world's content as needed?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Well, the simple answer is , \"when the performance requires it.\" The "
"dilemma associated with the two options is one of the age-old programming "
"choices: does one optimize memory over speed, or vice versa?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The naive answer is to use a static level that loads everything at once. "
"But, depending on the project, this could consume a large amount of memory. "
"Wasting users' RAM leads to programs running slow or outright crashing from "
"everything else the computer tries to do at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No matter what, one should break larger scenes into smaller ones (to aid in "
"reusability of assets). Developers can then design a node that manages the "
"creation/loading and deletion/unloading of resources and nodes in real-time. "
"Games with large and varied environments or procedurally generated elements "
"often implement these strategies to avoid wasting memory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the flip side, coding a dynamic system is more complex, i.e. uses more "
"programmed logic, which results in opportunities for errors and bugs. If one "
"isn't careful, they can develop a system that bloats the technical debt of "
"the application."
msgstr ""

msgid "As such, the best options would be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "To use a static level for smaller games."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If one has the time/resources on a medium/large game, create a library or "
"plugin that can code the management of nodes and resources. If refined over "
"time, so as to improve usability and stability, then it could evolve into a "
"reliable tool across projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Code the dynamic logic for a medium/large game because one has the coding "
"skills, but not the time or resources to refine the code (game's gotta get "
"done). Could potentially refactor later to outsource the code into a plugin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For an example of the various ways one can swap scenes around at runtime, "
"please see the :ref:`\"Change scenes manually\" "
"<doc_change_scenes_manually>` documentation."
