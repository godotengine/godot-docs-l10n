"AudioStream is the base class of all audio emitting objects. "
"AudioStreamPlayer binds onto an AudioStream to emit PCM data into an "
"AudioServer which manages audio drivers."
msgstr ""
"AudioStream jest podstawową klasą obiektów emitujący dźwięk. "
"AudioStreamPlayer wiąże się z AudioStream, aby emitować dane PCM do serwera "
"audio, który zarządza sterownikami audio."

msgid ""
"All audio resources require two audio based classes: AudioStream and "
"AudioStreamPlayback. As a data container, AudioStream contains the resource "
"and exposes itself to GDScript. AudioStream references its own internal "
"custom AudioStreamPlayback which translates AudioStream into PCM data."

msgid ""
"An AudioStream consists of three components: data container, stream name, "
"and an AudioStreamPlayback friend class generator. Audio data can be loaded "
"in a number of ways such as with an internal counter for a tone generator, "
"internal/external buffer, or a file reference."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some AudioStreams need to be stateless such as objects loaded from "
"ResourceLoader. ResourceLoader loads once and references the same object "
"regardless how many times ``load`` is called on a specific resource. "
"Therefore, playback state must be self-contained in AudioStreamPlayback."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create an AudioStreamPlayback"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"AudioStreamPlayer uses ``mix`` callback to obtain PCM data. The callback "
"must match sample rate and fill the buffer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since AudioStreamPlayback is controlled by the audio thread, i/o and dynamic "
"memory allocation are forbidden."
msgstr ""

msgid "Resampling"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's AudioServer currently uses 44100 Hz sample rate. When other sample "
"rates are needed such as 48000, either provide one or use "
"AudioStreamPlaybackResampled. Godot provides cubic interpolation for audio "
"resampling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of overloading ``mix``, AudioStreamPlaybackResampled uses "
"``_mix_internal`` to query AudioFrames and ``get_stream_sampling_rate`` to "
"query current mix rate."
