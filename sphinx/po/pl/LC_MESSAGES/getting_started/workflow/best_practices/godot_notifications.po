"Every Object in Godot implements a :ref:`_notification "
"<class_Object_method__notification>` method. Its purpose is to allow the "
"Object to respond to a variety of engine-level callbacks that may relate to "
"it. For example, if the engine tells a :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` "
"to \"draw\", it will call ``_notification(NOTIFICATION_DRAW)``."

"When instantiating a scene connected to the first executed scene, Godot will "
