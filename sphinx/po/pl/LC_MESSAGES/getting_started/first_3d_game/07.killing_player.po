"We can kill enemies by jumping on them, but the player still can't die. "
"Let's fix this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We want to detect being hit by an enemy differently from squashing them. We "
"want the player to die when they're moving on the floor, but not if they're "
"in the air. We could use vector math to distinguish the two kinds of "
"collisions. Instead, though, we will use an *Area* node, which works well "
"for hitboxes."

msgid ""
"Head back to the *Player* scene and add a new *Area* node. Name it "
"*MobDetector*. Add a *CollisionShape* node as a child of it."

"Here is a trick you can use to make the collisions only happen when the "
"player is on the ground or close to it. You can reduce the cylinder's height "
"and move it up to the top of the character. This way, when the player jumps, "
"the shape will be too high up for the enemies to collide with it."

"You also want the cylinder to be wider than the sphere. This way, the player "
"gets hit before colliding and being pushed on top of the monster's collision "
"box."
msgstr ""

msgid "The wider the cylinder, the more easily the player will get killed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, select the *MobDetector* node again, and in the *Inspector*, turn off "
"its *Monitorable* property. This makes it so other physics nodes cannot "
"detect the area. The complementary *Monitoring* property allows it to detect "
"collisions. Then, remove the *Collision -> Layer* and set the mask to the "
"\"enemies\" layer."

"When areas detect a collision, they emit signals. We're going to connect one "
"to the *Player* node. In the *Node* tab, double-click the ``body_entered`` "
"signal and connect it to the *Player*."

msgid ""
"The *MobDetector* will emit ``body_entered`` when a *KinematicBody* or a "
"*RigidBody* node enters it. As it only masks the \"enemies\" physics layers, "
"it will only detect the *Mob* nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Code-wise, we're going to do two things: emit a signal we'll later use to "
"end the game and destroy the player. We can wrap these operations in a "
"``die()`` function that helps us put a descriptive label on the code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Try the game again by pressing :kbd:`F5`. If everything is set up correctly, "
"the character should die when an enemy runs into it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, note that this depends entirely on the size and position of the "
"*Player* and the *Mob*\\ 's collision shapes. You may need to move them and "
"resize them to achieve a tight game feel."

"We can use the *Player*\\ 's ``hit`` signal to end the game. All we need to "
"do is connect it to the *Main* node and stop the *MobTimer* in reaction."

"Open ``Main.tscn``, select the *Player* node, and in the *Node* dock, "
