"in Godot. You will learn the pros and cons of each option. In the next part, "
"you will write your first script using GDScript."

"For example, take a game where a Camera2D node follows a ship. The Camera2D "
"node follows its parent by default. Imagine you want the camera to shake "
"when the player takes damage. As this feature is not built into Godot, you "

"Godot offers **five gameplay programming languages**: GDScript, C#, "
"VisualScript, and, via its GDNative technology, C and C++. There are more :"
"ref:`community-supported languages "
"<doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, but these are the official "
"ones."

"You can use multiple languages in a single project. For instance, in a team, "
"you could code gameplay logic in GDScript as it's fast to write, let level "
"designers script quests in the graphical language VisualScript, and use C# "
"or C++ to implement complex algorithms and maximize their performance. Or "

msgid ""
"For C#, you will need an external code editor like `VSCode <https://code."
