"In the previous part, we saw that a scene is a collection of nodes organized "
"in a tree structure, with a single node as its root. You can split your "
"project into any number of scenes. This feature helps you break down and "
"organize your game's different components."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create as many scenes as you'd like and save them as files with the "
"``.tscn`` extension, which stands for \"text scene\". The ``Label.tscn`` "
"file from the previous lesson was an example. We call those files \"Packed "
"Scenes\" as they pack information about your scene's content."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here's an example of a ball. It's composed of a :ref:`RigidBody2D "
"<class_RigidBody2D>` node as its root named Ball, which allows the ball to "
"fall and bounce on walls, a :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` node, and a :ref:"
"`CollisionShape2D <class_CollisionShape2D>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you saved a scene, it works as a blueprint: you can reproduce it in "
"other scenes as many times as you'd like. Replicating an object from a "
"template like this is called **instancing**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As we mentioned in the previous part, instanced scenes behave like a node: "
"the editor hides their content by default. When you instance the Ball, you "
"only see the Ball node. Notice also how each duplicate has a unique name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every instance of the Ball scene starts with the same structure and "
"properties as ``Ball.tscn``. However, you can modify each independently, "
"such as changing how they bounce, how heavy they are, or any property "
"exposed by the source scene."

"Let's add a ball as a child of the Main node. In the Scene dock, select the "

"Change the properties of one ball without affecting the others using the "
"Inspector."
msgstr ""

"Change the default properties of every Ball by opening the ``Ball.tscn`` "

"Changing a property on an instance always overrides values from the "

"``2``, and pressing :kbd:`Enter`."

msgid ""
"Play the game by pressing :kbd:`F5` and notice how all balls now bounce a "
"lot more. As the Ball scene is a template for all instances, modifying it "

msgid ""
"If you change a value on the ``PhysicsMaterial`` of one instance, it will "

msgid "Scene instances as a design language"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instances and scenes in Godot offer an excellent design language, setting "
"the engine apart from others out there. We designed Godot around this "
"concept from the ground up."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We recommend dismissing architectural code patterns when making games with "
"Godot, such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Entity-Relationship diagrams. "
"Instead, you can start by imagining the elements players will see in your "
"game and structure your code around them."

"You can come up with a diagram like this for almost any type of game. Each "
"rectangle represents an entity that's visible in the game from the player's "
"perspective. The arrows tell you which scene owns which."
msgstr ""
"Możesz wymyślić taki schemat dla prawie każdego rodzaju gry. Zapisz części "
"gry, które możesz wizualizować, a następnie dodaj strzałki, aby "
"reprezentować własność jednego komponentu przez drugi."

msgid ""
"Once you have a diagram, we recommended creating a scene for each element "
"listed in it to develop your game. You'll use instancing, either by code or "
"directly in the editor, to build your tree of scenes."
msgstr ""
"Gdy masz już taki schemat, zalecanym procesem tworzenia gry jest stworzenie "
"sceny dla każdego z elementów wymienionych na diagramie. Użyjesz "

"Programmers tend to spend a lot of time designing abstract architectures and "
"trying to fit components into it. Designing based on scenes makes "
"development faster and more straightforward, allowing you to focus on the "
"game logic itself. Because most game components map directly to a scene, "
"using a design based on scene instantiation means you need little other "
"architectural code."
msgstr ""
"Podczas tworzenia gier (i oprogramowania w ogóle), wiele czasu poświęca się "
"na projektowanie architektury i dopasowywanie do niej komponentów. "
"Projektowanie w oparciu o sceny zastępuje to podejście i znacznie "
"przyspiesza i ułatwia cały proces, pozwalając skupić się na samej logice "
"gry. Ponieważ większość komponentów gry oddziałuje bezpośrednio na scenę, "
"konstrukcja projektu na bazie instancji sprawia, że potrzeba tylko "
"niewielkiej ilości innego kodu."

"Imagine we started by creating the room. We could make a couple of different "
"room scenes, with unique arrangements of furniture in them. Later, we could "
"make a house scene that uses multiple room instances for the interior. We "
"would create a citadel out of many instanced houses and a large terrain on "
"which we would place the citadel. Each of these would be a scene instancing "
"one or more sub-scenes."

msgid ""
"Later, we could create scenes representing guards and add them to the "
"citadel. They would be indirectly added to the overall game world."
msgstr ""
"Później mogliśmy tworzyć sceny reprezentujące strażników (i innych NPC-ów) i "
"dodawać je do cytadeli. W rezultacie zostałyby one pośrednio dodane do "

"With Godot, it's easy to iterate on your game like this, as all you need to "
"do is create and instantiate more scenes. We designed the editor to be "
"accessible to programmers, designers, and artists alike. A typical team "
"development process can involve 2D or 3D artists, level designers, game "
"designers, and animators, all working with the Godot editor."
msgstr ""
"Z Godotem, łatwo jest tworzyć grę w ten sposób, ponieważ wszystko co musisz "
"zrobić to stworzyć i wyświetlić więcej scen. Ponadto, interfejs użytkownika "
"edytora jest zaprojektowany tak, aby był przyjazny dla programistów, jak i "
"dla innych użytkowników. Typowy proces tworzenia może obejmować artystów 2D "
"lub 3D, projektantów poziomów, projektantów gier i animatorów, którzy "
"współpracują z interfejsem edytora."
