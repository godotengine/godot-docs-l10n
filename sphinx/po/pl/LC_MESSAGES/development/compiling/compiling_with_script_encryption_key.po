"The export dialog gives you the option to encrypt your scripts with a 256-"
"bit AES key when releasing your project. This will make sure your scripts "

"Of course, the key needs to be stored in the binary, but if it's compiled, "

"This will **not** work if you use official, precompiled export templates. It "
