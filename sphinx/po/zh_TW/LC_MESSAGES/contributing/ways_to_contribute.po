msgid "Ways to contribute"
msgstr "參與貢獻的方法"

msgid ""
"Godot Engine is a non-profit, community-driven free and open source project. "
"Almost all (but our lead dev Juan, more on that below) developers are "
"working *pro bono* on their free time, out of personal interest and for the "
"love of creating a libre engine of exceptional quality."
msgstr ""
"Godot Engine 是非盈利、由社群驅動、自由且開放原始碼的專案。幾乎所有 (除了開發"
"負責人 Juan，詳見下方) 開發人員都是利用空閒時間，抱持想製作高品質自由引擎的熱"
"情所 **無償** 開發的。"

msgid ""
"This means that to thrive, Godot needs as many users as possible to get "
"involved by contributing to the engine. There are many ways to contribute to "
"such a big project, making it possible for everybody to bring something "
"positive to the engine, regardless of their skill set:"
msgstr ""
"這表示，若 Godot 想成長茁壯，則需要儘量有多一點的人參與為 Godot 引擎貢獻。有"
"許多方法可以參與這種大小專案的貢獻，因此，無論是有什麼技能的人，幾乎都能為 "
"Godot 帶來正面改進："

msgid ""
"**Be part of the community.** The best way to contribute to Godot and help "
"it become ever better is simply to use the engine and promote it by word-of-"
"mouth, in the credits or splash screen of your games, blog posts, tutorials, "
"videos, demos, gamedev or free software events, support on the Q&A, forums, "
"Contributors Chat, Discord, etc. Participate! Being a user and advocate "
"helps spread the word about our great engine, which has no marketing budget "
"and can therefore only rely on its community to become more mainstream."
msgstr ""
"**成為社群的一部分。** 要參與貢獻 Godot，並讓 Godot 變得更好的最簡單的方法就"
"是親自使用 Godot 並到處宣傳，不論是在遊戲的製作人員名單內、部落格、教學、影"
"片、Demo 版遊戲、遊戲開發或自由軟體活動、支援與 Q&A、IRC、討論區、Discord …"
"等，一起參加就對了！由於 Godot 沒有行銷預算，幾乎都仰賴與社群來讓 Godot 擠進"
"主流市場，因此如果你能成為 Godot 的使用者與支援者將有助於讓 Godot 這個優秀的"
"遊戲引擎更佳流行。"

msgid ""
"**Make games.** It's no secret that, to convince new users and especially "
"the industry at large that Godot is a relevant market player, we need great "
"games made with Godot. We know that the engine has a lot of potential, both "
"for 2D and 3D games, but given its young age we still lack big releases that "
"will draw attention to Godot. So keep working on your awesome projects, each "
"new game increases our credibility on the gamedev market!"
msgstr ""
"**製作遊戲。** 大家都知道，在 Godot 所參與的這整個產業中，要說服新使用者的方"
"法就是使用 Godot 來製作優質的遊戲。我們知道，Godot 不論是在 2D 還是 3D 遊戲上"
"都有龐大的潛能，但由於 Godot 還很新，因此我們還沒有足夠大型的遊戲來吸引大家的"
"注意。因此，請繼續製作優質的遊戲，每製作一個遊戲就能更提升 Godot 在遊戲開發市"
"場上的名聲！"

msgid ""
"**Get involved in the engine's development.** This can be by contributing "
"code via pull requests, testing the development snapshots or directly the "
"git *master* branch, report bugs or suggest enhancements on the issue "
"tracker, improve the official documentation (both the class reference and "
"tutorials) and its translations. The following sections will cover each of "
"those \"direct\" ways of contributing to the engine."
msgstr ""
"**參與引擎的開發。** 可以通過 Pull Request、測試引擎的開發快照或 Git 的 "
"**master** 分支、回報 Bug 或在 Issue Tracker 上提供改進的建議、或是改進官方說"
"明文件 (類別參考文件與教學) 與其翻譯來參與引擎開發。接下來的段落會討論各種"
"「直接」參與貢獻引擎的方法。"

msgid ""
"**Donate.** Godot is a non-profit project, but it can still benefit from "
"user donations for many things. Apart from usual expenses such as hosting "
"costs or promotional material on events, we also use donation money to "
"acquire hardware when necessary (e.g. we used donation money to buy a "
"MacBook Pro to implement Retina/HiDPI support and various other macOS-"
"related features). Most importantly, we also used donation money to hire "
"core developers so they can work full-time on the engine. Even with a low "
"monthly wage, we need a steady donation income to continue doing this, which "
"has been very beneficial to the project so far. So if you want to donate "
"some money to the project, check `our website <https://godotengine.org/"
"donate>`_ for details."
msgstr ""
"**捐款。** Godot 是一個非營利性專案，但通過使用者的捐款，Godot 依然能在許多方"
"面獲益。除了如伺服器託管費用與在活動上用到的宣傳材料等一般性開支外，我們也會"
"在需要的時候使用收到的捐款來購買硬體 (如，我們曾使用捐款買一台 MacBook Pro 來"
"實作 Retina/HiDPI 支援與其他 macOS 相關的功能)。最重要的是，我們也會使用收到"
"的捐款聘請核心開發者來讓他們全職為 Godot 工作。即使月薪低，我們還是需要穩定的"
"捐款收入才能繼續這麼做，而到目前為止專案也此獲得了許多好處。因此，如果你也想"

msgstr "向上游專案貢獻程式碼修改有兩大好處："

msgid ""
"Your own code will be reviewed and improved by other developers, and will be "
"further maintained directly in the upstream project, so you won't have to "
"reapply your own changes every time you move to a newer version. On the "
"other hand it comes with a responsibility, as your changes have to be "
"generic enough to be beneficial to all users, and not just your project; so "
"in some cases it might still be relevant to keep your changes only for your "
"own project, if they are too specific."
msgstr ""
"所撰寫的程式碼會經過其他開發者的審閱與改進，接著會進一步直接在上游專案中被維"
"護，因此接下來每次更新到新版本後就不需要再重新套用這些修改。另一方面，由於這"
"個改動不能只對你自己的專案有利而已，還必須要讓一般的使用者都能從中獲益，因此"
"這也是一種責任。所以，如果這些改動只適用於你的專案的話，則這些情況就應該只將"
"改動保持在自己的專案裡就好了。"

msgstr ""
"另一種參與貢獻 Godot 的好方法就是測試開發版本或是開發分支，並回報問題。回報在"
