msgid "Optimizing a build for size"
msgstr "最佳化建置檔案大小"

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr "理由"

msgid ""
"Sometimes, it is desired to optimize a build for size rather than speed. "
"This means not compiling unused functions from the engine, as well as using "
"specific compiler flags to aid on decreasing build size. Common situations "
"include creating builds for mobile and Web platforms."
msgstr ""
"有時候，我們會優先最佳化建置大小而不是速度。也就是不編譯引擎內沒用到的功能，"
"以及使用特定的編譯旗標來降低建置的大小。常見的情況如為行動平台與 Web 平台。"

msgid ""
"This tutorial aims to give an overview on different methods to create a "
"smaller binary. Before continuing, it is recommended to read the previous "
"tutorials on compiling Godot for each platform."
msgstr ""
"本教學旨在提供各種能縮小二進位檔的方法概覽。繼續之前，建議先閱讀為各個平台編"
"譯 Godot 的教學。"

msgid ""
"The options below are listed from the most important (greatest size savings) "
"to the least important (lowest size savings)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stripping binaries"
msgstr "在二進位檔中移除"

msgid "**Space savings:** Very high"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Difficulty:** Easy"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** Yes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you build Windows (MinGW), Linux or macOS binaries from source, remember "
"to strip debug symbols from binaries by installing the ``strip`` package "
"from your distribution then running:"
msgstr ""

msgid "On Windows, ``strip.exe`` is included in most MinGW toolchain setups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will reduce the size of compiled binaries by a factor between 5× and "
"10×. The downside is that crash backtraces will no longer provide accurate "
"information (which is useful for troubleshooting the cause of a crash). :ref:"
"`C++ profilers <doc_using_cpp_profilers>` will also no longer be able to "
"display function names (this does not affect the built-in GDScript profiler)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above command will not work on Windows binaries compiled with MSVC and "
"platforms such as Android and HTML5. Instead, pass ``debug_symbols=no`` on "
"the SCons command line when compiling."
msgstr ""

msgid "Optimizing for size instead of speed"
msgstr "最佳化大小而非速度"

msgid "**Space savings:** High"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** Yes, but only for HTML5"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot 3.1 onwards allows compiling using size optimizations (instead of "
"speed). To enable this, set the ``optimize`` flag to ``size``:"
msgstr ""
"Godot 3.1 後可進行大小最佳化 (而非速度)。若要啟用大小最佳化，請將 "
"``optimize`` 旗標設為 ``size`` ："

msgid "Some platforms such as WebAssembly already use this mode by default."
msgstr "部分平台，如 WebAssembly，已預設使用此模式。"

msgid "Compiling with link-time optimization"
msgstr "以連結時期最佳化進行編譯"

msgid ""
"Enabling link-time optimization produces more efficient binaries, both in "
"terms of performance and file size. It works by eliminating duplicate "
"template functions and unused code. It can currently be used with the GCC "
"and MSVC compilers:"
msgstr ""
"開啟連結時期最佳化可產生效能與檔案大小都更有效率的二進位檔。連結時期最佳化是"
"通過清理重複的樣板功能與為使用的程式碼來達成的。目前可以在 GCC 與 MSVC 編譯器"
"上使用："

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Linking becomes much slower and more RAM-consuming with this option, so it "
"should be used only for release builds:"
msgstr "連結在開啟該選項時會變得特別慢，因此應該只用於釋出版本。"

msgid ""
"When compiling the ``master`` branch, you need to have at least 8 GB of RAM "
"available for successful linking with LTO enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When compiling the ``3.x`` branch, you need to have at least 6 GB of RAM "
"available for successful linking with LTO enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling 3D"
msgstr "禁用 3D"

msgid "**Space savings:** Moderate"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** No"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For 2D games, having the whole 3D engine available usually makes no sense. "
"Because of this, there is a build flag to disable it:"
msgstr ""
"對於 2D 遊戲來說，包含完整的 3D 引擎通常沒什麼意義。因此，可以使用一個建置旗"
"標來禁用："

msgid ""
"Tools must be disabled in order to use this flag, as the editor is not "
"designed to operate without 3D support. Without it, the binary size can be "
"reduced by about 15%."
msgstr ""
"必須要禁用 Tools 才能使用該旗標，因為編輯器並非設計給不支援 3D 的情景。關閉 "
"3D 支援後，二進位檔的大小約可以減少 15%。"

msgid "Disabling advanced GUI objects"

"Most small games don't require complex GUI controls such as Tree, ItemList, "
"TextEdit or GraphEdit. They can be disabled using a build flag:"
msgstr ""
"大多數小型遊戲都不需要如 Tree, ItemList, TextEdit 或 GraphEdit 等的複雜 GUI "
"控制。可以通過一個建置旗標來禁用："

"modules and see which ones you actually still need for your game (e.g. you "
"might want to keep networking-related modules, regex support, or theora/webm "
"to play videos)."
msgstr ""
"若確定這個設定與你的需求不合時，可以看看模組列表，找找其中是否有你的遊戲需要"
"的功能 (如，與網路相關的模組、正規表示式支援以及用於播放影片的 Theora/WebM)。"

"Alternatively, you can supply a list of disabled modules by creating "
"``custom.py`` at the root of the source, with the contents similar to the "
