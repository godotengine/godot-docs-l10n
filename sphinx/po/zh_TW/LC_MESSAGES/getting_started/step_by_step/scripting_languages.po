"This lesson will give you an overview of the available scripting languages "
"in Godot. You will learn the pros and cons of each option. In the next part, "
"you will write your first script using GDScript."

"**Scripts attach to a node and extend its behavior**. This means that "

"For example, take a game where a Camera2D node follows a ship. The Camera2D "
"node follows its parent by default. Imagine you want it to shake when the "
"player takes damage. As this feature is not built-into Godot, you would "
"attach a script to it and code the camera shake."

"Godot offers **five gameplay programming languages**: GDScript, C#, "
"VisualScript, and C++ and C via its GDNative technology. There are more :ref:"

"but these are the official ones."

"You can use multiple languages in a single project. For instance, in a team, "
"you could code gameplay logic in GDScript as it's fast to write, let level "
"designers script quests in the graphical language VisualScript, and use C# "
"or C++ to implement complex algorithms and maximize their performance. Or "
"you can write everything in GDScript or C#. It's your call."

msgid ""
"If you're a beginner, we recommend to **start with GDScript**. We made this "
"language specifically for Godot and the needs of game developers. It has a "
"lightweight and straightforward syntax and provides the tightest integration "
"with Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For C#, you will need an external code editor like `VSCode <https://code."
"visualstudio.com/>`_ or Visual Studio. While C# support is now mature, you "
"will also find fewer learning resources for it compared to GDScript. That's "
"why we recommend C# mainly to users who already have experience with the "
"language."

"No `garbage collection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"

"`Gradual typing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing>`_. Variables "

"GDScript looks like Python as you structure your code blocks using "

"Years ago, Godot used Python, then Lua. Both languages' integration took a "

"big challenge with Python."

"Developing a dedicated language doesn't take us more work and we can tailor "

"微軟的 C# 是很受遊戲開發者歡迎的語言，所以 Godot 也新增了對 C# 的官方支援。"

"GDScript code itself doesn't execute as fast as compiled C# or C++. However, "

":ref:`Visual Scripting<doc_what_is_visual_script>` is a graph-based visual "

"You can use other languages to create custom blocks that are specific to "
