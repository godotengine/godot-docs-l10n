"In :ref:`doc_key_concepts_overview`, we saw that a Godot game is a tree of "
"scenes and that each scene is a tree of nodes. In this lesson, we explain a "
"bit more about them. You will also create your first scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nodes"
msgstr "節點"

msgid ""
"**Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of your game**. They are like "
"the ingredients in a recipe. There are dozens of kinds that can display an "
"image, play a sound, represent a camera, and much more."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "All nodes have the following attributes:"
msgstr "有下列事項需注意："

#, fuzzy
msgid "A name."
msgstr "操作名稱"

#, fuzzy
msgid "Editable properties."
msgstr "節點有可編輯的屬性。"

#, fuzzy
msgid "They receive callbacks to update every frame."
msgstr "節點能接收用來處理每一幀的回呼。"

#, fuzzy
msgid "You can extend them with new properties and functions."
msgstr "可以擴充節點（讓節點有更多功能）。"

#, fuzzy
msgid "You can add them to another node as a child."
msgstr "可以新增節點到另一個節點，變成另一個節點的子節點。"

msgid ""
"The last attribute is key. **Together, nodes form a tree**, which is a "
"powerful feature to organize projects. Since different nodes have different "
"functions, combining them produces more complex behavior. As we saw before, "
"you can build a playable character the camera follows using a kinematic body "
"node named \"Character\", a sprite node, a camera node, and a collision "
"shape node."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scenes"
msgstr "場景"

msgid ""
"When you organize nodes in a tree, like our character, we call this "
"construct a scene. Once saved, scenes work like new node types in the "
"editor, where you can add them as a child of an existing node. In that case, "
"the instance of the scene appears as a single node with its internals hidden."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scenes allow you to structure your game's code however you want. You can "
"**compose nodes** to create custom and complex node types, like a game "
"character that runs and jumps, a life bar, a chest with which you can "
"interact, and more."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The Godot editor essentially is a **scene editor**. It has plenty of tools "
"for editing 2D and 3D scenes, as well as user interfaces. A Godot project "
"can contain as many of these scenes as you need. The engine only requires "
"one as your application's **main scene**. This is the scene Godot will first "
"load when you or a player runs the game."
msgstr ""
"基本上來說，Godot 編輯器就是一個 **場景編輯器**，有著各種能夠編輯 2D 與 3D 場"
"景以及使用者介面的工具。但編輯器基本上就只是用來編輯場景以及編輯構成場景的節"
"點。"

msgid "On top of acting like nodes, scenes have the following attributes:"
msgstr ""

msgid "They always have one root node, like the \"Character\" in our example."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can save them to your hard drive and load them later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create as many instances of a scene as you'd like. You could have "
"five or ten characters in your game, created from your Character scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating your first scene"
msgstr "創建內容"

msgid ""
"Let's create our first scene with a single node. To do so, you will need to "
"create a new project first. After opening the project, you should see an "
"empty editor."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"In an empty scene, the Scene dock on the left shows several options to add a "
"root node quickly. \"2D Scene\" adds a Node2D node, \"3D Scene\" adds a "
"Spatial node, and \"User Interface\" adds a Control node. These presets are "
"here for convenience; they are not mandatory. \"Other Node\" lets you select "
"any node to be the root node. In an empty scene, \"Other Node\" is "
"equivalent to pressing the \"Add Child Node\" button at the top-left of the "
"Scene dock, which usually adds a new node as a child of the currently "
"selected node."
msgstr ""
"在空白的場景中 (也就是沒有根節點的場景)，場景 Dock 會顯示好幾個選項，用來快速"
"新增根節點到場景中。[2D 場景] 可以新增 Node2D 節點，[3D 場景] 可以新增 "
"Spatial 節點，[使用者介面] 會新增 Control 節點，[自定節點] 可以選擇任何一種節"
"點 (就跟點擊「新增子節點」的效果一樣)。也可以點擊星形的圖示來顯示或關閉我的最"
"愛裡的節點。"

msgid ""
"We're going to add a single Label node to our scene. Its function is to draw "
"text on the screen."

msgid ""
"Press the \"Add Child Node\" button or \"Other Node\" to create a root node."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Create Node dialog opens, showing the long list of available nodes."
msgstr ""
"如此一來會打開新增節點對話框，會顯示一串長長的列表，包含了所有可以建立的節"

msgid ""
"Click on the Label node to select it and click the Create button at the "
"bottom of the window."
msgstr "點擊 TileSet 屬性，會在編輯器視窗的下方開啟「TileSet」面板："

msgid ""
"A lot happens when you add a scene's first node. The scene changes to the 2D "
"workspace because Label is a 2D node type. The Label appears, selected, in "
"the top-left corner of the viewport. The node appears in the Scene dock on "
"the left, and the node's properties appear in the Inspector dock on the "
"right."
