"Originally, Godot did not have any means to export projects. The developers "
"would compile the proper binaries and build the packages for each platform "

"剛開始，Godot 中沒有能匯出專案的方法。開發人員需要編譯為適當的二進位檔，並為"

"When more developers (and even non-programmers) started using it, and when "
"our company started taking more projects at the same time, it became evident "

"當更多開發人員 (甚至非程式設計師) 開始使用 Godot，或是當一間公司開始同時進行"

"Distributing a game project on PC with Godot is rather easy. Drop the Godot "

msgstr ""
"以 Godot 來發佈遊戲專案很簡單。只需要將 Godot 二進位檔放在跟 ``project."

"It sounds simple, but there are probably a few reasons why the developer may "
"not want to do this. The first one is that it may not be desirable to "
"distribute loads of files. Some developers may not like curious users "
"peeking at how the game was made, others may find it inelegant, and so on. "
"Another reason is that the developer might prefer a specially-compiled "
"binary, which is smaller in size, more optimized and does not include tools "
"like the editor and debugger."
msgstr ""
"說起來很容易，但有幾個原因讓開發人員並不想這麼做。第一種原因是，我們可能不想"
"要發佈這麼多的檔案。有些開發者也可能不喜歡好奇使用者們都看遊戲是怎麼做的，其"
"他開發者則覺得這樣發佈很不優雅。第二種原因則是開發人員可能偏好特別編譯的二進"
"位檔。二進位檔的檔案比較小，最佳化比較好，而且也不包含如編輯器或除錯工具等工"

"同樣的情況，搬到行動平台上就稍微糟糕一點了。要在這些平台上發佈專案，則必須為"
"各個平台建置各自的二進位檔，並將遊戲資料一起新增到原生專案中。"

#: ../../docs/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_projects.rst:52

"This can be troublesome because it means that the developer must be "
"familiarized with the SDK of each platform before even being able to export. "
"While learning each SDK is always encouraged, it can be frustrating to be "
"forced to do it at an undesired time."
msgstr ""
"這代表開發人員必須要在專案連匯出都還沒之前就熟悉各平台的 SDK，所以可能會很麻"

"There is also another problem with this approach: different devices prefer "
"some data in different formats to run. The main example of this is texture "
"compression. All PC hardware uses S3TC (BC) compression and that has been "
"standardized for more than a decade, but mobile devices use different "
"formats for texture compression, such as PVRTC (iOS) or ETC (Android)."
msgstr ""
"這種方法還有另一個問題：不同的裝置偏好以不同格式的資料來執行。主要的例子即為"
