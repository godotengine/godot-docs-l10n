msgid "Now that you've gotten your feet wet, let's talk about Godot's design."
msgstr "現在你已經逐漸上手了，讓我們來瞭解一下 Godot 的設計。"

msgid ""
"**Every game engine is different and fits different needs.** Not only do "
"they offer a range of features, but the design of each engine is unique. "
"This leads to different workflows and different ways to form your games' "
"structures. This all stems from their respective design philosophies."
msgstr ""
"**所有的遊戲引擎都是不同的，而且適用於不同的需求。** 不同遊戲引擎不僅提供了不"
"同的功能，他們各自的設計也有所不同。這就造成了工作流程的不同與不同的遊戲架構"
"組織方式。而這都要歸咎於他們各自的設計理念。"

msgid ""
"This page is here to help you understand how Godot works, starting with some "
"of its core pillars. It is not a list of available features, nor is it an "
"engine comparison. To know if any engine can be a good fit for your project, "
"you need to try it out for yourself and understand its design and "
"limitations."
msgstr ""
"這個頁面會幫助你瞭解 Godot 的運作原理，會先一些核心概念開始。這裡不是要介紹 "
"Godot 包含的功能，也不是要比較各個引擎。如果要知道哪一種引擎適合你的專案，需"
"要自己嘗試並瞭解各個引擎的設計與其限制。"

msgid ""
"Please watch `Godot explained in 5 minutes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?"
"v=KjX5llYZ5eQ>`_ if you're looking for an overview of the engine's features."
msgstr ""
"如果你想瞭解的是引擎功能的概覽，請觀看 `Godot explained in 5 minutes "
"<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjX5llYZ5eQ>`_ （英語）。"

msgid "Object-oriented design and composition"
msgstr "物件導向的設計與組合"

msgid ""
"Godot embraces object-oriented design at its core with its flexible scene "
"system and Node hierarchy. It tries to stay away from strict programming "
"patterns to offer an intuitive way to structure your game."
msgstr ""
"Godot 通過靈活的場景系統與節點結構，在核心設計上就貫徹了物件導向設計。Godot "
"避免強制規定程式設計模式來讓你用更直觀的方式組織遊戲。"

msgid ""
"For one, Godot lets you **compose or aggregate** scenes. It's like nested "
"prefabs: you can create a BlinkingLight scene and a BrokenLantern scene that "
"uses the BlinkingLight. Then, create a city filled with BrokenLanterns. "
"Change the BlinkingLight's color, save, and all the BrokenLanterns in the "
"city will update instantly."
msgstr ""
"首先，Godot 讓你可以 **組合或聚合** 場景。這樣的做法就像巢狀架構的 Prefab 一"
"樣：可以建立一個「BlinkingLight」（閃燈）場景與一個使用 BlingkingLight 的"
"「BrokenLantern」（壞掉的路燈）場景。接著，製作一個使用 BrokenLantern 填滿的"
"城市。一旦修改了 BlinkingLight 的色彩，城市裡所有的 BrokenLantern 都會馬上跟"
"著一起變。"

msgid "On top of that, you can **inherit** from any scene."
msgstr "重點是，場景可以 **繼承** 。"

msgid ""
"A Godot scene could be a Weapon, a Character, an Item, a Door, a Level, part "
"of a level… anything you'd like. It works like a class in pure code, except "
"you're free to design it by using the editor, using only the code, or mixing "
"and matching the two."
msgstr ""
"Godot 的場景可以是一個武器、或是一個角色、是一件物品、一扇門、一道關卡、或是"
"一道關卡的一部分……等任何你能想像的東西。在程式碼中場景就以物件的形式存在，但"
"你也可以使用編輯器來設計場景，也可以只用程式碼來設計出場景，或是同時用編輯器"
"與程式碼來設計場景。"

msgid ""
"It's different from prefabs you find in several 3D engines, as you can then "
"inherit from and extend those scenes. You may create a Magician that extends "
"your Character. Modify the Character in the editor and the Magician will "
"update as well. It helps you build your projects so that their structure "
"matches the game's design."
msgstr ""
"但 Godot 的場景與其他各種 3D 引擎的 Prefab 不同，因為在 Godot 中，可以對場景"
"繼承來進行擴充。你可以建立一個繼承自 Character （角色）場景的 Magician（魔術"
"師）場景，並在編輯器中修改 Character，接著 Magician 便會隨之更新。這樣的設計"
"可以幫助你在建立專案時，這些架構都能符合遊戲的設計。"

"Also note that Godot offers many different types of objects called nodes, "
"each with a specific purpose. Nodes are part of a tree and always inherit "
"from their parents up to the Node class. Although the engine does feature "
"some nodes like collision shapes that a parent physics body will use, most "
"nodes work independently from one another."
msgstr ""
"另外，Godot 也提供成各種不同型別的物件，稱為節點。不同的節點都有不同的功能。"
"節點是樹狀結構下的一員，且繼承自其母節點，而繼承樹的最上層則為 Node 類別。雖"
"然 Godot 引擎也提供了如碰撞區域這類的組件，但這類組件屬於特例。"

msgid ""
"In other words, Godot's nodes do not work like components in some other game "
"engines."

"Sprite is a Node2D, a CanvasItem and a Node. It has all the properties and "

msgid "All-inclusive package"
msgstr "一條龍服務的套裝軟體"

msgid ""
"Godot tries to provide its own tools to answer most common needs. It has a "
"dedicated scripting workspace, an animation editor, a tilemap editor, a "
"shader editor, a debugger, a profiler, the ability to hot-reload locally and "
"on remote devices, etc."
msgstr ""
"Godot 竭力自主提供一般情況下會用到的工具。我們有專用的腳本工作區、有動畫編輯"
"器、有圖塊編輯器、有著色器編輯器、有除錯工具、有分析工具、還有可以在本機與遠"
"端裝置上熱重載 (Hot-Reload) 的功能…等。"

"The goal is to offer a full package to create games and a continuous user "
"experience. You can still work with external programs as long as there is an "
"import plugin for it. Or you can create one, like the `Tiled Map Importer "
"<https://github.com/vnen/godot-tiled-importer>`__."
msgstr ""
"我們的目標就是要提供一個製作遊戲的完整套裝軟體，同時還擁有一致的使用者經驗"
"（User Experience，或譯作使用者體驗）。你也可以同時使用外部程式來配合，只要這"

"That is also partly why Godot offers its own programming languages GDScript "
"and VisualScript, along with C#. They're designed for the needs of game "
"developers and game designers, and they're tightly integrated in the engine "
"and the editor."
msgstr ""
"這也是 Godot 除了 C# 以外，有自己的程式語言 GDScript 與視覺腳本 "
"(VisualScript) 一部分的原因。這些語言是源自遊戲開發者與設計師的需求所設計的，"
"而且也與引擎及編輯器高度整合。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"GDScript lets you write code using an indentation-based syntax, yet it "
"detects types and offers a static language's quality of auto-completion. It "
"is also optimized for gameplay code with built-in types like Vectors and "
"Colors."
msgstr ""
"GDScript 讓你可以使用類似 Python 的格式來撰寫簡單的程式碼，但同時也會偵測型"
"別，並提供媲美靜態語言品質的自動補全功能。而且 GDScript 還提供了如 Vector 與 "
"Color 這樣的內建型別來最佳化遊戲執行。"

msgid ""
"Note that with GDNative, you can write high-performance code using compiled "
"languages like C, C++, Rust, or Python (using the Cython compiler) without "
"recompiling the engine."
msgstr ""
"值得注意的是，使用 GDNative 的話，你也可以使用如 C、C++、Rust、與（使用 "
"Cython 編譯器的）Python 這類的編譯語言而毋須重新編譯整個引擎。"

"Note that the 3D workspace doesn't feature as many tools as the 2D "
"workspace. You'll need external programs or add-ons to edit terrains, "
"animate complex characters, and so on. Godot provides a complete API to "
"extend the editor's functionality using game code. See `The Godot editor is "
"a Godot game`_ below."
msgstr ""

"contributors."
msgstr ""
"Godot 所有的程式碼皆使用 **MIT 授權** 開放原始碼。這表示 Godot 所包含的所有技"

msgid ""
"On the other hand, an open codebase means you can **learn from and extend "
"the engine** to your heart's content. You can also debug games easily, as "
"Godot will print errors with a stack trace, even if they come from the "
"engine itself."
msgstr ""
"另一方面，開放原始碼代表你可以根據你的需求 **一邊擴充引擎一邊學習** 。而你也"
"可以更輕鬆地來除錯遊戲，因為 Godot 在印出錯誤提示時，就算錯誤是來自引擎內部也"
"會包含在堆疊回溯中 。"

"That said, although a handful of core developers work on it full-time, the "
