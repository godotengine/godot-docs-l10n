"The game we'll code here is similar to :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game`, with a "

"You can follow this series without having done the 2D one. However, if "

"We will first work on a basic prototype for the player's movement. We will "
"then add the monsters that we'll spawn randomly around the screen. After "
"that, we'll implement the jump and squashing mechanic before refining the "

"我們將首先為玩家的動作製作一個基本的原型。然後添加我們將在螢幕周圍隨機生成的"
