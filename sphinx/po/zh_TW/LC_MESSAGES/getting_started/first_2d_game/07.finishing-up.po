"remaining steps to add a bit more \"juice\" to improve the game experience."

"現在，這個遊戲的所有功能都已經完成了。接下來的這些步驟可以讓遊戲畫龍點睛、增"

"The default gray background is not very appealing, so let's change its "
"color. One way to do this is to use a :ref:`ColorRect <class_ColorRect>` "
"node. Make it the first node under ``Main`` so that it will be drawn behind "
"the other nodes. ``ColorRect`` only has one property: ``Color``. Choose a "
"color you like and select \"Layout\" -> \"Anchors Preset\" -> \"Full Rect\" "
"either in the toolbar at the top of the viewport or in the inspector so that "
"it covers the screen."
msgstr ""
"預設的灰色背景並不是很吸睛，所以來改個顏色。其中一種改背景的方式是新增一個 :"
"ref:`ColorRect <class_ColorRect>` 節點。將 ColorRect 新增為 ``Main`` 底下的第"
"一個節點，這樣 ColorRect 才會被繪製在其他節點的下方。``ColorRect`` 只有一個屬"
"性： ``Color`` （色彩）。選擇一個你喜歡的顏色，並選擇「畫面配置」->「全矩"
"形」，這樣就會覆蓋整個畫面。"

msgid ""
"You could also add a background image, if you have one, by using a "
"``TextureRect`` node instead."
msgstr ""
"如果你有適合的圖片的話，也可以用圖片作為背景。改用 ``TextureRect`` 節點即可。"

msgid "Sound effects"
msgstr "音效"

msgid ""
"Sound and music can be the single most effective way to add appeal to the "
"game experience. In your game assets folder, you have two sound files: "
"\"House In a Forest Loop.ogg\" for background music, and \"gameover.wav\" "
"for when the player loses."
msgstr ""
"聲音與音樂可以是一種最有效能增加遊戲體驗吸引力的方法。遊戲素材資料夾中有兩個"
"聲音檔案：背景音樂用的「House In A Forest Loop.ogg」與玩家 Game Over 時用的"
"「gameover.wav」。"

msgid ""
"Add two :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer <class_AudioStreamPlayer>` nodes as children "
"of ``Main``. Name one of them ``Music`` and the other ``DeathSound``. On "
"each one, click on the ``Stream`` property, select \"Load\", and choose the "
"corresponding audio file."
msgstr ""
"在 ``Main`` 中新增兩個 :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer <class_AudioStreamPlayer>` 節"
"點作為子節點。將其中一個命名為 ``Music`` ，另一個則為 ``DeathSound`` 。在各個"
"節點上點擊 ``Stream`` （串流）屬性，選擇「載入」，並選擇對應的音訊檔。"

msgid ""
"All audio is automatically imported with the ``Loop`` setting disabled. If "
"you want the music to loop seamlessly, click on the Stream file arrow, "
"select ``Make Unique``, then click on the Stream file and check the ``Loop`` "
"box."

msgid ""
"To play the music, add ``$Music.play()`` in the ``new_game()`` function and "
"``$Music.stop()`` in the ``game_over()`` function."
msgstr ""
"要播放音樂，在 ``new_game()`` 函式中新增 ``$Music.play()`` ，並在 "

msgid "Keyboard shortcut"
msgstr "鍵盤快捷鍵"

msgid ""
"Since the game is played with keyboard controls, it would be convenient if "
"we could also start the game by pressing a key on the keyboard. We can do "
"this with the \"Shortcut\" property of the ``Button`` node."
msgstr ""
"由於這個遊戲是用鍵盤控制來玩的，如果能用鍵盤上的按鍵也能開始新遊戲的話會很方"
"便。我們可以使用 ``Button`` 節點的「Shortcut」（快捷鍵）屬性來做到。"

msgid ""
"In a previous lesson, we created four input actions to move the character. "
"We will create a similar input action to map to the start button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select \"Project\" -> \"Project Settings\" and then click on the \"Input "
"Map\" tab. In the same way you created the movement input actions, create a "
"new input action called ``start_game`` and add a key mapping for the :kbd:"
"`Enter` key."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now would be a good time to add controller support if you have one "
"available. Attach or pair your controller and then under each input action "
"that you wish to add controller support for, click on the \"+\" button and "
"press the corresponding button, d-pad, or stick direction that you want to "
"map to the respective input action."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the ``HUD`` scene, select the ``StartButton`` and find its **Shortcut** "
"property in the Inspector. Create a new :ref:`Shortcut <class_Shortcut>` "
"resource by clicking within the box, open the **Events** array and add a new "
"array element to it by clicking on **Array[InputEvent] (size 0)**."

"You got to make a player-controlled character, enemies that spawn randomly "
"around the game board, count the score, implement a game over and replay, "
