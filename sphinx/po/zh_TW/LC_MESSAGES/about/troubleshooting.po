"This is a `known bug <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/23069>`__ "
"on Intel graphics drivers on Windows. Updating to the latest graphics driver "
"version *provided by Intel* should fix the issue."
msgstr ""
"這個問題是 Windows 上 Intel 圖形驅動程式的 `已知 Bug <https://github.com/"

"You should use the graphics driver provided by Intel rather than the one "

"often outdated."
msgstr ""
"請使用由 Intel 提供的顯示卡驅動程式，而不要使用主機或筆電製造商提供的程式，因"

"The only workaround, for now, is to switch to the GLES2 renderer. You can "

"Settings."
msgstr ""
"目前唯一的臨時解決方案，就只有將算繪引擎改成 GLES2。可以從編輯器的右上角切換"

"This is a `known bug <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20566>`__ "
"on Windows when you have specific USB peripherals connected. In particular, "
"Corsair's iCUE software seems to cause the bug. Try updating your USB "
"peripherals' drivers to their latest version. If the bug persists, you need "
"to disconnect the faulty peripherals before opening the editor. You can then "
"connect the peripheral again."
msgstr ""
"這是在 Windows 上的一個 `已知 Bug <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/"
"issues/20566>`__ ，會發生在有連接到特定 USB 週邊設備時。特別是 Corsair 的 "
"iCUE 軟體似乎會導致這個問題。請試著更新這些 USB 週邊設備的驅動程式至最新版"
"本。若仍然遇到此 Bug，則必須在開啟編輯器時先斷開有問題的週邊設備。開啟後即可"

msgid "The Godot editor appears frozen after clicking the system console."
msgstr "點擊系統主控台後，Godot 編輯器沒有回應。"

msgid ""
"When running Godot on Windows with the system console enabled, you can "
"accidentally enable *selection mode* by clicking inside the command window. "
"This Windows-specific behavior pauses the application to let you select text "
"inside the system console. Godot cannot override this system-specific "
"behavior."
msgstr ""
"在 Windows 上啟用系統主控台時執行 Godot，可能會不小心在命令視窗內因點擊而啟用"
"了 **選擇模式** 。這個行為只會發生在 Windows 上，會暫停應用程式來讓使用者可選"

"This is caused by the NVIDIA graphics driver injecting an overlay to display "
"information."

msgid ""
"To disable this overlay on Windows, restore your graphics driver settings to "
"the default values in the NVIDIA Control Panel."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To disable this overlay on Linux, open ``nvidia-settings``, go to **X Screen "
"0 > OpenGL Settings** then uncheck **Enable Graphics API Visual Indicator**."
msgstr ""

msgid "The project window appears blurry, unlike the editor."
msgstr "專案視窗看起來很模式，編輯器則不會。"

msgid ""
"Unlike the editor, the project isn't marked as DPI-aware by default. This is "
"done to improve performance, especially on integrated graphics, where "
"rendering 3D scenes in hiDPI is slow."
msgstr ""
"專案視窗與編輯器不同，預設情況下不會依據 DPI 做調整。這個特性是為了提升效能，"
"特別是內顯在 hiDPI 下算繪 3D 場景時很慢。"

msgid ""
"To resolve this, open **Project > Project Settings** and enable **Display > "
"Window > Dpi > Allow Hidpi**. On top of that, make sure your project is "
"configured to support :ref:`multiple resolutions <doc_multiple_resolutions>`."
msgstr ""
"要解決此問題，請開啟 **[專案] > [專案設定]** 並啟用 **[Display] > [Window] > "

msgid ""
"The project works when run from the editor, but fails to load some files "
"when running from an exported copy."
msgstr "專案可以從編輯器裡執行，但是從匯出的版本執行時無法載入某些檔案。"

msgid ""
"This is usually caused by forgetting to specify a filter for non-resource "
"files in the Export dialog. By default, Godot will only include actual "
"*resources* into the PCK file. Some files commonly used, such as JSON files, "
"are not considered resources. For example, if you load ``test.json`` in the "
"exported project, you need to specify ``*.json`` in the non-resource export "
"filter. See :ref:`doc_exporting_projects_export_mode` for more information."
msgstr ""
"這個問題通常時因為忘記在 [匯出] 對話框中為非資源檔案指定篩選器導致的。預設情"
"況下，Godot 只會將真正的 **資源 (Resource)** 打包進 PCK 檔案內。有些常用的檔"
"案，如 JSON 檔，並不屬於資源。舉例來說，若在匯出的專案中載入 ``test.json`` ，"
"則需要在非資源匯出篩選器內指定 ``*.json`` 。更多資訊請參考 :ref:"
"`doc_exporting_projects_export_mode` 。"

msgid ""
"On Windows, this can also be due to :ref:`case sensitivity "
"<doc_project_organization_case_sensitivity>` issues. If you reference a "
"resource in your script with a different case than on the filesystem, "
"loading will fail once you export the project. This is because the virtual "
"PCK filesystem is case-sensitive, while Windows's filesystem is case-"
"insensitive by default."
msgstr ""
"而在 Windows 上，這個問題還可能是因為 :ref:`大小寫區分 "
"<doc_project_organization_case_sensitivity>` 問題導致的。若在腳本中以與檔案系"
"統不同的大小寫來參照資源，則匯出專案之後就會載入失敗。這是因為虛擬 PCK 檔案系"
"統是有區分大小寫的，而 Windows 的檔案系統則預設不區分大小寫。"
