msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot is created and distributed under the `MIT License <https://opensource."
"org/licenses/MIT>`_. It doesn't have a sole owner either, as every "
"contributor that submits code to the project does it under this same license "
"and keeps ownership of the contribution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The license is the legal requirement for you (or your company) to use and "
"distribute the software (and derivative projects, including games made with "
"it). Your game or project can have a different license, but it still needs "
"to comply with the original one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In your project's credits screen, remember to also list third-party notices "
"for assets you're using, such as textures, models, sounds, music and fonts."

"Free assets in particular often come with licenses that require attribution. "
"Double-check their license before using those assets in a project."

msgid "Requirements"

"In the case of the MIT license, the only requirement is to include the "
"license text somewhere in your game or derivative project."
