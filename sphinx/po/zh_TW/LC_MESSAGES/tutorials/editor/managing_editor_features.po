msgid ""
"In certain situations, it may be desirable to limit what features can be "
"used in the Godot editor. For example, a UI designer on a team who doesn't "
"need to see 3D features, or an educator slowly introducing features to "
"students. Godot has a built in system called \"feature profiles\" to do this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With feature profiles, major features and nodes can be hidden from the "
"editor. This only hides parts of the interface and does not actually remove "
"support for these features, so scenes and scripts relying on those features "
"will still work fine. This also means feature profiles are not an "
"optimization technique. For information on how to optimize Godot see :ref:"
"`doc_optimization`."

"To manage editor features go to **Editor > Manage Editor Features**. This "
"will open the **Manage Editor Feature Profiles** window. By default there "
"will be no profile. Click on **Create Profile** and give it a name. You will "
"then see a list of all the features in the Godot editor."

"The first section allows major editor features to be removed, such as the 3D "
"editor or scripting editor. Below the main features is every class and node "
"in Godot, which can be disabled as well. Click on a node and all of its "
"properties and options will be listed in the **Extra Items** box, these can "
"all be individually disabled."

msgid "Sharing a profile"
msgstr "使用檔案"

msgid ""
"To share profiles between editors click on the **Export** button. Save the "
"custom profile somewhere as a ``.profile`` file. To use this in another "
"editor open that editor's **Manage Editor Feature Profiles** window and "
"click import, then select the ``.profile`` file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This process is potentially cumbersome however if a large amount of "
"computers need custom profiles. As an alternative, you can enable self-"
"contained mode for Godot, which allows putting all editor configuration in "
"the same folder as the editor binary. See :ref:"
"`doc_data_paths_self_contained_mode` for details."
