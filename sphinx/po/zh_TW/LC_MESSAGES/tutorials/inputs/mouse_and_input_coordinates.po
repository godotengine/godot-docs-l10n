msgid ""
"The reason for this small tutorial is to clear up many common mistakes about "
"input coordinates, obtaining mouse position and screen resolution, etc."

msgid "Hardware display coordinates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using hardware coordinates makes sense in the case of writing complex UIs "
"meant to run on PC, such as editors, MMOs, tools, etc. However, it does not "
"make as much sense outside of that scope."

msgid "Viewport display coordinates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot uses viewports to display content, and viewports can be scaled by "
"several options (see :ref:`doc_multiple_resolutions` tutorial). Use, then, "
"the functions in nodes to obtain the mouse coordinates and viewport size, "
"for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, it's possible to ask the viewport for the mouse position:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the mouse mode is set to ``Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED``, the ``event."
"position`` value from ``InputEventMouseMotion`` is the center of the screen. "
"Use ``event.relative`` instead of ``event.position`` and ``event.speed`` to "
"process mouse movement and position changes."
