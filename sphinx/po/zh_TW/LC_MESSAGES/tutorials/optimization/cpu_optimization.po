"Another handy technique, especially once you have identified the bottleneck "

msgid ""
"When manually timing functions, it is usually a good idea to run the "
"function many times (1,000 or more times), instead of just once (unless it "
"is a very slow function). The reason for doing this is that timers often "
"have limited accuracy. Moreover, CPUs will schedule processes in a haphazard "
"manner. Therefore, an average over a series of runs is more accurate than a "
"single measurement."

"CPU caches are something else to be particularly aware of, especially when "
"comparing timing results of two different versions of a function. The "
"results can be highly dependent on whether the data is in the CPU cache or "
"not. CPUs don't load data directly from the system RAM, even though it's "
"huge in comparison to the CPU cache (several gigabytes instead of a few "
"megabytes). This is because system RAM is very slow to access. Instead, CPUs "
"load data from a smaller, faster bank of memory called cache. Loading data "
"from cache is very fast, but every time you try and load a memory address "
"that is not stored in cache, the cache must make a trip to main memory and "
"slowly load in some data. This delay can result in the CPU sitting around "
"idle for a long time, and is referred to as a \"cache miss\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/optimization/cpu_optimization.rst:141

"This means that the first time you run a function, it may run slowly because "
"the data is not in the CPU cache. The second and later times, it may run "
"much faster because the data is in the cache. Due to this, always use "
"averages when timing, and be aware of the effects of cache."

"Understanding caching is also crucial to CPU optimization. If you have an "
"algorithm (routine) that loads small bits of data from randomly spread out "
"areas of main memory, this can result in a lot of cache misses, a lot of the "
"time, the CPU will be waiting around for data instead of doing any work. "
"Instead, if you can make your data accesses localised, or even better, "
"access memory in a linear fashion (like a continuous list), then the cache "
"will work optimally and the CPU will be able to work as fast as possible."
