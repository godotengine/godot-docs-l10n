msgid ""
"The first part of using them involves exporting and delivering the project "
"to players. Then, when one wants to add functionality or content later on, "
"they just deliver the updates via PCK files to the users."
msgstr ""
"首先，我們需要將專案匯出並行行給玩家。接著，當之後像新增功能或內容時，就可以"
"通過 PCK 檔來提供更新。"

msgid "Generating PCK files"
msgstr "產生 PCK 檔"

msgid ""
"In order to pack all resources of a project into a PCK file open the project "
"and go to Project/Export and click on \"Export PCK/Zip\". Also make sure to "
"have an export template selected while doing so."
msgstr ""
"要將專案中所有的資源都打包到 PCK 檔中，請打開專案，並前往 [專案] -> [匯出]，"
"接著點選 [匯出 PCK/Zip]。匯出時也請確保有選擇匯出樣板。"

msgid ""
"Another method would be to :ref:`export from the command line "
"<doc_command_line_tutorial_exporting>`. If the output file ends with a PCK "
"or ZIP file extension, then the export process will build that type of file "
"for the chosen platform."
msgstr ""
"另一種方法為 :ref:`在命令行中匯出 <doc_command_line_tutorial_exporting>` 。若"
"輸出檔案以 PCK 或 ZIP 副檔名結尾，則匯出過程會為所選平台建置該型別的檔案。"

msgid ""
"If one wishes to support mods for their game, they will need their users to "
"create similarly exported files. Assuming the original game expects a "
"certain structure for the PCK's resources and/or a certain interface for its "
"scripts, then either..."
msgstr ""
"如欲於遊戲中支援 Mod，則必須讓使用者能建立類似的匯出檔案。假設原始遊戲需要特"
"定結構的 PCK 資源，或是需要腳本有特定的介面，那麼可選擇下列其中一種方法..."

msgid ""
"The developer must publicize documentation of these expected structures/ "
"interfaces, expect modders to install Godot Engine, and then also expect "
"those modders to conform to the documentation's defined API when building "
"mod content for the game (so that it will work). Users would then use "
"Godot's built in exporting tools to create a PCK file, as detailed above."
msgstr ""
"開發人員必須公開所需架構／介面的文件，並讓 Mod 作者安裝 Godot Engine，接著要"
"求 Mod 作者依照文件中定義的 API 來製作 Mod (這樣才能正常運作)。使用者接著便能"
"以上述方法通過 Godot 內建匯出工具來製作 PCK 檔案。"

msgid ""
"The developer uses Godot to build a GUI tool for adding their exact API "
"content to a project. This Godot tool must either run on a tools-enabled "
"build of the engine or have access to one (distributed alongside or perhaps "
"in the original game's files). The tool can then use the Godot executable to "
"export a PCK file from the command line with :ref:`OS.execute() "
"<class_OS_method_execute>`. The game itself shouldn't use a tool-build of "
"the engine (for security), so it's best to keep the modding tool and game "
"separate."
msgstr ""
"開發人員使用 Godot 來製作使用專案 API 的 GUI 工具。該 Godot 工具必須執行於有"
"啟用工具功能的引擎建置，或是能存取工具功能的引擎建置 (與原始遊戲檔案一起發"
"佈，或在遊戲檔案內發行)。該工具接著可使用 Godot 的執行檔來在命令行中以 :ref:"
"`OS.execute() <class_OS_method_execute>` 來匯出 PCK 檔。對大多數遊戲來說，都"
"不適合在遊戲中使用工具建置 (安全性考量)，而 Mod 工具則 **要** 啟用工具建置。"

msgid "Opening PCK files at runtime"
msgstr "在執行時開啟 PCK 檔"

msgid ""
"To import a PCK file, one uses the ProjectSettings singleton. The following "
"example expects a “mod.pck” file in the directory of the games executable. "
"The PCK file contains a “mod_scene.tscn” test scene in its root."
msgstr ""
"匯入 PCK 檔只需要一行程式碼。但請記得，當匯入失敗的時候不會產生錯誤或異常，所"
"以開發人員可能需要再多加一層驗證程式碼。下列範例會假設遊戲執行檔資料夾中有"
"「mod.pck」檔案。該 PCK 檔的根目錄中包含一個「mod_scene.tscn」測試場景。"

msgid ""
"By default, if you import a file with the same file path/name as one you "
"already have in your project, the imported one will replace it. This is "
"something to watch out for when creating DLC or mods. You can solve this "
"problem by using a tool that isolates mods to a specific mods subfolder. "
"However, it is also a way of creating patches for one's own game. A PCK file "
"of this kind can fix the content of a previously loaded PCK."
msgstr ""
"預設情況下，若匯入的檔案名稱或路徑已存在於專案中，則專案中的檔案會被匯入的檔"
"案給取代。這一點是製作 DLC 或 Mod 時需要注意的 (可以輕鬆通過工具隔離 Mod 指"
"定 Mod 子資料夾來解決此問題)。但，這也是用來為遊戲製作修正檔的一種手段。這種 "
"PCK 檔可以修正現在載入的 PCK 檔中的內容。"

msgid ""
"To opt out of this behavior, pass ``false`` as the second argument to :ref:"
"`ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack() "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_load_resource_pack>`."
msgstr ""
"若要取消此一行為，請向 :ref:`ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack() "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_load_resource_pack>` 傳入第二個參數為 "
"``false`` 。"

msgid ""
"For a C# project, you need to build the DLL and place it in the project "
"directory first. Then, before loading the resource pack, you need to load "
"its DLL as follows: ``Assembly.LoadFile(\"mod.dll\")``"
msgstr ""
"C# 專案，則需要先建置 DLL 並放在專案資料夾中。接著，在載入資源包前必須先這樣"
"載入 DLL： ``Assembly.LoadFile(\"mod.dll\")``"

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "總結"

msgid ""
"This tutorial explains how to add mods, patches, or DLC to a game. The most "
"important thing is to identify how one plans to distribute future content "
"for their game and develop a workflow that is customized for that purpose. "
"Godot should make that process smooth regardless of which route a developer "
"pursues."
msgstr ""
"本教學說明了如何簡單地給遊戲加上 Mode、修正檔與 DLC。最重要的是該如何計劃發行"
"遊戲未來的內容，以及為此開發一個自定工作流程。Godot 依據開發人員選擇的方法，"
"確保該流程順暢。"
