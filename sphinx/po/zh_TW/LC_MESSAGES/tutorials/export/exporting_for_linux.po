"The simplest way to distribute a game for PC is to copy the executable "
"(``godot``), compress the folder and send it to someone else. However, this "
"is often not desired."

"Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the "
"export system. When exporting for Linux, the exporter takes all the project "
"files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is bundled with a specially "
"optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does not contain the editor and "
"debugger."

"通過匯出系統，Godot 提供一種更優雅的方法來在 PC 平台上發佈。為 PC 平台匯出時 "
"(Linux, Windows, macOS)，匯出工具會以所有的專案檔案建立成一個 ``data.pck`` 檔"
"案。該檔案會內涵一個特別最佳化過的二進位，這個二進位檔更小、更快，而且不包含"
"編輯器與除錯工具。"
