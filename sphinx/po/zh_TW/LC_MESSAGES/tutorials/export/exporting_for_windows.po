"The simplest way to distribute a game for PC is to copy the executable "
"(``godot.exe``), compress the folder and send it to someone else. However, "
"this is often not desired."
msgstr ""
"要為 PC 發佈遊戲最簡單的方法就是複製可執行檔 (Windows 上為 ``godot.exe`` ，其"
"餘為 ``godot``)，壓縮資料夾並將壓縮檔傳送給其他人。但我們通常不想這麼做。"

"Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the "
"export system. When exporting for Windows, the exporter takes all the "
"project files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is bundled with a "
"specially optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does not contain the "
"editor and debugger."
msgstr ""
"通過匯出系統，Godot 提供一種更優雅的方法來在 PC 平台上發佈。為 PC 平台匯出時 "
"(Linux, Windows, macOS)，匯出工具會以所有的專案檔案建立成一個 ``data.pck`` 檔"
"案。該檔案會內涵一個特別最佳化過的二進位，這個二進位檔更小、更快，而且不包含"
"編輯器與除錯工具。"

"To enable code signing, you must have the ``Windows 10 SDK`` (on Windows) or "

"If you export for Windows with embedded PCK files, you will not be able to "
"sign the program as it will break."
msgstr "若為 Windows 匯出內嵌 PCK 檔案，則會沒辦法簽署程式，程式會退出。"

"On Windows, PCK embedding is also known to cause false positives in "
"antivirus programs. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using it unless "
"you're distributing your project via Steam as it bypasses code signing and "
"antivirus checks."
