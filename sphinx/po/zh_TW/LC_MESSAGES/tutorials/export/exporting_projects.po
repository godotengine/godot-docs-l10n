msgid "Exporting projects"
msgstr "匯出專案"

msgid "Why export?"
msgstr "為何要匯出？"

msgid ""
"Originally, Godot did not have any means to export projects. The developers "
"would compile the proper binaries and build the packages for each platform "
"manually."
msgstr ""
"剛開始，Godot 中沒有能匯出專案的方法。開發人員需要編譯為適當的二進位檔，並為"
"各個平台手動建立套件。"

msgid ""
"When more developers (and even non-programmers) started using it, and when "
"our company started taking more projects at the same time, it became evident "
"that this was a bottleneck."
msgstr ""
"當更多開發人員 (甚至非程式設計師) 開始使用 Godot，或是當一間公司開始同時進行"
"更多專案時，很明顯這就成了一個瓶頸。"

msgid "On PC"
msgstr "在 PC 平台上"

msgid ""
"Distributing a game project on PC with Godot is rather easy. Drop the Godot "
"binary in the same directory as the ``project.godot`` file, then compress "
"the project directory and you are done."
msgstr ""
"以 Godot 來發佈遊戲專案很簡單。只需要將 Godot 二進位檔放在跟 ``project."
"godot`` 同一個資料夾內，然後壓縮專案資料夾就好了。"

msgid ""
"It sounds simple, but there are probably a few reasons why the developer may "
"not want to do this. The first one is that it may not be desirable to "
"distribute loads of files. Some developers may not like curious users "
"peeking at how the game was made, others may find it inelegant, and so on. "
"Another reason is that the developer might prefer a specially-compiled "
"binary, which is smaller in size, more optimized and does not include tools "
"like the editor and debugger."
msgstr ""
"說起來很容易，但有幾個原因讓開發人員並不想這麼做。第一種原因是，我們可能不想"
"要發佈這麼多的檔案。有些開發者也可能不喜歡好奇使用者們都看遊戲是怎麼做的，其"
"他開發者則覺得這樣發佈很不優雅。第二種原因則是開發人員可能偏好特別編譯的二進"
"位檔。二進位檔的檔案比較小，最佳化比較好，而且也不包含如編輯器或除錯工具等工"
"具。"

"Finally, Godot has a simple but efficient system for :ref:`creating DLCs as "
"extra package files <doc_exporting_pcks>`."
msgstr ""
"最後，Godot 中有一個簡單卻有效率的系統，可以有用來建立作為額外檔案的 DLC。"

msgid "On mobile"
msgstr "在行動平台上"

msgid ""
"The same scenario on mobile platforms is a little worse. To distribute a "
"project on those devices, a binary for each of those platforms is built, "
"then added to a native project together with the game data."
msgstr ""
"同樣的情況，搬到行動平台上就稍微糟糕一點了。要在這些平台上發佈專案，則必須為"
"各個平台建置各自的二進位檔，並將遊戲資料一起新增到原生專案中。"

msgid ""
"This can be troublesome because it means that the developer must be "
"familiarized with the SDK of each platform before even being able to export. "
"While learning each SDK is always encouraged, it can be frustrating to be "
"forced to do it at an undesired time."
msgstr ""
"這代表開發人員必須要在專案連匯出都還沒之前就熟悉各平台的 SDK，所以可能會很麻"
"煩。雖然我們鼓勵大家學習各 SDK，但還沒準備好就強迫學習總是很讓人沮喪。"

msgid ""
"There is also another problem with this approach: different devices prefer "
"some data in different formats to run. The main example of this is texture "
"compression. All PC hardware uses S3TC (BC) compression and that has been "
"standardized for more than a decade, but mobile devices use different "
"formats for texture compression, such as PVRTC (iOS) or ETC (Android)."
msgstr ""
"這種方法還有另一個問題：不同的裝置偏好以不同格式的資料來執行。主要的例子即為"
"紋理壓縮。所有的 PC 硬體都使用 S3TC (BC) 壓縮，而且早在十年前就標準化了。但行"
"動裝置卻使用不同的紋理壓縮格式，如 PVRTC (iOS) 或 ETC (Android)。"

msgid "Export menu"
msgstr "匯出選單"

msgid ""
"After many attempts at different export workflows, the current one has "
"proven to work the best. At the time of this writing, not all platforms are "
"supported yet, but the supported platforms continue to grow."
msgstr ""
"在試過各種不同的匯出工作流程之後，證明了目前的工作流程效果最佳。在本文章撰寫"
"時，Godot 匯出還未支援所有平台，但支援的平台越來越多。"

msgid "To open the export menu, click the **Export** button:"
msgstr "要打開匯出選單，請點擊 **[匯出]** 按鈕："

msgid ""
"The export menu will open. However, it will be completely empty. This is "
"because we need to add an export preset."
msgstr ""
"接著會打開匯出選單。但，這裡完全是空的。這是因為我們還沒新增任何的匯出預設設"
"定。"

msgid ""
"To create an export preset, click the **Add…** button at the top of the "
"export menu. This will open a drop-down list of platforms to choose from for "
"an export preset."
msgstr ""
"要建立匯出預設設定，請點擊匯出選單上方的 **[新增...]** 按鈕。接著會打開一個列"
"出各個平台的下拉選單，可以用來選擇要製作匯出預設設定的平台。"

msgid ""
"The default options are often enough to export, so tweaking them is usually "
"not necessary. However, many platforms require additional tools (SDKs) to be "
"installed to be able to export. Additionally, Godot needs export templates "
"installed to create packages. The export menu will complain when something "
"is missing and will not allow the user to export for that platform until "
"they resolve it:"
msgstr ""
"預設的設定通常足夠用來匯出了，所以通常不需要更改選項。但，有很多平台都需要安"
"裝額外的工具 (SDK) 才能匯出。另外，Godot 還需要安裝匯出樣板才能建立套件。當要"
"匯出的平台缺少某些東西時，匯出選單會顯示提示，必須解決後才能進行匯出："

msgid ""
"At that time, the user is expected to come back to the documentation and "
"follow instructions on how to properly set up that platform."
msgstr "此時，使用者則需要回來閱讀文件，並依照指示來正確為該平台設定。"

msgid "Export templates"
msgstr "匯出樣板"

msgid ""
"Apart from setting up the platform, the export templates must be installed "
"to be able to export projects. They can be obtained as a TPZ file (which is "
"a renamed ZIP archive) from the `download page of the website <https://www."
"godotengine.org/download>`_."
msgstr ""
"除了設定平台外，還必須要安裝匯出樣板才可以匯出專案。匯出樣板可以從 `Godot 網"
"站的下載頁面 <https://www.godotengine.org/download>`_ 中下載 TPZ 格式的檔案 "
"(即為重命名的 ZIP 壓縮檔)。"

msgid ""
"Once downloaded, they can be installed using the **Install Export "
"Templates** option in the editor:"
msgstr "下載後，便可以通過編輯器中的 **[安裝匯出樣板]** 選項來安裝："

msgid "Resource options"
msgstr "資源路徑"

msgid ""
"When exporting, Godot makes a list of all the files to export and then "
"creates the package. There are 3 different modes for exporting:"
msgstr "匯出時，Godot 會先列出所有要匯出的檔案，接著建立套件。有三種匯出模式："

msgid "Export all resources in the project"
msgstr "匯出專案內所有資源"

msgid "Export selected scenes (and dependencies)"
msgstr "匯出所選場景（與其所有相依性）"

msgid "Export selected resources (and dependencies)"
msgstr "匯出所選資源（與其所有相依性）"

msgid ""
"**Export all resources in the project** will export every resource in the "
"project. **Export selected scenes** and **Export selected resources** gives "
"you a list of the scenes or resources in the project, and you have to select "
"every scene or resource you want to export."
msgstr ""
"**匯出專案內所有資源** 會將專案內所有的資源都匯出。 **匯出所選場景** 與 **匯"
"出所選資源** 則會列出專案中的場景或資源，接著則必須選擇所有欲匯出的場景或資"
"源。"

msgid ""
"Files and folders whose name begin with a period will never be included in "
"the exported project. This is done to prevent version control folders like "
"``.git`` from being included in the exported PCK file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Below the list of resources are two filters that can be setup. The first "
"allows non resource files such as ``.txt``,``.json`` and ``.csv`` to be "
"exported with the project. The second filter can be used to exclude every "
"file of a certain type without manually deselecting every one. For example, "
"``.png`` files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exporting from the command line"
msgstr "從命令行進行匯出"

msgid ""
"In production, it is useful to automate builds, and Godot supports this with "
"the ``--export`` and ``--export-debug`` command line parameters. Exporting "
"from the command line still requires an export preset to define the export "
"parameters. A basic invocation of the command would be:"
msgstr ""
"在正式環境中，適用於自動建置，在 Godot 中可以使用 ``--export`` 與 ``--export-"
"debug`` 參數來從命令行進行匯出。但從命令行匯出依然需要匯出預設設定來指定匯出"
"參數。該指令的基本呼叫方法如下："

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"This will export to ``some_name.exe``, assuming there is a preset called "
"\"Windows Desktop\" and the template can be found. (The export preset name "
"must be written within quotes if it contains spaces or special characters.) "
"The output path is *relative to the project path* or *absolute*; **it does "
"not respect the directory the command was invoked from**."
msgstr ""
"假設有一個名為「Windows Desktop」的匯出預設設定，且可找到匯出樣板，則上述指令"
"會匯出為 ``some_name.exe`` 。匯出路徑為相對於專案的路徑，或是可使用絕對路徑。"
"匯出路徑與執行指令的路徑無關。"

msgid ""
"The output file extension should match the one used by the Godot export "
"process:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Windows: ``.exe``"
msgstr "Windows 範例："

msgid ""
"macOS: ``.zip`` (from all platforms) or ``.dmg`` (only when exporting *from* "
"macOS). ``.app`` is not supported directly, although the generated ZIP "
"archive contains an ``.app`` bundle."

msgid ""
"You can also configure it to export *only* the PCK or ZIP file, allowing a "
"single exported main pack file to be used with multiple Godot executables. "
"When doing so, the export preset name must still be specified on the command "
"line:"
msgstr ""
"也可以設定為只匯出 PCK 或 ZIP 檔，並讓單一匯出可以由多個 Godot 可執行檔使用。"
"可以通過將匯出目標名稱以 ``.pck`` 或 ``.zip`` 結尾來進行。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"It is often useful to combine the ``--export`` flag with the ``--path`` "
"flag, so that you do not need to ``cd`` to the project folder before running "
"the command:"
msgstr ""
"``--export`` 旗標也常常適合與 ``--path`` 一起使用，我們也常常會為自動匯出建立"

msgstr "PCK v.s. ZIP 打包檔案格式"

msgid ""
"Each format has its upsides and downsides. PCK is the default and "
"recommended format for most use cases, but you may want to use a ZIP archive "
"instead depending on your needs."
