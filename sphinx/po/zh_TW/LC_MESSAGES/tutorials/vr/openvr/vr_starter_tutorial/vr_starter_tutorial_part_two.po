msgid "Adding destroyable targets"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before we make any of the special :ref:`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>`-based "
"nodes, we need something for them to do. Let's make a simple sphere target "
"that will break into a bunch of pieces when destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open up ``Sphere_Target.tscn``, which is in the ``Scenes`` folder. The scene "
"is fairly simple, with just a :ref:`StaticBody <class_StaticBody>` with a "
"sphere shaped :ref:`CollisionShape <class_CollisionShape>`, a :ref:"
"`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>` node displaying a sphere mesh, and an :"
"ref:`AudioStreamPlayer3D <class_AudioStreamPlayer3D>` node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The special :ref:`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` nodes will handle damaging "
"the sphere, which is why we are using a :ref:`StaticBody <class_StaticBody>` "
"node instead of something like an :ref:`Area <class_Area>` or :ref:"
"`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` node. Outside of that, there isn't really a "
"lot to talk about, so let's move straight into writing the code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select the ``Sphere_Target_Root`` node and make a new script called "
"``Sphere_Target.gd``. Add the following code:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's go over how this script works."
msgstr ""

msgid "Explaining the Sphere Target code"
msgstr ""

msgid "First, let's go through all the class variables in the script:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``destroyed``: A variable to track whether the sphere target has been "
"destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``destroyed_timer``: A variable to track how long the sphere target has been "
"destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``DESTROY_WAIT_TIME``: A constant to define the length of time the target "
"can be destroyed for before it frees/deletes itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``health``: A variable to store the amount of health the sphere target has."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``RIGID_BODY_TARGET``: A constant to hold the scene of the destroyed sphere "
"target."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Feel free to check out the ``RIGID_BODY_TARGET`` scene. It is just a bunch "
"of :ref:`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` nodes and a broken sphere model."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We'll be instancing this scene so when the target is destroyed, it looks "
"like it broke into a bunch of pieces."
msgstr ""

msgid "``_ready`` function step-by-step explanation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All the ``_ready`` function does is that it stops the ``_physics_process`` "
"from being called by calling ``set_physics_process`` and passing ``false``. "
"The reason we do this is because all the code in ``_physics_process`` is for "
"destroying this node when enough time has passed, which we only want to do "
"when the target has been destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid "``_physics_process`` function step-by-step explanation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First this function adds time, ``delta``, to the ``destroyed_timer`` "
"variable. It then checks to see if ``destroyed_timer`` is greater than or "
"equal to ``DESTROY_WAIT_TIME``. If ``destroyed_timer`` is greater than or "
"equal to ``DESTROY_WAIT_TIME``, then the sphere target frees/deletes itself "
"by calling the ``queue_free`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid "``damage`` function step-by-step explanation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``damage`` function will be called by the special :ref:`RigidBody "
"<class_RigidBody>` nodes, which will pass the amount of damage done to the "
"target, which is a function argument variable called ``damage``. The "
"``damage`` variable will hold the amount of damage the special :ref:"
"`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` node did to the sphere target."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First this function checks to make sure the target is not already destroyed "
"by checking if the ``destroyed`` variable is equal to ``true``. If "
"``destroyed`` is equal to ``true``, then the function calls ``return`` so "
"none of the other code is called. This is just a safety check so that if two "
"things damage the target at exactly the same time, the target cannot be "
"destroyed twice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next the function removes the amount of damage taken, ``damage``, from the "
"target's health, ``health``. If then checks to see if ``health`` is equal to "
"zero or less, meaning that the target has just been destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the target has just been destroyed, then we disable the :ref:"
"`CollisionShape <class_CollisionShape>` by setting it's ``disabled`` "
"property to ``true``. We then make the ``Sphere_Target`` :ref:`MeshInstance "
"<class_MeshInstance>` invisible by setting the ``visible`` property to "
"``false``. We do this so the target can no longer effect the physics world "
"and so the non-broken target mesh is not visible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After this the function then instances the ``RIGID_BODY_TARGET`` scene and "
"adds it as a child of the target. It then sets the ``global_transform`` of "
"the newly instanced scene, called ``clone``, to the ``global_transform`` of "
"the non-broken target. This makes it where the broken target starts at the "
"same position as the non-broken target with the same rotation and scale."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then the function sets the ``destroyed`` variable to ``true`` so the target "
"knows it has been destroyed and calls the ``set_physics_process`` function "
"and passes ``true``. This will start executing the code in "
"``_physics_process`` so that after ``DESTROY_WAIT_TIME`` seconds have "
"passed, the sphere target will free/destroy itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function then gets the :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer3D "
"<class_AudioStreamPlayer3D>` node and calls the ``play`` function so it "
"plays its sound."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, the ``remove_sphere`` function is called in ``Game.gd``. To get "
"``Game.gd``, the code uses the scene tree and works its way from the root of "
"the scene tree to the root of the ``Game.tscn`` scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding the ``remove_sphere`` function to ``Game.gd``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may have noticed we are calling a function in ``Game.gd``, called "
"``remove_sphere``, that we have not defined yet. Open up ``Game.gd`` and add "
"the following additional class variables:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``spheres_left``: The amount of sphere targets left in the world. In the "
"provided ``Game`` scene, there are ``10`` spheres, so that is the initial "
"value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``sphere_ui``: A reference to the sphere UI. We will use this later in the "
"tutorial to display the amount of spheres left in the world."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With these variables defined, we can now add the ``remove_sphere`` function. "
"Add the following code to ``Game.gd``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's go through what this function does real quick:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, it removes one from the ``spheres_left`` variable. It then checks to "
"see if the ``sphere_ui`` variable is not equal to ``null``, and if it is not "
"equal to ``null`` it calls the ``update_ui`` function on ``sphere_ui``, "
"passing in the number of spheres as an argument to the function."
msgstr ""

msgid "We will add the code for ``sphere_ui`` later in this tutorial!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now the ``Sphere_Target`` is ready to be used, but we don't have any way to "
"destroy it. Let's fix that by adding some special :ref:`RigidBody "
"<class_RigidBody>`-based nodes that can damage the targets."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding a pistol"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's add a pistol as the first interactable :ref:`RigidBody "
"<class_RigidBody>` node. Open up ``Pistol.tscn``, which you can find in the "
"``Scenes`` folder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's quickly go over a few things of note in ``Pistol.tscn`` real quick "
"before we add the code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All of the nodes in ``Pistol.tscn`` expect the root node are rotated. This "
"is so the pistol is in the correct rotation relative to the VR controller "
"when it is picked up. The root node is a :ref:`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` "
"node, which we need because we're going to use the "
"``VR_Interactable_Rigidbody`` class we created in the last part of this "
"tutorial series."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a :ref:`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>` node called "
"``Pistol_Flash``, which is a simple mesh that we will be using to simulate "
"the muzzle flash on the end of the pistol's barrel. A :ref:`MeshInstance "
"<class_MeshInstance>` node called ``LaserSight`` is used to as a guide for "
"aiming the pistol, and it follows the direction of the :ref:`Raycast "
"<class_Raycast>` node, called ``Raycast``, that the pistol uses to detect if "
"its 'bullet' hit something. Finally, there is an :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer3D "
"<class_AudioStreamPlayer3D>` node at the end of the pistol that we will use "
"to play the sound of the pistol firing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Feel free to look at the other parts of the scene if you want. Most of the "
"scene is fairly straightforward, with the major changes mentioned above. "
"Select the :ref:`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` node called ``Pistol`` and "
"make a new script called ``Pistol.gd``. Add the following code:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Explaining the pistol code"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, notice how instead of ``extends RigidBody``, we instead have "
"``extends VR_Interactable_Rigidbody``. This makes it where the pistol script "
"extends the ``VR_Interactable_Rigidbody`` class so the VR controllers know "
"this object can be interacted with and that the functions defined in "
"``VR_Interactable_Rigidbody`` can be called when this object is held by a VR "
"controller."
msgstr ""

msgid "Next, let's look at the class variables:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``flash_mesh``: A variable to hold the :ref:`MeshInstance "
"<class_MeshInstance>` node that is used to simulate muzzle flash on the "
"pistol."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``FLASH_TIME``: A constant to define how long the muzzle flash will be "
"visible. This will also define how fast the pistol can fire."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``flash_timer``: A variable to hold the amount of time the muzzle flash has "
"been visible for."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``laser_sight_mesh``: A variable to hold the :ref:`MeshInstance "
"<class_MeshInstance>` node that acts as the pistol's 'laser sight'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``pistol_fire_sound``: A variable to hold the :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer3D "
"<class_AudioStreamPlayer3D>` node used for the pistol's firing sound."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``raycast``: A variable to hold the :ref:`Raycast <class_Raycast>` node that "
"is used for calculating the bullet's position and normal when the pistol is "
"fired."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``BULLET_DAMAGE``: A constant to define the amount of damage a single bullet "
"from the pistol does."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``COLLISION_FORCE``: A constant that defines the amount of force that is "
"applied to :ref:`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` nodes when the pistol's bullet "
"collides."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function gets the nodes and assigns them to their proper variables. For "
"the ``flash_mesh`` and ``laser_sight_mesh`` nodes, both have their "
"``visible`` property set to ``false`` so they are not visible initially."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``_physics_process`` function first checks to see if the pistol's muzzle "
"flash is visible by checking if ``flash_timer`` is more than zero. If "
"``flash_timer`` is more than zero, then we remove time, ``delta`` from it. "
"Next we check if the ``flash_timer`` variable is zero or less now that we "
"removed ``delta`` from it. If it is, then the pistol muzzle flash timer just "
"finished and so we need to make ``flash_mesh`` invisible by setting it's "
"``visible`` property to ``false``."
msgstr ""

msgid "``interact`` function step-by-step explanation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The interact function first checks to see if the pistol's muzzle flash is "
"invisible by checking to see if ``flash_timer`` is less than or equal to "
"zero. We do this so we can limit the rate of fire of the pistol to the "
"length of time the muzzle flash is visible, which is a simple solution for "
"limiting how fast the player can fire."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``flash_timer`` is zero or less, we then set ``flash_timer`` to "
"``FLASH_TIME`` so there is a delay before the pistol can fire again. After "
"that we set ``flash_mesh.visible`` to ``true`` so the muzzle flash at the "
"end of the pistol is visible while ``flash_timer`` is more than zero."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next we call the ``force_raycast_update`` function on the :ref:`Raycast "
"<class_Raycast>` node in ``raycast`` so that it gets the latest collision "
"info from the physics world. We then check if the ``raycast`` hit something "
"by checking if the ``is_colliding`` function is equal to ``true``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the ``raycast`` hit something, then we get the :ref:`PhysicsBody "
"<class_PhysicsBody>` it collided with through the ``get_collider`` function. "
"We assign the hit :ref:`PhysicsBody <class_PhysicsBody>` to a variable "
"called ``body``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We then get the direction of the :ref:`Raycast <class_Raycast>` by getting "
"it's positive ``Z`` directional axis from the :ref:`Basis <class_Basis>` on "
"the ``raycast`` node's ``global_transform``. This will give us the direction "
"the raycast is pointing on the Z axis, which is the same direction as the "
"blue arrow on the :ref:`Spatial <class_Spatial>` gizmo when ``Local space "
"mode`` is enabled in the Godot editor. We store this direction in a variable "
"called ``direction_vector``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next we get the distance from the :ref:`Raycast <class_Raycast>` origin to "
"the :ref:`Raycast <class_Raycast>` collision point by getting the distance "
"from the global position, ``global_transform.origin`` of the ``raycast`` "
"node to the collision point of the :ref:`Raycast <class_Raycast>`, ``raycast."
"get_collision_point``, using the ``distance_to`` function. This will give us "
"the distance the :ref:`Raycast <class_Raycast>` traveled before it collided, "
"which we store in a variable called ``raycast_distance``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then the code checks if the :ref:`PhysicsBody <class_PhysicsBody>`, "
"``body``, has a function/method called ``damage`` using the ``has_method`` "
"function. If the :ref:`PhysicsBody <class_PhysicsBody>` has a function/"
"method called ``damage``, then we call the ``damage`` function and pass "
"``BULLET_DAMAGE`` so it takes damage from the bullet colliding into it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regardless of whether the :ref:`PhysicsBody <class_PhysicsBody>` has a "
"``damage`` function, we then check to see if ``body`` is a :ref:`RigidBody "
"<class_RigidBody>`-based node. If ``body`` is a :ref:`RigidBody "
"<class_RigidBody>`-based node, then we want to push it when the bullet "
"collides."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To calculate the amount of force applied, we simply take ``COLLISION_FORCE`` "
"and divide it by ``raycast_distance``, then we multiply the whole thing by "
"``body.mass``. We store this calculation in a variable called "
"``collision_force``. This will make collisions over a shorter distance apply "
"move force than those over longer distances, giving a *slightly* more "
"realistic collision response."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We then push the :ref:`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` using the "
"``apply_impulse`` function, where the position is a zero Vector3 so the "
"force is applied from the center, and the collision force is the "
"``collision_force`` variable we calculated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regardless of whether the ``raycast`` variable hit something or not, we then "
"play the pistol shot sound by calling the ``play`` function on the "
"``pistol_fire_sound`` variable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, we check to see if the pistol is being held by a VR controller by "
"checking to see if the ``controller`` variable is not equal to ``null``. If "
"it is not equal to ``null``, we then set the ``rumble`` property of the VR "
"controller to ``0.25``, so there is a slight rumble when the pistol fires."
msgstr ""

msgid "``picked_up`` function step-by-step explanation"

msgid ""
"This function simply makes the ``laser_sight_mesh`` :ref:`MeshInstance "

msgid "``dropped`` function step-by-step explanation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid "Pistol finished"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is all we need to do to have working pistols in the project! Go ahead "

msgid "Adding a shotgun"
msgstr ""

msgid "Next let's add a shotgun to the VR project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Adding a special shotgun :ref:`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` should be fairly "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open up ``Shotgun.tscn``, which you can find in the ``Scenes`` folder and "

"tscn``. The only thing that is different, beyond name changes, is that "
"instead of a single :ref:`Raycast <class_Raycast>`, there are five :ref:"
"`Raycast <class_Raycast>` nodes. This is because a shotgun generally fires "
"in a cone shape, so we are going to emulate that effect by having several :"
"ref:`Raycast <class_Raycast>` nodes that will rotate randomly in a cone "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Outside of that, everything is more or less the same as ``Pistol.tscn``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's write the code for the shotgun. Select the :ref:`RigidBody "
