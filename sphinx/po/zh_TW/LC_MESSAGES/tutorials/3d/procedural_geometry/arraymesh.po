msgid "Using the ArrayMesh"
msgstr ""

"This tutorial will present the basics of using an :ref:`ArrayMesh "
"<class_arraymesh>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To do so, we will use the function :ref:`add_surface_from_arrays() "
"<class_ArrayMesh_method_add_surface_from_arrays>`, which takes up to four "
"parameters. The first two are required, while the second two are optional."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first parameter is the ``PrimitiveType``, an OpenGL concept that "
"instructs the GPU how to arrange the primitive based on the vertices given, "
"i.e. whether they represent triangles, lines, points, etc. See :ref:`Mesh."
"PrimitiveType <enum_Mesh_PrimitiveType>` for the options available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second parameter, ``arrays``, is the actual Array that stores the mesh "
"information. The array is a normal Godot array that is constructed with "
"empty brackets ``[]``. It stores a ``Pool**Array`` (e.g. PoolVector3Array, "
"PoolIntArray, etc.) for each type of information that will be used to build "
"the surface."

"The possible elements of ``arrays`` are listed below, together with the "
"position they must have within ``arrays``. See also :ref:`Mesh.ArrayType "

"The array of vertices (at index 0) is always required. The index array is "
"optional and will only be used if included. We won't use it in this tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All the other arrays carry information about the vertices. They are also "
"optional and will only be used if included. Some of these arrays (e.g. "
"``ARRAY_COLOR``) use one entry per vertex to provide extra information about "
"vertices. They must have the same size as the vertex array. Other arrays (e."
"g. ``ARRAY_TANGENT``) use four entries to describe a single vertex. These "
"must be exactly four times larger than the vertex array."

"Here is sample code for generating a sphere. Although the code is presented "
"in GDScript, there is nothing Godot specific about the approach to "
"generating it. This implementation has nothing in particular to do with "
"ArrayMeshes and is just a generic approach to generating a sphere. If you "
"are having trouble understanding it or want to learn more about procedural "
"geometry in general, you can use any tutorial that you find online."
msgstr ""

msgid "Saving"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, we can use the :ref:`ResourceSaver <class_resourcesaver>` class to "
"save the ArrayMesh. This is useful when you want to generate a mesh and then "
"use it later without having to re-generate it."
