"Creating a 3D game can be challenging. That extra Z coordinate makes many of "
"the common techniques that helped to make 2D games simpler no longer work. "
"To aid in this transition, it is worth mentioning that Godot uses similar "
"APIs for 2D and 3D. Most nodes are the same and are present in both 2D and "
"3D versions. In fact, it is worth checking the 3D platformer tutorial, or "
"the 3D kinematic character tutorials, which are almost identical to their 2D "
"counterparts."

"中使用了類似的API。大多數的節點都是相同的，並且存在於 2D 和 3D 版本中。事實"
"上，可以看看 3D 平台遊戲教學或 3D 動力學角色教學，這些教學大部分與 2D 遊戲相"

"Unlike 2D, where loading image content and drawing is straightforward, 3D is "

msgstr ""
"2D 中載入圖像內容和繪圖都非常直觀，3D 則有所不同，會稍微困難一些。3D內容需要"

"There are two pipelines to import 3D models in Godot. The first and most "

"While Godot packs a powerful 2D engine, many types of games use 2D in a 3D "
"environment. By using a fixed camera (either orthogonal or perspective) that "
"does not rotate, nodes such as :ref:`Sprite3D <class_Sprite3D>` and :ref:"

msgid ""
"When working with 3D assets, it's always best to work in the correct scale "
"(set the unit to metric in your 3D modeling software). Godot allows scaling "
"post-import and, while this works in most cases, in rare situations it may "
"introduce floating-point precision issues (and thus, glitches or artifacts) "
"in delicate areas such as rendering or physics. Make sure your artists "
"always work in the right scale!"
msgstr ""
"使用 3D 素材時，最好使用正確的比例（將 DCC 設置為公制）。 Godot 允許在匯入後"
"縮放，雖然這在大多數情況下都有效，但在極少數情況下，它可能會在算繪或物理等精"
