msgid "Introduction to 3D"

msgid ""
"Creating a 3D game can be challenging. That extra Z coordinate makes many of "
"the common techniques that helped to make 2D games simple no longer work. To "
"aid in this transition, it is worth mentioning that Godot uses similar APIs "
"for 2D and 3D. Most nodes are the same and are present in both 2D and 3D "
"versions. In fact, it is worth checking the 3D platformer tutorial, or the "
"3D kinematic character tutorials, which are almost identical to their 2D "
"counterparts."
msgstr ""
"創造一個 3D 遊戲是具有挑戰性的。多了額外的 Z 軸使得許多有助於使製作 2D 遊戲變"
"得簡單的常用技術不再起作用。為了幫助習慣這，值得一提的是，Godot 在 2D 和 3D "
"中使用了類似的API。大多數的節點都是相同的，並且存在於 2D 和 3D 版本中。事實"
"上，可以看看 3D 平台遊戲教學或 3D 動力學角色教學，這些教學大部分與 2D 遊戲相"
"同。"

"In 3D, math is a little more complex than in 2D, so also checking the :ref:"
"`doc_vector_math` entry in the wiki (which was especially created for game "
"developers, not mathematicians or engineers) will help pave the way for you "
"to develop 3D games efficiently."
msgstr ""
"在 3D 中，數學比在 2D 中稍微複雜一些，因此查看 wiki 中的 :ref:"
"`doc_vector_math` （這是專門為遊戲開發人員創建的，而不是數學家或工程師）將有"
"助於為您有效地開發 3D 遊戲。"

msgid "Spatial node"
msgstr "Spatial 節點"

msgid ""
":ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` is the base node for 2D. :ref:`Control "
"<class_Control>` is the base node for everything GUI. Following this "
"reasoning, the 3D engine uses the :ref:`Spatial <class_Spatial>` node for "
"everything 3D."
msgstr ""
":ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` 是 2D 的基礎節點。 :ref:`Control "
"<class_Control>` 是所有 GUI 的基礎節點。同理，3D 引擎使用 :ref:`Spatial "
"<class_Spatial>` 節點來處理所有 3D 內容。"

msgid ""
"Spatial nodes have a local transform, which is relative to the parent node "
"(as long as the parent node is also of **or inherits from** the type "
"Spatial). This transform can be accessed as a 4×3 :ref:`Transform "
"<class_Transform>`, or as 3 :ref:`Vector3 <class_Vector3>` members "
"representing location, Euler rotation (X, Y and Z angles) and scale."
msgstr ""
"Spatial節點有一個局部變換(local transform)，它是相對於父節點的（只要父節點也"
"是 **或者繼承自** Spatial 類型）。這個變換(transform)可以以 4×3 的 :ref:"
"`Transform <class_Transform>` 形式訪問，也可以以 3 個 :ref:`Vector3 "
"<class_Vector3>` 成員並分別代表位置、歐拉旋轉（X、Y、Z 角度）和縮放的形式訪"
"問。"

msgid "3D content"
msgstr "3D 內容"

msgid ""
"Unlike 2D, where loading image content and drawing is straightforward, 3D is "
"a little more difficult. The content needs to be created with special 3D "
"tools (usually referred to as Digital Content Creation tools, or DCCs) and "
"exported to an exchange file format to be imported in Godot. This is "
"required since 3D formats are not as standardized as images."
msgstr ""
"2D 中載入圖像內容和繪圖都非常直觀，3D 則有所不同，會稍微困難一些。3D內容需要"
"使用特殊的 3D 工具（通常稱為數位內容創建工具或Digital Content Creation工具，"
"簡稱DCC）來創建，並匯出成可被 Godot 匯入的交換文件格式。這是必需的，因為 3D "
"格式不像圖像那樣標準化。"

msgid "DCC-created models"
msgstr "DCC 創建的模型"

msgid ""
"There are two pipelines to import 3D models in Godot. The first and most "
"common one is by :ref:`doc_importing_3d_scenes`, which allows you to import "
"entire scenes (just as they look in the DCC), including animation, skeletal "
"rigs, blend shapes, etc."
msgstr ""
"有兩種管道可以匯入 3D 模型到 Godot 中。第一種是最常見的一種，是通過 :ref:"
"`doc_importing_3d_scenes`，它允許匯入整個場景（就像它們在DCC中呈現的那樣），"
"包括動畫、骨架綁定、混合形狀等。"

msgid ""
"The second pipeline is by importing simple .OBJ files as mesh resources, "
"which can be then put inside a :ref:`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>` node "
"for display."
msgstr ""
"第二種管道是通過匯入簡單的 .OBJ檔作為網格資源，然後可以將其放入 :ref:"
"`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>` 節點中顯示。"

msgid "Generated geometry"
msgstr "生成的幾何體"

msgid ""
"It is possible to create custom geometry by using the :ref:`ArrayMesh "
"<class_ArrayMesh>` resource directly. Simply create your arrays and use the :"
"ref:`ArrayMesh.add_surface_from_arrays() "
"<class_ArrayMesh_method_add_surface_from_arrays>` function. A helper class "
"is also available, :ref:`SurfaceTool <class_SurfaceTool>`, which provides a "
"more straightforward API and helpers for indexing, generating normals, "
"tangents, etc."
msgstr ""
"通過直接使用 :ref:`ArrayMesh <class_ArrayMesh>` 資源可以創建自定義幾何體。只"
"需要創建陣列並使用 :ref:`ArrayMesh.add_surface_from_arrays() "
"<class_ArrayMesh_method_add_surface_from_arrays>`函式即可。也可以使用輔助類 :"
"ref:`SurfaceTool <class_SurfaceTool>`，他提供了一個更直接的 API 和幫助工具，"
"用於索引、生成法線和切線等。"

msgid ""
"In any case, this method is meant for generating static geometry (models "
"that will not be updated often), as creating vertex arrays and submitting "
"them to the 3D API has a significant performance cost."
msgstr ""
"在任何情況下，此方法都適用於生成靜態幾何體（不會經常更新的模型），因為創建頂"
"點陣列並將它們提交給 3D API 會產生顯著的性能成本。"

msgid "Immediate geometry"
msgstr "即時幾何體"

msgid ""
"If, instead, there is a requirement to generate simple geometry that will be "
"updated often, Godot provides a special node, :ref:`ImmediateGeometry "
"<class_ImmediateGeometry>`, which provides an OpenGL 1.x style immediate-"
"mode API to create points, lines, triangles, etc."
msgstr ""
"相反，如果需要生成會經常更新的簡單幾何體，Godot 提供了一個特殊的節點 :ref:"
"`ImmediateGeometry <class_ImmediateGeometry>`，它提供了一個 OpenGL 1.x 風格的"
"即時模式 API 來創建點、線和三角形等。"

msgid "2D in 3D"
msgstr "3D環境中的2D"

msgid ""
"While Godot packs a powerful 2D engine, many types of games use 2D in a 3D "
"environment. By using a fixed camera (either orthogonal or perspective) that "
"does not rotate, nodes such as :ref:`Sprite3D <class_Sprite3D>` and :ref:"
"`AnimatedSprite3D <class_AnimatedSprite3D>` can be used to create 2D games "
"that take advantage of mixing with 3D backgrounds, more realistic parallax, "
"lighting/shadow effects, etc."
msgstr ""
"雖然 Godot 包含強大的 2D 引擎，但許多類型的遊戲在 3D 環境中使用 2D 效果。通過"
"使用不旋轉的固定相機（正交或透視），可以使用諸如 :ref:`Sprite3D "
"<class_Sprite3D>` 和 :ref:`AnimatedSprite3D <class_AnimatedSprite3D>` 等節點"
"來創建混合了具有3D背景，更逼真的視差，光照/陰影效果等的 2D 遊戲。"

msgid ""
"The disadvantage is, of course, that added complexity and reduced "
"performance in comparison to plain 2D, as well as the lack of reference of "
"working in pixels."
msgstr ""
"當然，缺點是與普通2D相比增加了複雜性並降低了性能，並且缺乏以像素製作時的參"
"考。"

msgid "Environment"
msgstr "環境"

msgid ""
"Besides editing a scene, it is often common to edit the environment. Godot "
"provides a :ref:`WorldEnvironment <class_WorldEnvironment>` node that allows "
"changing the background color, mode (as in, put a skybox), and applying "
"several types of built-in post-processing effects. Environments can also be "
"overridden in the Camera."
msgstr ""
"除了編輯場景之外，編輯環境通常也很常見。 Godot 提供了一個 :ref:"
"`WorldEnvironment <class_WorldEnvironment>` 節點，該節點允許更改背景顏色、模"
"式（如放置一個天空盒時那樣），並應用多種類型的內置後處理效果。環境也可以在相"
"機中被覆蓋。"

msgid "3D viewport"
msgstr "3D 視窗"

msgid ""
"Editing 3D scenes is done in the 3D tab. This tab can be selected manually, "
"but it will be automatically enabled when a Spatial node is selected."
msgstr ""
"編輯 3D 場景可以在 3D 分頁中完成。此分頁可以手動選擇，但在選擇 Spatial 節點時"
"會自動啟用。"

msgid ""
"Default 3D scene navigation controls are similar to Blender (aiming to have "
"some sort of consistency in the free software pipeline..), but options are "
"included to customize mouse buttons and behavior to be similar to other "
"tools in the Editor Settings:"
msgstr ""
"預設的3D場景導航控制類似於 Blender（旨在在免費軟體工作流程中具有某種一致"
"性），但在編輯器設定中也包含了自定義滑鼠按鈕和行為的選項，能使編輯器操作可像"
"其他的工具："

msgid "Coordinate system"
msgstr "座標系"

msgid ""
"Godot uses the `metric <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system>`__ "
"system for everything in 3D, with 1 unit being equal to 1 meter. Physics and "
"other areas are tuned for this scale. Therefore, attempting to use a "
"different scale is usually a bad idea (unless you know what you are doing)."
msgstr ""
"Godot 在 3D 中使用的都是 `公制(metric)<https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"%E5%85%AC%E5%88%B6>`__ ，1 個單位等於 1 公尺。物理和其他區域都針對這個進行了"
"調整。因此，嘗試使用不同的比例通常是個壞主意（除非您知道自己在做什麼）。"

msgid ""
"When working with 3D assets, it's always best to work in the correct scale "
"(set your DCC to metric). Godot allows scaling post-import and, while this "
"works in most cases, in rare situations it may introduce floating-point "
"precision issues (and thus, glitches or artifacts) in delicate areas such as "
"rendering or physics. Make sure your artists always work in the right scale!"
msgstr ""
"使用 3D 素材時，最好使用正確的比例（將 DCC 設置為公制）。 Godot 允許在匯入後"
"縮放，雖然這在大多數情況下都有效，但在極少數情況下，它可能會在算繪或物理等精"
"細領域引入浮點精度問題（會出現毛刺或失真）。所以請確保藝術家始終以正確的比例"
"工作！"

msgid ""
"The Y coordinate is used for \"up\", though for most objects that need "
"alignment (like lights, cameras, capsule collider, vehicle, etc.), the Z "
"axis is used as a \"pointing towards\" direction. This convention roughly "
"means that:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**X** is sides"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Y** is up/down"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Z** is front/back"
msgstr ""

msgid "Space and manipulation gizmos"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Moving objects in the 3D view is done through the manipulator gizmos. Each "
"axis is represented by a color: Red, Green, Blue represent X, Y, Z "
"respectively. This convention applies to the grid and other gizmos too (and "
"also to the shader language, ordering of components for Vector3, Color, "
"etc.)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some useful keybindings:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To snap placement or rotation, press :kbd:`Ctrl` while moving, scaling or "
"rotating."
msgstr ""

msgid "To center the view on the selected object, press :kbd:`F`."
msgstr ""

msgid "View menu"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The view options are controlled by the \"View\" menu in the viewport's "
"toolbar."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can hide the gizmos in the 3D view of the editor through this menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To hide a specific type of gizmos, you can toggle them off in the \"View\" "
"menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default environment"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When created from the Project Manager, the 3D environment has a default sky."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Given how physically based rendering works, it is advised to always try to "
"work with a default environment in order to provide indirect and reflected "
"light to your objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cameras"
msgstr "攝影機"

msgid ""
"No matter how many objects are placed in the 3D space, nothing will be "
"displayed unless a :ref:`Camera <class_Camera>` is also added to the scene. "
"Cameras can work in either orthogonal or perspective projections:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cameras are associated with (and only display to) a parent or grandparent "
"viewport. Since the root of the scene tree is a viewport, cameras will "
"display on it by default, but if sub-viewports (either as render target or "
"picture-in-picture) are desired, they need their own children cameras to "
"display."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When dealing with multiple cameras, the following rules are enforced for "
"each viewport:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no cameras are present in the scene tree, the first one that enters it "
"will become the active camera. Further cameras entering the scene will be "
"ignored (unless they are set as *current*)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a camera has the \"*current*\" property set, it will be used regardless "
"of any other camera in the scene. If the property is set, it will become "
"active, replacing the previous camera."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an active camera leaves the scene tree, the first camera in tree-order "
"will take its place."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lights"
msgstr "光照"

msgid ""
"Godot has a limit of up to 8 lights per mesh. Aside from that, there is no "
"limitation on the number of lights, nor of types of lights, in Godot. As "
"many as desired can be added, as long as performance allows, and no more "
"than 8 lights shine on a single mesh."
