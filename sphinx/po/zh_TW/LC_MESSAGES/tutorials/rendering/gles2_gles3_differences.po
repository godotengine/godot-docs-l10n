msgid "Differences between GLES2 and GLES3"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This page documents the differences between GLES2 and GLES3 that are by "
"design and are not the result of bugs. There may be differences that are "
"unintentional, but they should be reported as bugs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"GLES2\" and \"GLES3\" are the names used in Godot for the two OpenGL-based "
"rendering backends. In terms of graphics APIs, the GLES2 backend maps to "
"OpenGL 2.1 on desktop, OpenGL ES 2.0 on mobile and WebGL 1.0 on the web. The "
"GLES3 backend maps to OpenGL 3.3 on desktop, OpenGL ES 3.0 on mobile and "
"WebGL 2.0 on the web."
msgstr ""

msgid "Particles"
msgstr "粒子"

msgid ""
"GLES2 cannot use the :ref:`Particles <class_Particles>` or :ref:`Particles2D "
"<class_Particles2D>` nodes as they require advanced GPU features. Instead, "
"use :ref:`CPUParticles <class_CPUParticles>` or :ref:`CPUParticles2D "
"<class_CPUParticles2D>`, which provides a similar interface to a :ref:"
"`ParticlesMaterial <class_ParticlesMaterial>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Particles and Particles2D can be converted to their CPU equivalent node with "
"the \"Convert to CPUParticles\" option in the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid "``SCREEN_TEXTURE`` mip-maps"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In GLES2, ``SCREEN_TEXTURE`` (accessed via a :ref:`ShaderMaterial "
"<class_ShaderMaterial>`) does not have computed mip-maps. So when accessing "
"at a different LOD, the texture will not appear blurry."
msgstr ""

msgid "``DEPTH_TEXTURE``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While GLES2 supports ``DEPTH_TEXTURE`` in shaders, it may not work on some "
"old hardware (especially mobile)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Color space"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GLES2 and GLES3 are in different color spaces. This means that colors will "
"appear slightly different between them especially when lighting is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your game is going to use both GLES2 and GLES3, you can use an ``if`` "
"statement check and see if the output is in sRGB, using ``OUTPUT_IS_SRGB``. "
"``OUTPUT_IS_SRGB`` is ``true`` in GLES2 and ``false`` in GLES3."
msgstr ""

msgid "HDR"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GLES2 is not capable of using High Dynamic Range (HDR) rendering features. "
"If HDR is set for your project, or for a given viewport, Godot will still "
"use Low Dynamic Range (LDR) which limits viewport values to the ``0-1`` "
"range."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Viewport **Debanding** property and associated project setting will also "
"have no effect when HDR is disabled. This means debanding can't be used in "
"GLES2."
msgstr ""

msgid "SpatialMaterial features"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In GLES2, the following advanced rendering features in the :ref:"
"`SpatialMaterial <class_SpatialMaterial>` are missing:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Refraction"
msgstr ""

msgid "Subsurface scattering"
msgstr ""

msgid "Anisotropy"
msgstr ""

msgid "Clearcoat"
msgstr ""

msgid "Depth mapping"
msgstr ""

msgid "When using SpatialMaterials they will not even appear in the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In custom :ref:`ShaderMaterials <class_ShaderMaterial>`, you can set values "
"for these features but they will be non-functional. For example, you will "
"still be able to set the ``SSS`` built-in (which normally adds subsurface "
"scattering) in your shader, but nothing will happen."
msgstr ""

msgid "Environment features"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In GLES2, the following features in the :ref:`Environment "
"<class_Environment>` are missing:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Auto exposure"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tonemapping"
msgstr ""

msgid "Screen space reflections"
msgstr ""

msgid "Screen space ambient occlusion"
msgstr ""

msgid "GIProbes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`GIProbes <class_GIProbe>` do not work in GLES2. Instead use :ref:"
"`Baked Lightmaps <class_BakedLightmap>`. For a description of how baked "
"lightmaps work see the :ref:`Baked Lightmaps tutorial <doc_baked_lightmaps>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Contact shadows"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``shadow_contact`` property of :ref:`Lights <class_Light>` is not "
"supported in GLES2 and so does nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Light performance"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In GLES2, performance scales poorly with several lights, as each light is "
"processed in a separate render pass (in opposition to GLES3 which is all "
"done in a single pass). Try to limit scenes to as few lights as possible in "
"order to achieve greatest performance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Texture compression"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On mobile, GLES2 requires ETC texture compression, while GLES3 requires "
"ETC2. ETC2 is enabled by default, so if exporting to mobile using GLES2 make "
"sure to set the project setting ``rendering/vram_compression/import_etc`` "
"and then reimport textures."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since ETC doesn't support transparency, you must reimport textures that "
"contain an alpha channel to use the Uncompressed, Lossy or Lossless "
"compression mode (instead of Video RAM). This can be done in the Import dock "
"after selecting them in the FileSystem dock."
msgstr ""

msgid "Blend shapes"
msgstr ""

msgid "Blend shapes are not supported in GLES2."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shading language"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GLES3 provides many built-in functions that GLES2 does not. Below is a list "
"of functions that are not available or are have limited support in GLES2."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a complete list of built-in GLSL functions see the :ref:`Shading "
