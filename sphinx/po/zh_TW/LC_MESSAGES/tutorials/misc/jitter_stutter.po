"*Jitter* and *stutter* are two different alterations to visible motion of "
"objects on screen that may affect a game, even when running at full speed. "
"These effects are mostly visible in games where the world moves at a "
"constant speed in a fixed direction, like runners or platformers."

"There can be many causes of jitter, the most typical one happens when the "
"game *physics frequency* (usually 60 Hz) runs at a different resolution than "
"the monitor refresh rate. Check whether your monitor refresh rate is "
"different from 60 Hz."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/misc/jitter_stutter.rst:35
msgid ""
"This is generally not a problem, given that most monitors are 60 Hz, and "
"starting with Godot 3.1, a frame timer was introduced that tries to "
"synchronize with refresh as well as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes only some objects appear to jitter (character or background). This "
"happens when they are processed in different time sources (one is processed "
"in the physics step while another is processed in the idle step). Godot 3.1 "
"does some improvements to this, from allowing kinematic bodies to be "
"animated in the regular _process loop, to further fixes in the frame timer."

"You can use physics interpolation to mitigate physics-related jittering. See "
"`lawnjelly's smoothing-addon <https://github.com/lawnjelly/smoothing-"
"addon>`__ for an add-on that can be dropped into any project to enable "
"physics interpolation."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/misc/jitter_stutter.rst:52
msgid ""
"Stutter may happen due to two different reasons. The first, and most obvious "
"one, is the game not being able to keep full framerate performance. Solving "
"this is game specific and will require optimization."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/misc/jitter_stutter.rst:55
msgid ""
"The second is more complicated, because it is often not associated to the "
"engine or game but the underlying operating system. Here is some information "
"regarding stutter on different OSs."

"Windows is known to cause stutter in windowed games. This mostly depends on "
"the hardware installed, drivers version and processes running in parallel (e."
"g. having many browser tabs open may cause stutter in a running game). To "
"avoid this, starting with 3.1, Godot raises the game priority to \"Above "
"Normal\". This helps considerably but may not completely eliminate stutter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/misc/jitter_stutter.rst:66
msgid ""
"Eliminating this completely requires giving your game full privileges to "
"become \"time critical\", which is not advised. Some games may do it, but it "
"is advised to learn to live with this problem, as it is common for Windows "
"games and most users won't play games windowed (games that are played in a "
"window, e.g. puzzle games, will usually not exhibit this problem anyway)."

"For fullscreen, Windows gives special priority to the game so stutter is no "

"Stutter may be visible on Desktop Linux, but this is usually associated with "
"different video drivers and compositors. Nouveau drivers often exhibit this, "
"while AMD or NVidia proprietary don't. Some compositors may also trigger "
"this problem (e.g. KWin), so it is advised to try using a different one to "
"rule it out as the cause."
