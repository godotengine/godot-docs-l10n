"DirectDraw Surface (``.dds``) - If mipmaps are present in the texture, they "
"will be loaded directly. This can be used to achieve effects using custom "
"mipmaps."
msgstr ""
"DirectDraw Surface (``.dds``) - 若紋理中有 Mipmap，則會直接載入 Mipmap。可以"

"SVG (``.svg``, ``.svgz``) - SVGs are rasterized using `NanoSVG <https://"
"github.com/memononen/nanosvg>`__ when importing them. Support is limited; "
"complex vectors may not render correctly. For complex vectors, rendering "
"them to PNGs using Inkscape is often a better solution. This can be "

msgid "Importing textures"
msgstr "匯入紋理"

msgid ""
"The default action in Godot is to import images as textures. Textures are "
"stored in video memory and can't be accessed directly. This is what makes "
"drawing them efficient."
msgstr ""
"Godot 中的預設操作是將圖片匯入為紋理。紋理保存在視訊記憶體中，無法直接存取。"
"這樣一來也能有效率地繪製。"

msgid "Import options are vast:"
msgstr "有許多匯入選項："

msgid "Detect 3D"
msgstr "偵測3D"

msgid ""
"This option makes Godot be aware of when a texture (which is imported for 2D "
"as default) is used in 3D. If this happens, setting are changed so the "
"texture flags are friendlier to 3D (mipmaps, filter and repeat become "
"enabled and compression is changed to VRAM). Texture is also reimported "
"automatically."
msgstr ""
"通過該選項可以讓 Godot 紋理何時使用於 3D (紋理預設匯入為 2D)。若該選項開啟"
"後，會變更設定，以讓旗標能對 3D 更友善 (Mipmap, Filter 與 Repeat 會變為啟用，"
"Compress 會改為 VRAM)。貼圖也會自動重新匯入。"

msgid "Compression"
msgstr "壓縮"

msgid ""
"Images are one of the largest assets in a game. To handle them efficiently, "
"they need to be compressed. Godot offers several compression methods, "
"depending on the use case."
msgstr ""
"圖片是遊戲中其中一個最大的素材。為了有效率地處理圖片，應該進行壓縮。Godot 依"
"據使用情況，提供了數種壓縮方法。"

msgid "Compress Mode"
msgstr "壓縮模式"

msgid ""
"**VRAM Compression:** This is the most common compression mode for 3D "
"assets. Size on disk is reduced and video memory usage is also decreased "
"considerably (usually by a factor between 4 and 6). This mode should be "
"avoided for 2D as it exhibits noticeable artifacts."
msgstr ""
"**VRAM 壓縮：** 3D 素材中最常見的壓縮方式。可以減少硬碟暫用與記憶體使用 (通常"
"介於 4 倍與 6 倍間)。由於會出現明顯的噪點，建議不要在 2D 素材上使用。"

msgid ""
"**Lossless Compression:** This is the most common compression mode for 2D "
"assets. It shows assets without any kind of artifacting, and disk "
"compression is decent. It will use considerably more amount of video memory "
"than VRAM Compression, though. This is also the recommended setting for "
"pixel art."
msgstr ""
"**Lossless - 無損壓縮：** 最常用於 2D 素材。不會顯示出噪點，也有適當地壓縮硬"
"碟空間。雖然通常會使用比 VRAM 壓縮更多的視訊記憶體。該模式也建議用於像素畫 "
"(Pixel Art)。"

msgid ""
"**Lossy Compression:** This is a good choice for large 2D assets. It has "
"some artifacts, but less than VRAM and the file size is several times lower "
"compared to Lossless or Uncompressed. Video memory usage isn't decreased by "
"this mode; it's the same as with Lossless Compression or Uncompressed."
msgstr ""
"**Lossy - 有損壓縮：** 有損壓縮適合用於大型 2D 素材。會產生噪點，但比 VRAM "
"少，且檔案大小比起無損壓縮或無壓縮也小了數倍。此種模式並未降低視訊記憶體使用"
"量，與 Lossless 無損壓縮及 Uncompressed 無壓縮相同。"

msgid ""
"**Uncompressed:** Only useful for formats that can't be compressed (such as "
"raw float images)."
msgstr ""
"**Uncompressed - 無壓縮：** 只適用於無法壓縮的格式 (如 raw float 圖片)。"

"When using a texture as normal map, only the red and green channels are "

msgstr ""
"當使用作為法線映射的紋理貼圖時，只需要紅色與綠色通道。使用一般的紋理貼圖壓縮"
"演算法會產生噪點，使法線映射不那麼好看。RGTC 壓縮格式最適合用於此資料。將該選"
"項強制設為「Enabled」會使 Godot 以 RGTC 壓縮匯入圖片。預設情況下，該選項設為"
"「Detect」則代表若貼圖有用於法線映射，則會自動更改為「Enabled」並重新匯入。"

"to be converted so its Y axis is flipped."
msgstr ""
"Godot 中的法線映射必須使用 X+, Y- 與 Z+ 座標。換句話說，若匯入使用於其他引擎"

msgid "Repeat"

msgid "Filter"

msgid ""
"When pixels become larger than the screen pixels, this option enables linear "
