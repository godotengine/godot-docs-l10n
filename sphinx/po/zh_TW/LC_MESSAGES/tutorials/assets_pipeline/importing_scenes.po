"Since GPUs can only render triangles, meshes that contain quads or N-gons "

"whenever possible."

msgid ""
"To avoid issues with incorrect triangulation after importing in Godot, it is "
"recommended to make the 3D DCC triangulate objects on its own. In Blender, "
"this can be done by adding a Triangulate modifier to your objects and making "
