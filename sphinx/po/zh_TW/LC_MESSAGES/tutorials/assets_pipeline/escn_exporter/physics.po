msgid "Physics properties"
msgstr "物理屬性"

msgid ""
"Exporting physics properties is done by enabling \"Rigid Body\" in Blender's "
"physics tab:"
msgstr "可在 Blender 的物理分頁中啟用「剛體」來匯出物理屬性："

msgid ""
"By default, a single Blender object with rigid body enabled will export as "
"three nodes: a PhysicsBody, a CollisionShape, and a MeshInstance."
msgstr ""
"預設情況下，有啟用剛體的單一 Blender 物件會以三個節點匯出：PyysicsBody、"
"CollisionShape 與 MeshInstance。"

msgid "Body type"
msgstr "物體類型"

msgid ""
"Blender only has the concept of \"Active\" and \"Passive\" rigid bodies. "
"These turn into Static and RigidBody nodes. To create a kinematic body, "
"enable the \"animated\" checkbox on an \"Active\" body:"
msgstr ""
"Blender 的剛體只有「作用中」與「被動」兩種類別，分別會轉為 Static 與 "
"RigidBody 節點。若要建立 Kinematic Body，請於「作用中」剛體勾選「動畫」："

msgid "Collision shapes"
msgstr "碰撞形體"

msgid ""
"Many of the parameters for collision shapes are missing from Blender, and "
"many of the collision shapes are also not present. However, almost all of "
"the options in Blender's rigid body collision and rigid body dynamics "
"interfaces are supported:"
msgstr ""
"Blender 中缺少了許多碰撞區域的參數，而且也缺少許多碰撞區域。但 Blender 剛體中"
"大部分的碰撞與剛體動力學介面都支援："

msgid "There are the following caveats:"
msgstr "有下列事項需注意："

msgid ""
"Not all of the collision shapes are supported. Only ``Mesh``, ``Convex "
"Hull``, ``Capsule``, ``Sphere`` and ``Box`` are supported in both Blender "
"and Godot"
msgstr ""
"並非所有碰撞區域都支援。只有 ``Mesh``, ``Convex Hull``, ``Capsule``, "
"``Sphere`` 與 ``Box`` 能同時在 Blender 與 Godot 中支援"

msgid ""
"In Godot, you can have different collision groups and collision masks. In "
"Blender you only have collision groups. As a result, the exported object's "
"collision mask is equal to its collision group. Most of the time, this is "
"what you want."
msgstr ""
"在 Godot 中能使用不同的碰撞群組與碰撞遮罩，但在 Blender 中只能使用碰撞群組。"
"因此，匯出物件的碰撞遮罩與其碰撞群組相同。大多數時候，其結果符合需求。"

msgid ""
"To build compound physics shapes, parent together multiple objects with "
"rigid body enabled. The physics properties are taken from the parent-most "
"rigid body, and the rest are used as collision shapes."
msgstr ""
"要建置複合物理形狀，請以啟用剛體的多個物件來組成父級結構。物理屬性將由最上層"
"的父級剛體取得，剩下的剛體則用作碰撞區域。"

msgid "Collision geometry only"
msgstr "僅幾何碰撞"

msgid ""
"Frequently you want different geometry for your collision meshes and your "
"graphical meshes, but by default, the exporter will export a mesh along with "
"the collision shape. To only export the collision shape, set the object's "
"maximum draw type to Wire:"
msgstr ""
"許多時候會需要在碰撞網格與圖形網格上使用不同的幾何，但預設情況下，匯出工具會"
"把網格與碰撞區域一起匯出。若有只匯出碰撞區域，請將物件的最大描繪類型設為"
"「線」："

msgid ""
"This will also influence how the object is shown in Blender's viewport. Most "
"of the time, you want your collision geometry to be shown see-through when "
"working on the models, so this works out fairly nicely."
msgstr ""
"這個設定也會影響物件如何在 Blender 視接口中顯示。大多數時候，在處理模型是我們"
"會需要將碰撞幾何都會顯示為半透明的，所以這樣設定也沒什麼問題。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
