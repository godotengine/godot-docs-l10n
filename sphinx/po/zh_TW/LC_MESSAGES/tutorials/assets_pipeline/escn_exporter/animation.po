msgid "Multiple Actions For Single Object"
msgstr "對單一物件的多個動作"

msgid ""
"In most games, one object would have several animations to switch between. "
"This add-on has support for exporting multiple actions all at once into a "
"single AnimationPlayer and makes it easy to switch actions."
msgstr ""
"大多數遊戲中，同一個物件會需要有數種動畫可以切換。這個擴充外掛支援一次將多個"
"動作匯出至單一 AnimationPlayer，以更容易切換動作。"

msgid ""
"This workflow makes use of blender nla_tracks. Here is a brief guide on how "
"to use this feature:"
msgstr "本工作流程使用 Blender 的 nla_tracks。下列介紹了如何使用本功能："

msgid "**1. Stash active action**"
msgstr "**1. 暫存作用中動作**"

msgid ""
"New created action is always an active action bound to object. There are "
"several ways to place an active action into NLA track, one is of course "
"doing it in ``NLA Editor``"
msgstr ""
"新建立的動作會設為物件的作用中動作。有各種方法可以將作用中動作放至 NLA 軌中，"
"其中一種方法當然是在 ``NLA 編輯器`` 中進行"

msgid "Or it can be done stashing the action in ``Dope Sheet``"
msgstr "或者也可以將動作暫存至 ``律表`` 中來完成"

msgid "**2. Check mute status of NLA tracks**"
msgstr "**2. 檢查 NLA 軌道的閉鎖狀態**"

msgid ""
"An NLA track can be ``mute`` or ``unmute``, the exporter will export all the "
"``mute`` NLA track as a separate action, while blends all the ``unmute`` NLA "
"tracks into every action (including the action) being exported."
msgstr ""
"NLA 軌道可以為 ``閉鎖`` 或 ``非閉鎖`` ，匯出工具會將所有 ``閉鎖`` NLA 軌道匯"
"出至單獨的動作，但會混合所有 ``非閉鎖`` NLA 軌道至匯出的每一個動作中 (包含活"
"動動作)。"

msgid "**3. Export the scene**"
msgstr "**3. 匯出場景**"

msgid "Make sure the ``Export Stashed Actions`` option has been turned on."
msgstr "先確定有開啟 ``Export Stashed Action`` 選項。"

msgid ""
"Then all the stashed actions, as well as the active action, are exported to "
"an AnimationPlayer."
msgstr "接著所有暫存動作與活動動作都會匯出至 AnimationPlayer。"

msgid "Constraints"
msgstr "制約"

msgid ""
"Sometimes complicated animation is built with object constraint; a usual "
"example is inverse kinematics. The add-on would automatically check if an "
"object has some constraint; if it does, all the constraints are baked into "
"actions and then exported along with the object."
msgstr ""
"有時複雜的動畫會以物件制約來製作，常見的例子即為反轉運動學。本擴充外掛會自動"
"檢查物件是否有約束，若有約束則會將所有約束都烘焙至動作中，並與物件一起匯出。"

msgid "Animation Mode"
msgstr "動畫模式"

msgid ""
"Godot and Blender have different structure to store animation data. In Godot "
"animation data is stored in an AnimationPlayer node, instead of in each "
"animated node. In order to fix this inconsistence and still make the "
"animation play versatile, this add-on has three animation exporting modes."
msgstr ""
"Godot 與 Blender 以不同的結構來儲存動畫資料。Godot 中的動畫資料不是儲存在個別"
"動畫節點，而是於 AnimationPlayer 節點中。為了保持動畫播放多樣性，並修正不一"
"致，本擴充外掛提供了三種動畫匯出模式。"

msgid "**Mode 'Animation as Actions'**"
msgstr "**「Animation as Actions」模式**"

msgid ""
"Treat all the animations as object actions, so in the exported scene, every "
"object would have its own AnimationPlayer and hold its actions."
msgstr ""
"將所有動畫都當作物件動作，因此在匯出場景中，所有物件都會將動作保存於各自的 "
"AnimationPlayer 中。"

msgid "**Mode 'Scene Animation'**"
msgstr "**「Scene Animation」模式**"

msgid ""
"If you want your animation to generate the same result as playing at "
"Blender's timeline, this is what you want. In this mode, all the animations "
"in the scene are placed in just one AnimationPlayer in the scene root."
msgstr ""
"若要讓動畫產生與在 Blender 時間軸上播放時相同的結果，則應選擇本模式。本模式會"
"將場景中所有動畫放置於場景根節點的單一 AnimationPlayer 中。"

msgid "**Mode 'Animation as Action with Squash'**"
msgstr "**「Animation as Action with Squash」模式**"

msgid ""
"This mode has very similar behavior of mode 'Animation as Action', but it "
"can generate fewer AnimationPlayers; objects in parent-children relationship "
"would share their AnimationPlayer. It is useful when you have several rigs, "
"and each Skeleton and Mesh has actions; then one rig would have just one "
"AnimationPlayer."
msgstr ""
"本模式的行為與「Animation as Action」很像，但產生的 AnimationPlayer 比較少。"
"在父級-子級關係中的物件會共用 AnimationPlayer。適合用於有多個綁定關係、骨骼與"
"網格都有各自的動作時，一個綁定就只會有一個 AnimationPlayer。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
