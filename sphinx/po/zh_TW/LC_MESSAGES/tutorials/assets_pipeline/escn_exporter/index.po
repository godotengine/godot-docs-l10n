"This plugin can be used to export Blender scenes in a Godot-specific scene "
"format called ESCN, which is similar to TSCN (text format) but will be "
"imported as binary SCN for performance."
msgstr ""
"該外掛可用來匯出 Blender 場景至 Godot 專有的場景格式，ESCN。該格式與 TSCN (文"
"字格式) 類似，但會以二進位 SCN 匯入，以提高效能。"

msgid "Details on exporting"
msgstr "匯入詳情"

msgid "Disabling specific objects"
msgstr "禁用特定物件"

msgid ""
"Sometimes you don't want some objects exported (e.g. high-res models used "
"for baking). An object will not be exported if it is not rendered in the "
"scene. This can be set in the outliner:"
msgstr ""
"有時會需要不讓某些物件匯出 (如用於烘焙的高解析模型)。若物件未於場景中算繪則不"
"會匯出。可於大綱管理器中設定："

msgid ""
"Objects hidden in the viewport will be exported, but will be hidden in the "
"Godot scene."
msgstr "於視接口中隱藏的物件也會被匯出，但會於 Godot 中場景中隱藏。"

msgid "Build pipeline integration"
msgstr "建置管線整合"

msgid ""
"If you have hundreds of model files, you don't want your artists to waste "
"time manually exporting their blend files. To combat this, the exporter "
"provides a python function ``io_scene_godot.export(out_file_path)`` that can "
"be called to export a file. This allows easy integration with other build "
"systems. An example Makefile and python script that exports all the blends "
"in a directory are present in the Godot-Blender-exporter repository."
msgstr ""
"若有數百個模型檔時，我們會需要避免讓藝術家浪費時間在匯出 Blend 檔案。為此，匯"
"出工具中有一個 Python 函式 ``io_scene_godot.export(輸出檔案路徑)`` 可用於呼叫"
"來匯出檔案。該函式能用來與其他建置系統整合。Godot-Blender-exporter 儲存庫中有"
"提供一個範例 Makefile 與 python 腳本，可匯出一資料夾中所有的 Blend 檔案。"
