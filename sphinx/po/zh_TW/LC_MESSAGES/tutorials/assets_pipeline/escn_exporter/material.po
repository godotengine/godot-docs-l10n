msgstr "材質"

msgid "Using existing Godot materials"
msgstr "使用現有的 Godot 材質"

"One way in which the exporter can handle materials is to attempt to match "
"the Blender material with an existing Godot material. This has the advantage "
"of being able to use all of the features of Godot's material system, but it "
"means that you cannot see your model with the material applied inside "
"Blender."
msgstr ""
"匯出工具處理材質的其中一個方法為嘗試將 Blender 材質與現有的 Godot 材質做配"
"對。這樣做的優點即為能使用 Godot 材質系統的所有功能，但也代表看不到有在 "
"Blender 中套用材質的模型。"

msgid ""
"To do this, the exporter attempts to find Godot materials with names that "
"match those of the material name in Blender. So if you export an object in "
"Blender with the material name ``PurpleDots`` then the exporter will search "
"for the file ``PurpleDots.tres`` and assign it to the object. If this file "
"is not a ``SpatialMaterial`` or ``ShaderMaterial`` or if it cannot be found, "
"then the exporter will fall back to exporting the material from Blender."
msgstr ""
"為此，匯出工具會在 Godot 中找出與 Blender 上相同名稱的材質。所以當從 Blender "
"中匯出包含有 ``PurpleDots`` 材質的物件時，匯出工具會尋找 ``PurpleDots.tres`` "
"檔案並指派至物件中。若 PurpleDots.tres 不是 ``SpatialMaterial`` 或 "
"``ShaderMaterial`` 或找不到該檔案，則匯出工具會轉而將 Blender 中的材質匯出。"

msgid ""
"Where the exporter searches for the ``.tres`` file is determined by the "
"\"Material Search Paths\" option:"
msgstr ""
"匯出工具尋找 ``.tres`` 的位置是由「Material Search Path」選項來判斷的："

msgid "This can take the value of:"
msgstr "有下列選項："

msgid ""
"Project Directory - Attempts to find the ``project.Godot`` and recursively "
"searches through subdirectories. If ``project.Godot`` cannot be found it "
"will throw an error. This is useful for most projects where naming conflicts "
"are unlikely."
msgstr ""
"Project Directory - 專案資料夾：會嘗試尋找 ``project.Godot`` 並遞迴搜尋子資料"
"夾。若找不到 ``project.Godot`` 則會拋出錯誤。適用於沒有衝突名稱的專案。"

msgid ""
"Export Directory - Look for materials in subdirectories of the export "
"location. This is useful for projects where you may have duplicate material "
"names and need more control over what material gets assigned."
msgstr ""
"Export Directory - 匯出資料夾：於匯出路徑中的子資料夾內尋找材質。適用於有重複"
"材質名稱且需要控制所指派材質的專案。"

msgid "None - Do not search for materials. Export them from the Blender file."
msgstr "None - 無：不搜尋材質，從 Blender 檔案中匯出。"

msgid "Export of Cycles/EEVEE materials"
msgstr "匯出 Cycles/EEVEE 材質"

msgid ""
"The exporter has a primitive support for converting Cycles/EEVEE material "
"node tree to Godot Shader Material. Note that some of the Shader Node are "
"not supported yet due to difficulties in implementation, which are:"
msgstr ""
"匯出工具對於將 Cycles/EEVEE 材質節點樹轉換為 Godot Shader Material 有基本支"
"持。請注意，有些 Shader Node 由於難以實作所以尚未支援。未支援的 Shader Node "

msgid "all the ``noisy textures``"

"shader nodes except ``PrincipledBSDF``, ``Diffuse``, ``Glossy``, ``Glass``, "
"``add shader`` and ``mix shader``"
msgstr ""
"除了 ``PrincipledBSDF``, ``Diffuse``, ``Glossy``, ``Glass``, ``add shader`` "
"與 ``mix shader`` 以外的 Shader Node"

msgid ""
"If possible, try to use PrincipledBSDF node with GGX distribution as the "
"output shader node, it is the only one guaranteed to be exactly correct. "
"Others are just based on approximation."
msgstr ""
"如果可以的話，請儘量使用 GGX 分佈的 PrincipledBSDF 作為輸出 Shader Node，只有"
"這種 Shader Node 能保證產生完全正確的結果。其他 Shader Node 則只能產生相近結"
"果。"

msgid ""
"Sometimes materials may not be valid for exporting (e.g. has some "
"unsupported node) or it is using Blender Internal Engine, only the diffuse "
"color and a few flags (e.g. unshaded) are exported and form a Spatial "
"Material."
msgstr ""
"有時材質可能無法用於匯出 (如有不支援的節點)，或材質使用 Blender Internal "
"Engine。僅有漫射色彩與一些旗標 (如 Unshaded) 會從 Sparial Material 中匯出。"

msgid "Generate external materials"
msgstr "產生外部材質"

msgid ""
"The default configuration of material exporting would keep all the materials "
"internal to the ``escn`` file. There is an option which could enable "
"generating external ``.material`` file when the ``escn`` file opens in Godot."
msgstr ""
"匯出材質的預設設定會將所有的材質都放在 ``escn`` 檔案內。可設定選項來讓 Godot "

msgid ""
"``.material`` file can be assigned to any material slot to be a external "
