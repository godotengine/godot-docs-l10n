msgid "Modifiers"
msgstr "修改器"

msgid ""
"There is an exporting option :code:`Apply Modifiers` to control whether mesh "
"modifiers are applied to the exported mesh."
msgstr ""
"匯出選項 ``Apply Modifier`` (套用修改器) 可以控制是否要將網格修改器套用至匯出"
"的網格中。"

msgid "Shape Key"
msgstr "外形鍵"

msgid ""
"Exporting mesh shape key is supported, however exporting each shape key is "
"almost like exporting the mesh again, so don't be surprised it takes a "
"relatively long time."
msgstr ""
"也支援匯出網格外形鍵，但匯出每個網格鍵相當於再次匯出網格，因此顯然會需要花上"
"相對長的時間。"

msgid ""
"A lot of modifiers are not compatible with shape keys (e.g. subsurface "
"modifier), so if you found you have incorrect shape keys exported, try to "
"disable :code:`Apply Modifiers` and do the exporting again. Besides, it is "
"worthwhile to report the incompatible modifier to the `issue list <https://"
"github.com/godotengine/godot-blender-exporter/issues>`__, which helps to "
"develop the exporter to have a more precise check of modifiers."
msgstr ""
"許多修改器並不與形狀鍵相容 (如次表面修改鍵)，因此若匯出了錯誤的形狀鍵，請禁"
"用 ``Apply Modifiers`` 後再匯出一次。另外，也建議在 `Issue 列表 <https://"
"github.com/godotengine/godot-blender-exporter/issues>`__ 中回報不相容的修改"
"器，以協助匯出工具的開發能更精確地檢查修改器。"
