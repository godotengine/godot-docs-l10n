"Armature object in Blender is exported as a Skeleton node along with rest "
"position (transform in Godot) of bones."
msgstr ""
"Blender 中的骨架物件 (Armature) 會與 (在 Godot 中變換的) 骨骼靜止位置一起匯出"
"為骨架節點 (Skeleton)。"

"The three check boxes :code:`Inherit Rotation`, :code:`Inherit Scale`, :code:"
"`Local Location` (colored in red) must be ticked when building armature in "
"Blender, so that the exported bone transform be consistent between Blender "
"and Godot"
msgstr ""
"在 Blender 中建立骨骼時必須要勾選三個勾選框： ``繼承旋轉`` 、``繼承縮放`` 、 "
"``區域位置`` (以紅色標識)，這樣一來匯出的骨骼才能在 Blender 與 Godot 變換換一"

"It is important that the mesh is not deformed by bones when exporting in "
"Blender. Make sure that the skeleton is reset to its T-pose or default rest "
"pose."
msgstr ""
"請注意，從 Blender 匯出的網格並不會被骨骼所變形。請確保已重設骨骼姿勢至 T-"
"Pose 或預設靜止姿勢。"

msgid "Bone Weights"
msgstr "骨骼權重"

msgid ""
"Blender put rigged mesh vertices which has no bone weights at its original "
"position, but these vertices would be placed at (0, 0, 0) in Godot, making "
"the mesh deformed. Therefore, the exporter would raise an error for any "
"vertex with no bone weights detected in a rigged mesh."
msgstr ""
"Blender 會將沒有骨骼權重的綁定網格頂點放置於原始位置，但這些頂點在 Godot 中會"
"被放在 (0, 0, 0)，並使網格變形。因此，匯出工具會在有無權重骨骼的綁定網格頂點"
"提示錯誤。"

msgid "Non-Deform Bone"
msgstr "非變形骨骼"

msgid ""
"Note that the non-deform bone can be configured as not exported by enabling "
"the :code:`Exclude Control Bones`; the deform bone checkbox is shown in the "
"picture."
msgstr ""
"請注意，可以在匯出工具中啟用 ``Exclude Control Bones`` 來讓非變形骨骼不被匯"
"出。非變形骨骼勾選框顯示於上圖。"

msgid "Bone Attachment"
msgstr "骨骼附件"

msgid ""
"A bone can be the parent of an object in Blender; this relation is exported "
"as a BoneAttachment node in the Godot scene."
msgstr ""
"在 Blender 中，骨骼可以為另一個物件的父級。這種關係會匯出為 Godot 場景中的 "
"BoneAttachment 節點。"
