"Godot provides three options to import your audio data: WAV, Ogg Vorbis and "
"MP3."
msgstr ""
"原始音訊檔通常都很大，而且我們通常都不會想用原始檔。Godot 中提供了兩個主要選"
"項來匯入音訊資料：WAV 與 Ogg Vorbis。"

msgid "Each has different advantages."
msgstr "各有優點。"

"WAV files use raw data or light compression (IMA-ADPCM). They are "
"lightweight on the CPU to play back (hundreds of simultaneous voices in this "
"format are fine). The downside is that they take up a lot of disk space."
msgstr ""
"WAV 檔使用原始資料或輕度壓縮，播放時不太吃 CPU (使用該格式可同時播放數百個聲"
"音)，但該檔案格式會佔用許多空間。"

msgid ""
"Ogg Vorbis files use a stronger compression that results in much smaller "
"file size, but require significantly more processing power to play back."
msgstr ""
"Ogg Vorbis 檔使用強力壓縮，因此檔案大小較小，但需要更多的效能才能播放。"

msgid ""
"MP3 files use better compression than WAV with IMA-ADPCM, but worse than Ogg "
"Vorbis. This means that a MP3 file with roughly equal quality to Ogg Vorbis "
"will be significantly larger. On the bright side, MP3 requires less CPU "
"usage to play back compared to Ogg Vorbis. This makes MP3 useful for mobile "
"and HTML5 projects where CPU resources are limited, especially when playing "
"multiple compressed sounds at the same time (such as long ambient sounds)."

"Godot has an :ref:`extensive bus system <doc_audio_buses>` with built-in "
"effects. This saves SFX artists the need to add reverb to the sound effects, "
"reducing their size greatly and ensuring correct trimming. Say no to SFX "
"with baked reverb!"
msgstr ""
"Godot 中有自帶許多特效的 :ref:`豐富匯流排系統 <doc_audio_buses>` 。得益於該系"
"統，SFX 藝術家便無需在音效檔中處理殘響，可有效降低檔案大小並能確保剪輯正確。"
"再也不需要烘焙殘響 SFX 了！"

msgid "As you can see above, sound effects become huge with reverb added."
msgstr "就像這樣，包含殘響的音效檔變得很大。"

msgid "Trimming"
msgstr "Trimming - 剪裁"

msgid ""
"One issue that happens often is that the waveform is exported with long "
"silences at the beginning and at the end. These are inserted by DAWs when "
"saving to a waveform, increase their size unnecessarily and add latency to "
"the moment they are played back."
msgstr ""
"音訊檔前後有很長一段無聲音的時間也是其中一種常見問題。這段無聲的時間通常是由 "
"DAW 在保存波形時插入的，這會導致檔案大小沒必要地增加，並讓播放時產生延遲。"

msgid "Importing as WAV with the **Trimming** option enabled solves this."
msgstr "匯入 WAV 時開啟 **Trimming** 選項可解決此問題。"

msgid "Looping"
msgstr "Looping - 循環"

msgid ""
"Godot supports looping in the samples (tools such as Sound Forge or Audition "
"can add loop points to WAV files). This is useful for sound effects, such as "
"engines, machine guns etc. Ping-pong looping is also supported."
msgstr ""
"Godot 中支援在採樣中循環 (如 Soud Forge 或 Audition 等工具可以在 WAV 檔插入循"
"環點)。適用於音效，如引擎或機械槍等聲音。另也支援乒乓式循環 (Ping-pong)。"

"As an alternative, the Import dock has a **Loop** option that enables "
"looping for the entire sample when importing."
msgstr "此外，匯入 Dock 中的 **Loop** 選項也可用於在匯入時開啟整段採樣的循環。"
