"The following explains the differences of high- and low-level networking in "
"Godot as well as some fundamentals. If you want to jump in head-first and "
"add networking to your first nodes, skip to `Initializing the network`_ "
"below. But make sure to read the rest later on!"

"以下為 Godot 中高階與低階網路的區別，以及一些基礎說明。若想直接將網路加到第一"

"Godot always supported standard low-level networking via UDP, TCP and some "
"higher level protocols such as SSL and HTTP. These protocols are flexible "
"and can be used for almost anything. However, using them to synchronize game "
"state manually can be a large amount of work. Sometimes that work can't be "
"avoided or is worth it, for example when working with a custom server "
"implementation on the backend. But in most cases, it's worthwhile to "
"consider Godot's high-level networking API, which sacrifices some of the "
"fine-grained control of low-level networking for greater ease of use."
msgstr ""
"Godot 使用 UDP、TCP、與其他如 SSL 與 HTTP 等的高級通訊協定來支援標準低階網"
"路。這些通訊協定非常彈性，且幾乎可以用在任何地方。但是，要手動通過這些方法來"
"同步遊戲狀態可能會需要大量的工作。有時候，這種工作是無法避免的，例如要處理後"
"端的自定伺服器實作時。但大多數情況下，都建議考慮一下 Godot 的高階網路 API，使"
"用高階網路 API 只需要犧牲小部分的細節控制，就可以換來更好的易用性。"

msgid "This is due to the inherent limitations of the low-level protocols:"
msgstr "由於繼承了低階通訊協定的一些特性，因此："

msgid ""
"TCP ensures packets will always arrive reliably and in order, but latency is "
"generally higher due to error correction. It's also quite a complex protocol "
"because it understands what a \"connection\" is, and optimizes for goals "
"that often don't suit applications like multiplayer games. Packets are "
"buffered to be sent in larger batches, trading less per-packet overhead for "
"higher latency. This can be useful for things like HTTP, but generally not "
"for games. Some of this can be configured and disabled (e.g. by disabling "
"\"Nagle's algorithm\" for the TCP connection)."
msgstr ""
"TCP確保封包始終可靠且按順序到達，但是由於錯誤校正，延遲通常更高。這也是一個非"
"常複雜的協定，因為它了解什麼是“連接”，並最佳化了通常不適合用於多人遊戲的應用"
"程序。封包被緩衝成更大的批次發送，從而減少了每份封包的開銷，提高了延遲。這對"
"HTTP之類的東西可能很有用，但對遊戲通常不是。其中一些可以配置和禁用（例如禁用"
"TCP連接的Nagle演算法）。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"UDP is a simpler protocol, which only sends packets (and has no concept of a "
"\"connection\"). No error correction makes it pretty quick (low latency), "
"but packets may be lost along the way or received in the wrong order. Added "
"to that, the MTU (maximum packet size) for UDP is generally low (only a few "
"hundred bytes), so transmitting larger packets means splitting them, "
"reorganizing them and retrying if a part fails."
msgstr ""
"UDP是一種更簡單的協定，它僅發送封包（並且沒有“連接”的概念）。沒有錯誤糾正可以"
"使其快速（低延遲），但是可能會丟失封包或以錯誤的順序接收封包。除此之外，UDP的"
"MTU（最大封包大小）通常很低（只有幾百個位元組），因此傳輸較大的封包意味著得將"
"其拆分、重組並在出現故障時重試。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"In general, TCP can be thought of as reliable, ordered, and slow; UDP as "
"unreliable, unordered and fast. Because of the large difference in "
"performance, it often makes sense to re-build the parts of TCP wanted for "
"games (optional reliability and packet order), while avoiding the unwanted "
"parts (congestion/traffic control features, Nagle's algorithm, etc). Due to "
"this, most game engines come with such an implementation, and Godot is no "
"exception."
msgstr ""
"普遍來說，TCP可以被認為是可靠，有序且緩慢；UDP不可靠，無序且快速。由於性能上"
"的巨大差異，重新構建遊戲所需的TCP部分（可選的可靠性和封包順序），同時免去不必"
"要的部分（擁塞/流量控制功能，Nagle演算法等）是合理的。因此，大多數遊戲引擎都"
"提供了這樣的實現方式，Godot也不例外。"

msgid ""
"In summary, you can use the low-level networking API for maximum control and "
"implement everything on top of bare network protocols or use the high-level "
"API based on :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` that does most of the heavy "
"lifting behind the scenes in a generally optimized way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most of Godot's supported platforms offer all or most of the mentioned high- "
"and low-level networking features. As networking is always largely hardware "
"and operating system dependent, however, some features may change or not be "
"available on some target platforms. Most notably, the HTML5 platform "
"currently only offers WebSocket support and lacks some of the higher level "
"features as well as raw access to low-level protocols like TCP and UDP."

msgid ""
"Adding networking to your game comes with some responsibility. It can make "
"your application vulnerable if done wrong and may lead to cheats or "
"exploits. It may even allow an attacker to compromise the machines your "
"application runs on and use your servers to send spam, attack others or "
"steal your users data if they play your game."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is always the case when networking is involved and has nothing to do "
"with Godot. You can of course experiment, but when you release a networked "
"application, always take care of any possible security concerns."

msgid "Mid level abstraction"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before going into how we would like to synchronize a game across the "
"network, it can be helpful to understand how the base network API for "
"synchronization works."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot uses a mid-level object :ref:`NetworkedMultiplayerPeer "
"<class_NetworkedMultiplayerPeer>`. This object is not meant to be created "
"directly, but is designed so that several C++ implementations can provide it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This object extends from :ref:`PacketPeer <class_PacketPeer>`, so it "
"inherits all the useful methods for serializing, sending and receiving data. "
"On top of that, it adds methods to set a peer, transfer mode, etc. It also "
"includes signals that will let you know when peers connect or disconnect."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class interface can abstract most types of network layers, topologies "
"and libraries. By default, Godot provides an implementation based on ENet (:"
"ref:`NetworkedMultiplayerEnet <class_NetworkedMultiplayerENet>`), one based "
"on WebRTC (:ref:`WebRTCMultiplayer <class_WebRTCMultiplayer>`), and one "
"based on WebSocket (:ref:`WebSocketMultiplayerPeer "
"<class_WebSocketMultiplayerPeer>`), but this could be used to implement "
"mobile APIs (for ad hoc WiFi, Bluetooth) or custom device/console-specific "
"networking APIs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For most common cases, using this object directly is discouraged, as Godot "
"provides even higher level networking facilities. Yet it is made available "
"in case a game has specific needs for a lower level API."

msgid "Initializing the network"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object that controls networking in Godot is the same one that controls "
"everything tree-related: :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To initialize high-level networking, the SceneTree must be provided a "
"NetworkedMultiplayerPeer object."
msgstr ""

"When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the ``INTERNET`` permission "
"in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click "
"deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by "
"Android."
msgstr ""

msgid "Managing connections"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some games accept connections at any time, others during the lobby phase. "
"Godot can be requested to no longer accept connections at any point (see "
"``set_refuse_new_network_connections(bool)`` and related methods on :ref:"
"`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>`). To manage who connects, Godot provides the "
"following signals in SceneTree:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Server and Clients:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``network_peer_connected(int id)``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``network_peer_disconnected(int id)``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above signals are called on every peer connected to the server "
"(including on the server) when a new peer connects or disconnects. Clients "
"will connect with a unique ID greater than 1, while network peer ID 1 is "
"always the server. Anything below 1 should be handled as invalid. You can "
"retrieve the ID for the local system via :ref:`SceneTree."
"get_network_unique_id() <class_SceneTree_method_get_network_unique_id>`. "
"These IDs will be useful mostly for lobby management and should generally be "
"stored, as they identify connected peers and thus players. You can also use "
"IDs to send messages only to certain peers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Clients:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``connected_to_server``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``connection_failed``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``server_disconnected``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Again, all these functions are mainly useful for lobby management or for "
"adding/removing players on the fly. For these tasks, the server clearly has "
"to work as a server and you have to perform tasks manually such as sending a "
"newly connected player information about other already connected players (e."
"g. their names, stats, etc)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Lobbies can be implemented any way you want, but the most common way is to "
"use a node with the same name across scenes in all peers. Generally, an "
"autoloaded node/singleton is a great fit for this, to always have access to, "
"e.g. \"/root/lobby\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "RPC"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To communicate between peers, the easiest way is to use RPCs (remote "
"procedure calls). This is implemented as a set of functions in :ref:`Node "
"<class_Node>`:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``rpc(\"function_name\", <optional_args>)``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``rpc_id(<peer_id>,\"function_name\", <optional_args>)``"

msgid "``rset_unreliable(\"variable\", value)``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``rset_unreliable_id(<peer_id>, \"variable\", value)``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Functions can be called in two fashions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Reliable: the function call will arrive no matter what, but may take longer "
"because it will be re-transmitted in case of failure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unreliable: if the function call does not arrive, it will not be re-"
"transmitted; but if it arrives, it will do it quickly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases, reliable is desired. Unreliable is mostly useful when "
"synchronizing object positions (sync must happen constantly, and if a packet "
"is lost, it's not that bad because a new one will eventually arrive and it "
"would likely be outdated because the object moved further in the meantime, "
"even if it was resent reliably)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is also the ``get_rpc_sender_id`` function in ``SceneTree``, which can "
"be used to check which peer (or peer ID) sent an RPC."
msgstr ""

msgid "Back to lobby"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's get back to the lobby. Imagine that each player that connects to the "
"server will tell everyone about it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You might have already noticed something different, which is the usage of "
"the ``remote`` keyword on the ``register_player`` function:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This keyword has two main uses. The first is to let Godot know that this "
"function can be called from RPC. If no keywords are added, Godot will block "
"any attempts to call functions for security. This makes security work a lot "
"easier (so a client can't call a function to delete a file on another "
"client's system)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second use is to specify how the function will be called via RPC. There "
"are four different keywords:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``remote``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``remotesync``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``master``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``puppet``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``remote`` keyword means that the ``rpc()`` call will go via network and "
"execute remotely."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``remotesync`` keyword means that the ``rpc()`` call will go via network "
"and execute remotely, but will also execute locally (do a normal function "
"call)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The others will be explained further down. Note that you could also use the "
"``get_rpc_sender_id`` function on ``SceneTree`` to check which peer actually "
"made the RPC call to ``register_player``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With this, lobby management should be more or less explained. Once you have "
"your game going, you will most likely want to add some extra security to "
"make sure clients don't do anything funny (just validate the info they send "
"from time to time, or before game start). For the sake of simplicity and "
"because each game will share different information, this is not shown here."
msgstr ""

msgid "Starting the game"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once enough players have gathered in the lobby, the server should probably "
"start the game. This is nothing special in itself, but we'll explain a few "
"nice tricks that can be done at this point to make your life much easier."
msgstr ""

msgid "Player scenes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most games, each player will likely have its own scene. Remember that "
"this is a multiplayer game, so in every peer you need to instance **one "
"scene for each player connected to it**. For a 4 player game, each peer "
"needs to instance 4 player nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So, how to name such nodes? In Godot, nodes need to have a unique name. It "
"must also be relatively easy for a player to tell which node represents each "
"player ID."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The solution is to simply name the *root nodes of the instanced player "
"scenes as their network ID*. This way, they will be the same in every peer "
"and RPC will work great! Here is an example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Depending on when you execute pre_configure_game(), you may need to change "
"any calls to ``add_child()`` to be deferred via ``call_deferred()``, as the "
"SceneTree is locked while the scene is being created (e.g. when ``_ready()`` "
"is being called)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Synchronizing game start"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting up players might take different amounts of time for every peer due "
"to lag, different hardware, or other reasons. To make sure the game will "
"actually start when everyone is ready, pausing the game until all players "
"are ready can be useful:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the server gets the OK from all the peers, it can tell them to start, "
"as for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Synchronizing the game"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most games, the goal of multiplayer networking is that the game runs "
"synchronized on all the peers playing it. Besides supplying an RPC and "
"remote member variable set implementation, Godot adds the concept of network "
"masters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Network master"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The network master of a node is the peer that has the ultimate authority "
"over it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When not explicitly set, the network master is inherited from the parent "
"node, which if not changed, is always going to be the server (ID 1). Thus "
"the server has authority over all nodes by default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The network master can be set with the function :ref:`Node."
"set_network_master(id, recursive) <class_Node_method_set_network_master>` "
"(recursive is ``true`` by default and means the network master is "
"recursively set on all child nodes of the node as well)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Checking that a specific node instance on a peer is the network master for "
"this node for all connected peers is done by calling :ref:`Node."
"is_network_master() <class_Node_method_is_network_master>`. This will return "
"``true`` when executed on the server and ``false`` on all client peers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have paid attention to the previous example, it's possible you "
"noticed that each peer was set to have network master authority for their "
"own player (Node) instead of the server:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each time this piece of code is executed on each peer, the peer makes itself "
"master on the node it controls, and all other nodes remain as puppets with "
"the server being their network master."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To clarify, here is an example of how this looks in the `bomber demo "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/networking/"
"multiplayer_bomber>`_:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Master and puppet keywords"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The real advantage of this model is when used with the ``master``/``puppet`` "
"keywords in GDScript (or their equivalent in C# and Visual Script). "
"Similarly to the ``remote`` keyword, functions can also be tagged with them:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Example bomb code:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Example player code:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the above example, a bomb explodes somewhere (likely managed by whoever "
"is the master of this bomb-node, e.g. the host). The bomb knows the bodies "
"(player nodes) in the area, so it checks that they contain an ``exploded`` "
"method before calling it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Recall that each peer has a complete set of instances of player nodes, one "
"instance for each peer (including itself and the host). Each peer has set "
"itself as the master of the instance corresponding to itself, and it has set "
"a different peer as the master for each of the other instances."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now, going back to the call to the ``exploded`` method, the bomb on the host "
"has called it remotely on all bodies in the area that have the method. "
"However, this method is in a player node and has a ``master`` keyword."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``master`` keyword on the ``exploded`` method in the player node means "
"two things for how this call is made. Firstly, from the perspective of the "
"calling peer (the host), the calling peer will only attempt to remotely call "
"the method on the peer that it has set as the network master of the player "
"node in question. Secondly, from the perspective of the peer the host is "
"sending the call to, the peer will only accept the call if it set itself as "
"the network master of the player node with the method being called (which "
"has the ``master`` keyword). This works well as long as all peers agree on "
"who is the master of what."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above setup means that only the peer who owns the affected body will be "
"responsible for telling all the other peers that its body was stunned, after "
"being remotely instructed to do so by the host's bomb. The owning peer "
"therefore (still in the ``exploded`` method) tells all the other peers that "
"its player node was stunned. The peer does this by remotely calling the "
"``stun`` method on all instances of that player node (on the other peers). "
"Because the ``stun`` method has the ``puppet`` keyword, only peers who did "
"not set themselves as the network master of the node will call it (in other "
"words, those peers are set as puppets for that node by virtue of not being "
"the network master of it)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The result of this call to ``stun`` is to make the player look stunned on "
"the screen of all the peers, including the current network master peer (due "
"to the local call to ``stun`` after ``rpc(\"stun\")``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The master of the bomb (the host) repeats the above steps for each of the "
"bodies in the area, such that all the instances of any player in the bomb "
"area get stunned on the screens of all the peers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that you could also send the ``stun()`` message only to a specific "
"player by using ``rpc_id(<id>, \"exploded\", bomb_owner)``. This may not "
"make much sense for an area-of-effect case like the bomb, but might in other "
"cases, like single target damage."

"Once you've made a multiplayer game, you may want to export it to run it on "
"a dedicated server with no GPU available. See :ref:"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The code samples on this page aren't designed to run on a dedicated server. "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The bomberman example here is largely for illustrational purposes, and does "
"not do anything on the host-side to handle the case where a peer uses a "
"custom client to cheat by for example refusing to stun itself. In the "
"current implementation such cheating is perfectly possible because each "
