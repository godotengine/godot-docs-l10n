msgid ""
"The WebSocket protocol was standardized in 2011 with the original goal of "
"allowing browsers to create stable and bidirectional connections with a "
"server. Before that, browsers used to only support HTTPRequests, which is "
"not well-suited for bidirectional communication."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The protocol is quite simple, message based, and a very powerful tool to "
"send push notifications to browsers, and has been used to implement chats, "
"turn-based games, etc. It still uses a TCP connection, which is good for "
"reliability but not for latency, so not good for real-time applications like "
"VoIP and fast-paced games (see :ref:`WebRTC <doc_webrtc>` for those use "
"cases)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to its simplicity, its wide compatibility, and being easier to use than "
"a raw TCP connection, WebSocket soon started to spread outside the browsers, "
"in native applications as a mean to communicate with network servers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Godot supports WebSocket in both native and HTML5 exports."

msgid "Using WebSocket in Godot"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"WebSocket is implemented in Godot via three main classes :ref:"
"`WebSocketClient <class_WebSocketClient>`, :ref:`WebSocketServer "
"<class_WebSocketServer>`, and :ref:`WebSocketPeer <class_WebSocketPeer>`. "
"The WebSocket implementation is compatible with the High Level Multiplayer. "
"See section on :ref:`high-level multiplayer <doc_high_level_multiplayer>` "
"for more details."

"When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the ``INTERNET`` permission "
"in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click "
"deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by "
"Android."

msgid "Minimal client example"

"This example will show you how to create a WebSocket connection to a remote "
"server, and how to send and receive data."

msgid "Minimal server example"

msgid ""
"This example will show you how to create a WebSocket server that listens for "
"remote connections, and how to send and receive data."

msgid "Advanced chat demo"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A more advanced chat demo which optionally uses the multiplayer mid-level "
"abstraction and a high level multiplayer demo are available in the `godot "
"demo projects <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects>`_ under "
"`networking/websocket_chat` and `networking/websocket_multiplayer`."
