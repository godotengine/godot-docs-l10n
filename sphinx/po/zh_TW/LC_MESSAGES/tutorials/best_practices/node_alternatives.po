msgid "When and how to avoid using nodes for everything"
msgstr "何時以及如何避免為任何事情使用節點"

msgid ""
"Nodes are cheap to produce, but even they have their limits. A project may "
"have tens of thousands of nodes all doing things. The more complex their "
"behavior though, the larger the strain each one adds to a project's "
"performance."
msgstr ""
"建立節點成本低，但建立節點有其限制。一個專案中可能有數以千計的節點，各司其"
"職。當這些節點的行為越複雜，每個節點對專案效能造成的壓力就越大。"

msgid ""
"Godot provides more lightweight objects for creating APIs which nodes use. "
"Be sure to keep these in mind as options when designing how you wish to "
"build your project's features."
msgstr ""
"Godot 有一些更輕量的物件，這些物件可以用來建立 API，並讓節點使用。在設計如何"
"製作專案功能時，請務必記得有這個選項。"

msgid ""
":ref:`Object <class_Object>`: The ultimate lightweight object, the original "
"Object must use manual memory management. With that said, it isn't too "
"difficult to create one's own custom data structures, even node structures, "
"that are also lighter than the :ref:`Node <class_Node>` class."
msgstr ""
":ref:`Object <class_Object>` ：終極輕量物件，原始的 Object。必須要使用手動記"
"憶體管理。也就是說，要建立自己的自定資料結構甚至節點結構並不困難，而且也比 :"
"ref:`Node <class_Node>` 還要輕量。"

msgid ""
"**Example:** See the :ref:`Tree <class_Tree>` node. It supports a high level "
"of customization for a table of content with an arbitrary number of rows and "
"columns. The data that it uses to generate its visualization though is "
"actually a tree of :ref:`TreeItem <class_TreeItem>` Objects."
msgstr ""
"**範例：** 請參考 :ref:`Tree<class_Tree>` 節點。該節點可為有任意行列的目錄進"
"行高度客製化。用來產生視覺化的資料實際上是通過一個樹狀 :ref:`TreeItem "
"<class_TreeItem>` 物件。"

msgid ""
"**Advantages:** Simplifying one's API to smaller scoped objects helps "
"improve its accessibility and improve iteration time. Rather than working "
"with the entire Node library, one creates an abbreviated set of Objects from "
"which a node can generate and manage the appropriate sub-nodes."
msgstr ""
"**優點：** 簡化 API 至更小作用域的物件有助於提升存取性，並改進迭代時間。比起"
"使用整個 Node 函式庫，不如用一組簡短的 Object 來建立子節點，讓節點可產生與管"
"理適當的子節點。"

msgid ""
"One should be careful when handling them. One can store an Object into a "
"variable, but these references can become invalid without warning. For "
"example, if the object's creator decides to delete it out of nowhere, this "
"would trigger an error state when one next accesses it."
msgstr ""
"在處理這些節點時要注意。我們可以將 Object 存到變數中，但這個參照可能會在沒有"
"警告的情況下失效。舉例來說，若物件的建立者刪除了物件，則下次存取物件的時候便"
"會觸發警告。"

msgid ""
":ref:`RefCounted <class_RefCounted>`: Only a little more complex than "
"Object. They track references to themselves, only deleting loaded memory "
"when no further references to themselves exist. These are useful in the "
"majority of cases where one needs data in a custom class."
msgstr ""
":ref:`Reference <class_Reference>` ：只稍微比 Object 複雜一點。Reference 會追"
"蹤自己的參照，然後只在沒有任何參照到自己時才刪除載入的記憶體。這種類別適用於"
"大多數自定類別中需要資料的情況。"

msgid ""
"**Example:** See the :ref:`FileAccess <class_FileAccess>` object. It "
"functions just like a regular Object except that one need not delete it "
"themselves."
msgstr ""
"**範例：** 請參考 :ref:`File <class_File>` 物件。該物件的功能除了不需要手動刪"
"除以外，就像一般的 Object 一樣。"

msgid "**Advantages:** same as the Object."
msgstr "**優點：** 與 Object 一樣。"

msgid ""
":ref:`Resource <class_Resource>`: Only slightly more complex than "
"RefCounted. They have the innate ability to serialize/deserialize (i.e. save "
"and load) their object properties to/from Godot resource files."
msgstr ""
":ref:`Resource <class_Resource>` ：只比 Reference 複雜一點。Resource 自帶將自"
"身物件屬性序列化到 Godot 資源檔案中，以及反過來從資源檔案中反序列化的能力 (即"
"保存與載入功能)。"

msgid ""
"**Example:** Scripts, PackedScene (for scene files), and other types like "
"each of the :ref:`AudioEffect <class_AudioEffect>` classes. Each of these "
"can be save and loaded, therefore they extend from Resource."
msgstr ""
"**範例：** Script, PackedScene (用於場景檔案) 與其他如各個 :ref:`AudioEffec "
"<class_AudioEffect>` 類別之類的型別。這些類別都可以載入與保存，因此都是從 "
"Resource 繼承來的。"

msgid ""
"**Advantages:** Much has :ref:`already been said <doc_resources>` on :ref:"
"`Resource <class_Resource>`'s advantages over traditional data storage "
"methods. In the context of using Resources over Nodes though, their main "
"advantage is in Inspector-compatibility. While nearly as lightweight as "
"Object/RefCounted, they can still display and export properties in the "
"Inspector. This allows them to fulfill a purpose much like sub-Nodes on the "
"usability front, but also improve performance if one plans to have many such "
"Resources/Nodes in their scenes."
msgstr ""
"**優點：** 關於 :ref:`Resource <class_Resource>` 比傳統資料儲存方法相比， :"
"ref:`已經討論過 <doc_resources>` 很多了。在使用 Resource 而不是 Node 的脈路"
"下，主要的優點就是與屬性面板的相容性。雖然輕量程度相當於 Object 與 "
"Reference，但 Resource 還可以在屬性面板中顯示與匯出屬性。這樣便可讓 Resource "
"在可用性方面來說填補子節點，也可於沒有在計劃場景中使用太多 Resource 與 Node "
"時提升效能。"
