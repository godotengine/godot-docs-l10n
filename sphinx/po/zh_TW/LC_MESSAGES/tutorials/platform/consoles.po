msgid "Console publishing process"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regardless of the engine used to create the game, the process to publish a "
"game to a console platform is as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Register a developer account on the console manufacturer's website, then "
"sign NDAs and publishing contracts. This requires you to have a registered "
"legal entity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. "
"This can take up to several months. Note that this step is significantly "
"easier if an established publisher is backing your game. Nintendo is "
"generally known to be more accepting of smaller developers, but this is not "
"guaranteed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Get access to developer tools and order a console specially made for "
"developers (*devkit*). The cost of those devkits is confidential."
msgstr ""

msgid "Port the engine to the console platform or pay a company to do it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To be published, your game needs to be rated in the regions you'd like to "
"sell it in. For example, in North America, the `ESRB <https://www.esrb.org/"
">`__ handles game ratings. In Europe, this is done by `PEGI <https://pegi."
"info/>`__. Indie developers can generally get a rating for cheaper compared "
"to more established developers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to the complexity of the process, the budget to publish a game by "
"yourself on a single console often exceeds $1,000 (this is a rough figure)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Official support"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot supports the Linux-based Steam Deck. The reason other consoles are not "
"officially supported are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To develop for consoles, one must be licensed as a company. As an open "
"source project, Godot does not have such a legal figure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Console SDKs are secret and covered by non-disclosure agreements. Even if we "
"could get access to them, we could not publish the platform-specific code "
"under an open source license."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consoles require specialized hardware to develop for, so regular individuals "
"can't create games for them anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, it is still possible to port your games to consoles thanks to "
"services provided by third-party companies."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine, except "
"that you need to contact a third-party developer to handle the porting "
"process. In other words, there is no engine that is legally allowed to "
"distribute console export templates without requiring the user to prove that "
"they are a licensed console developer. Doing so would violate the console "
"manufacturer's NDA."
msgstr ""

msgid "Third-party support"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Console ports of Godot are offered by third-party companies (which have "
"ported Godot on their own). These companies also offer publishing of your "
"games to various consoles."
msgstr ""

msgid "Following is the list of providers:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Lone Wolf Technology <http://www.lonewolftechnology.com/>`_ offers Switch "
"and PS4 porting and publishing of Godot games."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Pineapple Works <https://pineapple.works/>`_ offers Switch, Xbox One & Xbox "
"Series X/S (GDK) porting and publishing of Godot games (GDScript/C#)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`RAWRLAB games <https://www.rawrlab.com/>`_ offers Switch porting of Godot "
"games."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`mazette! games <https://mazette.games/>`_ offers Switch, Xbox One and Xbox "
"Series X/S porting and publishing of Godot games."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your company offers porting, or porting *and* publishing services for "
"Godot games, feel free to `open an issue or pull request <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot-docs>`_ to add your company to the list above."
