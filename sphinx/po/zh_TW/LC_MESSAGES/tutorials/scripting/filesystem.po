msgid "File system"
msgstr "檔案系統"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "簡介"

msgid ""
"A file system manages how assets are stored and how they are accessed. A "
"well-designed file system also allows multiple developers to edit the same "
"source files and assets while collaborating. Godot stores all assets as "
"files in its file system."
msgstr ""
"檔案系統控制了素材的保存與存取方式。設計得好的檔案系統也能讓多個開發者在協作"
"時編輯相同的原始檔與素材。Godot 會將所有的素材在自身檔案系統中保存為檔案。"

msgid "Implementation"
msgstr "實作"

msgid ""
"The file system stores resources on disk. Anything, from a script, to a "
"scene or a PNG image is a resource to the engine. If a resource contains "
"properties that reference other resources on disk, the paths to those "
"resources are also included. If a resource has sub-resources that are built-"
"in, the resource is saved in a single file together with all the bundled sub-"
"resources. For example, a font resource is often bundled together with the "
"font textures."
msgstr ""
"檔案系統會將資源保存在硬碟上。不論是腳本、場景、或 PNG 圖片等任何東西對於引擎"
"來說都是資源。若資源包含了參照硬碟上其他資源的屬性，則亦會包含該屬性的路徑。"
"若資源有內建子資源，則資源會與其他捆綁的子資源一併保存在單一檔案內。如，字體"
"資源通常會與字體紋理一起打包。"

msgid ""
"The Godot file system avoids using metadata files. Existing asset managers "
"and VCSs are better than anything we can implement, so Godot tries its best "
"to play along with SVN, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, etc."
msgstr ""
"Godot 檔案系統避免使用後設資料 (Metadata) 檔案。現存的素材管理員與版本控制系"
"統 (VCS) 比我們能做出來的東西好太多了，所以 Godot 就嘗試盡力配合 SVN、Git、"
"Mergurial、Perforce…等。"

msgid "Example of file system contents:"
msgstr "檔案系統的內容例："

msgid "project.godot"
msgstr "project.godot"

msgid ""
"The ``project.godot`` file is the project description file, and it is always "
"found at the root of the project. In fact, its location defines where the "
"root is. This is the first file that Godot looks for when opening a project."
msgstr ""
"``project.godot`` 檔案是專案的描述檔，且專案的根目錄上一定會有這個檔案。而事"
"實上，也是這個檔案定義了專案的根目錄位置。這個檔案是 Godot 在打開專案的時候第"
"一個會尋找的檔案。"

msgid ""
"This file contains the project configuration in plain text, using the win."
"ini format. Even an empty ``project.godot`` can function as a basic "
"definition of a blank project."
msgstr ""
"這個檔案包含了以純文字保存的專案組態設定，使用了 win.ini 格式。甚至，空白的 "
"``project.godot`` 檔也可以作為基本的空白專案定義來使用。"

msgid "Path delimiter"
msgstr "路徑分隔字元"

msgid ""
"Godot only supports ``/`` as a path delimiter. This is done for portability "
"reasons. All operating systems support this, even Windows, so a path such as "
"``C:\\project\\project.godot`` needs to be typed as ``C:/project/project."
"godot``."
msgstr ""
"Godot 只支援使用 ``/`` 來作為路徑分隔資源。這是為了可移植性而考量的。所有的作"
"業系統都支援使用 ``/`` ，甚至 Windows 也支援，所以如 ``C:\\project\\project."
"godot`` 必須要寫成 ``C:/project/project.godot`` 。"

msgid "Resource path"
msgstr "資源路徑"

msgid ""
"When accessing resources, using the host OS file system layout can be "
"cumbersome and non-portable. To solve this problem, the special path ``res://"
"`` was created."
msgstr ""
"存取資源時，若直接使用作業系統的檔案系統配置可能會很麻煩而且變得不可移植。為"
"了解決這個問題，我們製作了特別的路徑 ``res://`` 。"

msgid ""
"The path ``res://`` will always point at the project root (where ``project."
"godot`` is located, so ``res://project.godot`` is always valid)."
msgstr ""
"``res://`` 路徑會指向專案的根目錄（也就是 ``project.godot`` 的位置，所以 "
"``res://project.godot`` 這個路徑永遠有效）。"

msgid ""
"This file system is read-write only when running the project locally from "
"the editor. When exported or when running on different devices (such as "
"phones or consoles, or running from DVD), the file system will become read-"
"only and writing will no longer be permitted."
msgstr ""
"在編輯器中執行專案時檔案系統為可寫可讀模式。匯出或在不同的裝置上（如手機或平"
"台主機、或從 DVD 上執行）執行時，檔案系統會轉變為唯讀模式且無法再次寫入。"

msgid "User path"
msgstr "使用者路徑"

msgid ""
"Writing to disk is still needed for tasks such as saving game state or "
"downloading content packs. To this end, the engine ensures that there is a "
"special path ``user://`` that is always writable. This path resolves "
"differently depending on the OS the project is running on. Local path "
"resolution is further explained in :ref:`doc_data_paths`."
msgstr ""
"保存遊戲狀態或下載 DLC 時仍然需要將資料寫入硬碟。為了這個目的，引擎保留了一個"
"特殊的路徑 ``user://`` ，永遠可寫入。這個路徑會根據執行專案的作業系統的不同而"
"以不同的方式解析。有關本機路徑解析的更多資訊請參考 :ref:`doc_data_paths` 。"

msgid "Host file system"
msgstr "主機檔案系統"

msgid ""
"Alternatively host file system paths can also be used, but this is not "
"recommended for a released product as these paths are not guaranteed to work "
"on all platforms. However, using host file system paths can be useful when "
"writing development tools in Godot."
msgstr ""
"也可以使用主機檔案系統來替代，但並不建議在釋出正式版產品時使用。因為這些路徑"
"並不保證能在所有平台上正常運作。但使用主機檔案系統在 Godot 內撰寫開發工具時依"
"然很有用。"

msgid "Drawbacks"
msgstr "缺點"

msgid ""
"There are some drawbacks to this simple file system design. The first issue "
"is that moving assets around (renaming them or moving them from one path to "
"another inside the project) will break existing references to these assets. "
"These references will have to be re-defined to point at the new asset "
"location."
msgstr ""
"這種簡單的檔案系統設定還是有一些缺點的。第一個問題時移動素材（重新命名或在專"
"案中從一個路徑移到另一個路徑）會破壞這些素材現有的參照。這些參照必須重新定義"
"到新的素材路徑上。"

msgid ""
"To avoid this, do all your move, delete and rename operations from within "
"Godot, on the FileSystem dock. Never move assets from outside Godot, or "
"dependencies will have to be fixed manually (Godot detects this and helps "
"you fix them anyway, but why go the hard route?)."
msgstr ""
"為了解決這個問題，在移動、刪除、或是重新命名時，都應該從 Godot 的檔案系統 "
"Dock 內操作。請勿於 Godot 外部移動素材，否則相依性關係就必須手動修復（雖然 "
"Godot 會自動偵測到這些問題並協助你處理，但為什麼要特地選麻煩的方法呢？）。"

msgid ""
"The second is that, under Windows and macOS, file and path names are case "
"insensitive. If a developer working in a case insensitive host file system "
"saves an asset as ``myfile.PNG``, but then references it as ``myfile.png``, "
"it will work fine on their platform, but not on other platforms, such as "
"Linux, Android, etc. This may also apply to exported binaries, which use a "
"compressed package to store all files."
msgstr ""
"第二點則是，在 Windows 與 macOS 下，檔案與路徑名稱不區分大小寫。若開發者在不"
"區分大小寫的檔案系統下將素材保存為 ``myfile.PNG`` 但使用 ``myfile.png`` 來引"
"用，這樣可以在開發者的平台上正常運作，但其他平台則不能執行，如 Linux 或 "
"Android 等。這也包含了匯出為二進位檔案，會使用壓縮包來保存所有檔案。"

msgid ""
"It is recommended that your team clearly define a naming convention for "
"files when working with Godot. One simple fool-proof convention is to only "
"allow lowercase file and path names."
msgstr ""
"建議你的團隊在使用 Godot 時要明訂檔案命名規範。其中一種簡單暴力的命名規範就是"
"只允許在檔案與路徑名稱中使用小寫。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
