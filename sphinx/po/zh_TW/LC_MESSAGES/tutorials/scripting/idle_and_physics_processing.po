"Games run in a loop. Each frame, you need to update the state of your game "
"world before drawing it on screen. Godot provides two virtual methods in the "
"Node class to do so: :ref:`Node._process() <class_Node_method__process>` "
"and :ref:`Node._physics_process() <class_Node_method__physics_process>`. If "
"you define either or both in a script, the engine will call them "
"automatically."

msgid "There are two types of processing available to you:"
msgstr "Godot 中需要的圖示有兩種類型："

msgid ""
"**Idle processing** allows you to run code that updates a node every frame, "
"as often as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Physics processing** happens at a fixed rate, 60 times per second by "
"default. This is independent of your game's actual framerate, and keeps "
"physics running smoothly. You should use it for anything that involves the "
"physics engine, like moving a body that collides with the environment."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"You can activate idle processing by defining the ``_process()`` method in a "
"script. You can turn it off and back on by calling :ref:`Node.set_process() "
"<class_Node_method_set_process>`."
msgstr ""
"閒置處理會在腳本中有 :ref:`Node._process() <class_Node_method__process>`方法"
"時候啟動。可以通過 :ref:`Node.set_process() <class_Node_method_set_process>` "
"方法來開啟或關閉閒置處理。"

msgid "The engine calls this method every time it draws a frame:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that the frequency at which the engine calls ``_process()`` "
"depends on your application's framerate, which varies over time and across "
"devices."
msgstr ""
"有一點很重要的是， ``_process()`` 的呼叫頻率會依據應用程式在執行時的 FPS "
"(Frames Per Second，每秒幀數) 而定。這個頻率在不同設備下可能會不同。"

msgid ""
"The function's ``delta`` parameter is the time elapsed in seconds since the "
"previous call to ``_process()``. Use this parameter to make calculations "
"independent of the framerate. For example, you should always multiply a "
"speed value by ``delta`` to animate a moving object."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Physics processing works with a similar virtual function: "
"``_physics_process()``. Use it for calculations that must happen before each "
"physics step, like moving a character that collides with the game world. As "
"mentioned above, ``_physics_process()`` runs at fixed time intervals as much "
"as possible to keep the physics interactions stable. You can change the "
"interval between physics steps in the Project Settings, under Physics -> "
"Common -> Physics Fps. By default, it's set to run 60 times per second."
msgstr ""
"使用 ``_physics_process()`` 來進行物理處理，但物理處理是在每個物理步驟前使用"
"的，如控制角色。物理處理永遠都在物理步驟之前執行，而且會以相同的間隔呼叫，預"
"設為每秒 60 次。可以在專案設定中的 [Physics] -> [Common] -> [Physics FPS] 來"
"更改這個間隔。"

msgid ""
"The function ``_process()`` is not synchronized with physics. Its rate "
"depends on hardware and game optimization. It also runs after the physics "
"step in single-threaded games."
msgstr ""
"然而，``_process()`` 函式並不與物理處理同步。_process() 的幀率並不固定，且會"
"根據硬體與遊戲的最佳化而有所不同。在單一執行緒的遊戲上，_process() 會在物理步"
"驟後才被執行。"

msgid ""
"You can see the ``_process()`` function at work by creating a scene with a "
"single Label node, with the following script attached to it:"
msgstr ""
"有一個簡單的方法可以讓我們瞭解 ``_process()``。先建立一個有 Label 節點的場"
"景，然後使用下列腳本："

#, fuzzy
msgid "When you run the scene, you should see a counter increasing each frame."
msgstr "這樣就會顯示一個每一幀都會增加的計數器。"
