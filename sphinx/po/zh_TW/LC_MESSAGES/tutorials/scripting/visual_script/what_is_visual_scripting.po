msgid "What is Visual Scripting"
msgstr "什麼是視覺腳本"

msgid ""
"Visual Scripting is a tool designed to make the entry barrier to programming "
"much lower. As code is more visual, it needs less abstract thinking to be "
"understood. Any artist, animator, game designer, etc. can look at it and "
"quickly grasp the flow of logic."
msgstr ""
"視覺腳本是設計用來降低程式設計門檻的工具。因為程式碼變得視覺化，要理解程式碼"
"便不需太多的抽象思考。任何美術家、動畫家、遊戲設計師…等都可以看視覺腳本並快速"
"掌握邏輯流程。"

msgid ""
"The reason it does not make existing programming obsolete is, simply, that "
"it does not scale as well. It takes considerably more time to create code "
"with it, and it's often more difficult to modify than just writing a few "
"characters."
msgstr ""
"為什麼視覺腳本沒有取代現有的程式設計方法呢？很簡單，因為視覺化程式設計的延展"
"性並不好，要使用視覺腳本來寫程式也需要花費更多的時間，同時，要修改東西也遠比"
"改幾個字元來得困難。"

msgid ""
"With the misunderstanding cleared up, the question that remains is what are "
"the practical uses for Visual Scripting."
msgstr "既然解除了誤解，剩下的問題就是視覺腳本實際用途是什麼。"

msgid "The most common use cases are as follows:"
msgstr "常見的使用情景如下："

msgid ""
"Game development beginners who want to learn an engine but have no "
"programming experience yet."
msgstr "像學習遊戲引擎卻缺乏程式設計經驗的遊戲開發新手。"

msgid ""
"Artists and Game Designers who have no experience in programming and want to "
"create quick prototypes or simple games."
msgstr "沒有程式設計經驗但像建立快速原型或簡單遊戲的藝術家與遊戲設計師。"

msgid ""
"Programmers working in a team that want to make part of the game logic "
"available to Artists or Game Designers in order to offload some of their "
"work."
msgstr ""
"在團隊內工作，想把遊戲部分邏輯交給藝術家或遊戲設計師控制，進而減少自己工作量"
"的程式設計師。"

msgid ""
"These scenarios are far more common than one might think, so this is why "
"Godot has added this feature."
msgstr "這些情境比大家能想像的還要普遍，所以 Godot 才新增了視覺腳本功能。"
