msgid "Custom drawing in 2D"
msgstr ""

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "簡介"

msgid ""
"Godot has nodes to draw sprites, polygons, particles, and all sorts of "
"stuff. For most cases, this is enough; but not always. Before crying in "
"fear, angst, and rage because a node to draw that specific *something* does "
"not exist... it would be good to know that it is possible to easily make any "
"2D node (be it :ref:`Control <class_Control>` or :ref:`Node2D "
"<class_Node2D>` based) draw custom commands. It is *really* easy to do it, "
"too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Custom drawing in a 2D node is *really* useful. Here are some use cases:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Drawing shapes or logic that existing nodes can't do, such as an image with "
"trails or a special animated polygon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Visualizations that are not that compatible with nodes, such as a tetris "
"board. (The tetris example uses a custom draw function to draw the blocks.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Drawing a large number of simple objects. Custom drawing avoids the overhead "
"of using a large number of nodes, possibly lowering memory usage and "
"improving performance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Making a custom UI control. There are plenty of controls available, but when "
"you have unusual needs, you will likely need a custom control."
msgstr ""

msgid "Drawing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a script to any :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` derived node, like :"
"ref:`Control <class_Control>` or :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>`. Then override "
"the ``_draw()`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Draw commands are described in the :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` "
"class reference. There are plenty of them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Updating"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``_draw()`` function is only called once, and then the draw commands are "
"cached and remembered, so further calls are unnecessary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If re-drawing is required because a state or something else changed, call :"
"ref:`CanvasItem.update() <class_CanvasItem_method_update>` in that same node "
"and a new ``_draw()`` call will happen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is a little more complex example, a texture variable that will be "
"redrawn if modified:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In some cases, it may be desired to draw every frame. For this, just call "
"``update()`` from the ``_process()`` callback, like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "An example: drawing circular arcs"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We will now use the custom drawing functionality of the Godot Engine to draw "
"something that Godot doesn't provide functions for. As an example, Godot "
"provides a ``draw_circle()`` function that draws a whole circle. However, "
"what about drawing a portion of a circle? You will have to code a function "
"to perform this and draw it yourself."
msgstr ""

msgid "Arc function"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An arc is defined by its support circle parameters, that is, the center "
"position and the radius. The arc itself is then defined by the angle it "
"starts from and the angle at which it stops. These are the 4 arguments that "
"we have to provide to our drawing function. We'll also provide the color "
"value, so we can draw the arc in different colors if we wish."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Basically, drawing a shape on the screen requires it to be decomposed into a "
"certain number of points linked from one to the next. As you can imagine, "
"the more points your shape is made of, the smoother it will appear, but the "
"heavier it will also be in terms of processing cost. In general, if your "
"shape is huge (or in 3D, close to the camera), it will require more points "
"to be drawn without it being angular-looking. On the contrary, if your shape "
"is small (or in 3D, far from the camera), you may decrease its number of "
"points to save processing costs; this is known as *Level of Detail (LOD)*. "
"In our example, we will simply use a fixed number of points, no matter the "
"radius."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remember the number of points our shape has to be decomposed into? We fixed "
"this number in the ``nb_points`` variable to a value of ``32``. Then, we "
"initialize an empty ``PoolVector2Array``, which is simply an array of "
"``Vector2``\\ s."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The next step consists of computing the actual positions of these 32 points "
"that compose an arc. This is done in the first for-loop: we iterate over the "
"number of points for which we want to compute the positions, plus one to "
"include the last point. We first determine the angle of each point, between "
"the starting and ending angles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The reason why each angle is decreased by 90° is that we will compute 2D "
"positions out of each angle using trigonometry (you know, cosine and sine "
"stuff...). However, to be simple, ``cos()`` and ``sin()`` use radians, not "
"degrees. The angle of 0° (0 radian) starts at 3 o'clock, although we want to "
"start counting at 12 o'clock. So we decrease each angle by 90° in order to "
"start counting from 12 o'clock."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The actual position of a point located on a circle at angle ``angle`` (in "
"radians) is given by ``Vector2(cos(angle), sin(angle))``. Since ``cos()`` "
"and ``sin()`` return values between -1 and 1, the position is located on a "
"circle of radius 1. To have this position on our support circle, which has a "
"radius of ``radius``, we simply need to multiply the position by ``radius``. "
"Finally, we need to position our support circle at the ``center`` position, "
"which is performed by adding it to our ``Vector2`` value. Finally, we insert "
"the point in the ``PoolVector2Array`` which was previously defined."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now, we need to actually draw our points. As you can imagine, we will not "
"simply draw our 32 points: we need to draw everything that is between each "
"of them. We could have computed every point ourselves using the previous "
"method, and drew it one by one. But this is too complicated and inefficient "
"(except if explicitly needed), so we simply draw lines between each pair of "
"points. Unless the radius of our support circle is big, the length of each "
"line between a pair of points will never be long enough to see them. If that "
"were to happen, we would simply need to increase the number of points."
msgstr ""

msgid "Draw the arc on the screen"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We now have a function that draws stuff on the screen; it is time to call it "
"inside the ``_draw()`` function:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Result:"
msgstr "結果："

msgid "Arc polygon function"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can take this a step further and not only write a function that draws the "
"plain portion of the disc defined by the arc, but also its shape. The method "
"is exactly the same as before, except that we draw a polygon instead of "
"lines:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Dynamic custom drawing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All right, we are now able to draw custom stuff on the screen. However, it "
"is static; let's make this shape turn around the center. The solution to do "
"this is simply to change the angle_from and angle_to values over time. For "
"our example, we will simply increment them by 50. This increment value has "
"to remain constant or else the rotation speed will change accordingly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, we have to make both angle_from and angle_to variables global at the "
"top of our script. Also note that you can store them in other nodes and "
"access them using ``get_node()``."
msgstr ""

msgid "We make these values change in the _process(delta) function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We also increment our angle_from and angle_to values here. However, we must "
"not forget to ``wrap()`` the resulting values between 0 and 360°! That is, "
"if the angle is 361°, then it is actually 1°. If you don't wrap these "
"values, the script will work correctly, but the angle values will grow "
"bigger and bigger over time until they reach the maximum integer value Godot "
"can manage (``2^31 - 1``). When this happens, Godot may crash or produce "
"unexpected behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, we must not forget to call the ``update()`` function, which "
"automatically calls ``_draw()``. This way, you can control when you want to "
"refresh the frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, don't forget to modify the ``_draw()`` function to make use of these "
"variables:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's run! It works, but the arc is rotating insanely fast! What's wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The reason is that your GPU is actually displaying the frames as fast as it "
"can. We need to \"normalize\" the drawing by this speed; to achieve that, we "
"have to make use of the ``delta`` parameter of the ``_process()`` function. "
"``delta`` contains the time elapsed between the two last rendered frames. It "
"is generally small (about 0.0003 seconds, but this depends on your "
"hardware), so using ``delta`` to control your drawing ensures that your "
"program runs at the same speed on everybody's hardware."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our case, we simply need to multiply our ``rotation_angle`` variable by "
"``delta`` in the ``_process()`` function. This way, our 2 angles will be "
"increased by a much smaller value, which directly depends on the rendering "
"speed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's run again! This time, the rotation displays fine!"

msgid "Antialiased drawing"
msgstr "**抗鋸齒：**"

msgid ""
"Godot offers method parameters in :ref:"
"`draw_line<class_CanvasItem_method_draw_line>` to enable antialiasing, but "
"it doesn't work reliably in all situations (for instance, on mobile/web "
"platforms, or when HDR is enabled). There is also no ``antialiased`` "
"parameter available in :ref:"
"`draw_polygon<class_CanvasItem_method_draw_polygon>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a workaround, install and use the `Antialiased Line2D add-on <https://"
"github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-antialiased-line2d>`__ (which also "
"supports antialiased Polygon2D drawing). Note that this add-on relies on "
"high-level nodes, rather than low-level ``_draw()`` functions."
