"但該參照文件並不完整。還缺少某些方法、變數與訊號的說明。而最近某些新版本的改"

"To do so, you first need to compile Godot. See the :ref:"
"`doc_introduction_to_the_buildsystem` page to learn how. Then, execute the "

"The XML files in doc/classes should then be up-to-date with current Godot "
"Engine features. You can then check what changed using the ``git diff`` "
"command. Please only include changes that are relevant to your work on the "
"API in your commits. You can discard changes in other XML files using ``git "
"checkout``."

"接著，doc/classes 內的 XML 應該會更新為目前 Godot Engine 功能的版本。可以使"
"用 ``git diff`` 指令進行確認。如果改動包含了你目前計劃要編輯的說明文件以外的"
"類別，則請先將這些改動 Commit，然後再開始編輯樣板："
