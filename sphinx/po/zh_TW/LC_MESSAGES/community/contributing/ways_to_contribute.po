"Godot Engine is a non-profit, community-driven free and open source project. "
"Almost all (but our lead dev Juan, more on that below) developers are "
"working *pro bono* on their free time, out of personal interest and for the "
"love of creating a libre engine of exceptional quality."

"Godot Engine 是非盈利、由社群驅動、自由且開放原始碼的專案。幾乎所有 (除了開發"
"負責人 Juan，詳見下方) 開發人員都是利用空閒時間，抱持想製作高品質自由引擎的熱"
"情所 **無償** 開發的。"

msgid ""
"This means that to thrive, Godot needs as many users as possible to get "
"involved by contributing to the engine. There are many ways to contribute to "
"such a big project, making it possible for everybody to bring something "
"positive to the engine, regardless of their skill set:"
msgstr ""
"這表示，若 Godot 想成長茁壯，則需要儘量有多一點的人參與為 Godot 引擎貢獻。有"

"**Be part of the community.** The best way to contribute to Godot and help "
"it become ever better is simply to use the engine and promote it by word-of-"
"mouth, in the credits or splash screen of your games, blog posts, tutorials, "
"videos, demos, gamedev or free software events, support on the Q&A, forums, "
"Contributors Chat, Discord, etc. Participate! Being a user and advocate "
"helps spread the word about our great engine, which has no marketing budget "
"and can therefore only rely on its community to become more mainstream."
msgstr ""
"**成為社群的一部分。** 要參與貢獻 Godot，並讓 Godot 變得更好的最簡單的方法就"
"是親自使用 Godot 並到處宣傳，不論是在遊戲的製作人員名單內、部落格、教學、影"
"片、Demo 版遊戲、遊戲開發或自由軟體活動、支援與 Q&A、IRC、討論區、Discord …"
"等，一起參加就對了！由於 Godot 沒有行銷預算，幾乎都仰賴與社群來讓 Godot 擠進"
"主流市場，因此如果你能成為 Godot 的使用者與支持者將有助於讓 Godot 這個優秀的"
"遊戲引擎更佳流行。"

msgid ""
"**Make games.** It's no secret that, to convince new users and especially "
"the industry at large that Godot is a relevant market player, we need great "
"games made with Godot. We know that the engine has a lot of potential, both "
"for 2D and 3D games, but given its young age we still lack big releases that "
"will draw attention to Godot. So keep working on your awesome projects, each "
"new game increases our credibility on the gamedev market!"
msgstr ""
"**製作遊戲。** 大家都知道，在 Godot 所參與的這整個產業中，要說服新使用者的方"

"**Get involved in the engine's development.** This can be by contributing "
"code via pull requests, testing the development snapshots or directly the "
"git *master* branch, report bugs or suggest enhancements on the issue "

"tutorials) and its translations. The following sections will cover each of "

"**Donate.** Godot is a non-profit project, but it can still benefit from "
"user donations for many things. Apart from usual expenses such as hosting "
"costs or promotional material on events, we also use donation money to "
"acquire hardware when necessary (e.g. we used donation money to buy a "
"MacBook Pro to implement Retina/HiDPI support and various other macOS-"
"related features). Most importantly, we also used donation money to hire "
"core developers so they can work full-time on the engine. Even with a low "
"monthly wage, we need a steady donation income to continue doing this, which "
"has been very beneficial to the project so far. So if you want to donate "
"some money to the project, check `our website <https://godotengine.org/"
"donate>`_ for details."

"在需要的時候使用收到的捐款來購買硬體 (如，我們曾使用捐款買一台 MacBook Pro 來"
"實作 Retina/HiDPI 支援與其他 macOS 相關的功能)。最重要的是，我們也會使用收到"
