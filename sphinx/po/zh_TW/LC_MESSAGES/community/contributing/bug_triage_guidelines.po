"*Archived*: either a duplicate of another issue, or invalid. Such an issue "

"*Breaks compat*: describes something that can only be fixed by breaking "

"used for \"hard\" crashes, not freezes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Confirmed*: has been confirmed by at least one other contributor than the "
"bug reporter (typically for *Bug* reports). The purpose of this label is to "
"let developers know which issues are still reproducible when they want to "
"select what to work on. It is therefore a good practice to add in a comment "
"on what platform and what version or commit of Godot the issue could be "
"reproduced; if a developer looks at the issue one year later, the "
"*Confirmed* label may not be relevant anymore."
msgstr ""
"**Confirmed**: 已確認。由至少一位除了回報 Bug 的人以外的開發者確認 (通常用於 "
"**Bug** 回報)。設定該 Label 是要讓其他開發人員在要處理 Issue 時知道那些 "
"Issue 目前仍可重現。因此，在註解中寫上能復現該 Issue 的平台與 Godot 版本或 "
"Commit 是好習慣。當某個開發人員過了一年之後回來看這個 Issue，則 "
