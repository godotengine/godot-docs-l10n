"The procedure for this is somewhat complex and requires a lot of steps, but "
"once you have the environment properly configured it will be easy to compile "
"Godot for iOS anytime you want."

"While it is possible to compile for iOS on a Linux environment, Apple is "
"very restrictive about the tools to be used (especially hardware-wise), "
"allowing pretty much only their products to be used for development. So this "
"is **not official**. However, a `statement from Apple in 2010 <http://www."
"apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/09Statement-by-Apple-on-App-Store-Review-"
"Guidelines.html>`__ says they relaxed some of the `App Store review "
"guidelines <https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/>`__ to "
"allow any tool to be used, as long as the resulting binary does not download "
"any code, which means it should be OK to use the procedure described here "
"and cross-compiling the binary."

"`XCode with the iOS SDK <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download>`__ (a "
"dmg image)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Clang >= 3.5 <http://clang.llvm.org>`__ for your development machine "
"installed and in the ``PATH``. It has to be version >= 3.5 to target "
"``arm64`` architecture."

"`Fuse <https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse>`__ for mounting and umounting the "
"dmg image."

msgid ""
"`darling-dmg <https://github.com/darlinghq/darling-dmg>`__, which needs to "
"be built from source. The procedure for that is explained below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For building darling-dmg, you'll need the development packages of the "
"following libraries: fuse, icu, openssl, zlib, bzip2."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`cctools-port <https://github.com/tpoechtrager/cctools-port>`__ for the "
"needed build tools. The procedure for building is quite peculiar and is "
"described below."
msgstr ""

msgid "This also has some extra dependencies: automake, autogen, libtool."

"Copy the tools to a nicer place. Note that the SCons scripts for building "
"will look under ``usr/bin`` inside the directory you provide for the "
"toolchain binaries, so you must copy to such subdirectory, akin to the "
"following commands:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you should have the iOS toolchain binaries in ``/home/user/iostoolchain/"
"usr/bin``."

msgid "Compiling Godot for iPhone"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you've done the above steps, you should keep two things in your "
"environment: the built toolchain and the iPhoneOS SDK directory. Those can "
"stay anywhere you want since you have to provide their paths to the SCons "
"build command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the iPhone platform to be detected, you need the ``OSXCROSS_IOS`` "
"environment variable defined to anything."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you can compile for iPhone using SCons like the standard Godot way, with "
"some additional arguments to provide the correct paths:"

msgid "Producing fat binaries"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Apple requires a fat binary with both architectures (``armv7`` and "
"``arm64``) in a single file. To do this, use the ``arm-apple-darwin11-lipo`` "
"executable. The following example assumes you are in the root Godot source "
"directory:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then you will have iOS fat binaries in ``bin`` directory."
