"While it is possible to compile for iOS on a Linux environment, Apple is "
"very restrictive about the tools to be used (especially hardware-wise), "
"allowing pretty much only their products to be used for development. So this "
"is **not official**. However, a `statement from Apple in 2010 <http://www."
"apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/09Statement-by-Apple-on-App-Store-Review-"
"Guidelines.html>`__ says they relaxed some of the `App Store review "
"guidelines <https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/>`__ to "
"allow any tool to be used, as long as the resulting binary does not download "
"any code, which means it should be OK to use the procedure described here "
"and cross-compiling the binary."
