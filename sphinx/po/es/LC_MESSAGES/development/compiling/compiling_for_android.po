"In most cases, using the built-in deployer and export templates is good "

msgid "Building the export templates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot needs two export templates for Android: the optimized \"release\" "
"template (``android_release.apk``) and the debug template (``android_debug."
"apk``). As Google will require all APKs to include ARMv8 (64-bit) libraries "
"starting from August 2019, the commands below will build an APK containing "
"both ARMv7 and ARMv8 libraries."

"If you also want to include support for x86 and x86-64 devices, run the "
"SCons command a third and fourth time with the ``android_arch=x86``, and "
"``android_arch=x86_64`` arguments before building the APK with Gradle. For "
"example, for the release template:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will create a fat binary that works on all platforms. The final APK "
"size of exported projects will depend on the platforms you choose to support "
"when exporting; in other words, unused platforms will be removed from the "
"APK."

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Using the export templates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot needs release and debug APKs that were compiled against the same "
"version/commit as the editor. If you are using official binaries for the "
"editor, make sure to install the matching export templates, or build your "
"own from the same version."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When exporting your game, Godot opens the APK, changes a few things inside "
"and adds your files."
msgstr ""
"Al exportar tu juego, Godot abre el APK, cambia algunas cosas dentro y añade "
"tus archivos."

msgid "Installing the templates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The newly-compiled templates (``android_debug.apk`` and ``android_release."
"apk``) must be copied to Godot's templates folder with their respective "
"names. The templates folder can be located in:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Windows: ``%APPDATA%\\Godot\\templates\\<version>\\``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Linux: ``$HOME/.local/share/godot/templates/<version>/``"
msgstr ""

msgid "macOS: ``$HOME/Library/Application Support/Godot/templates/<version>/``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``<version>`` is of the form ``major.minor[.patch].status`` using values "
"from ``version.py`` in your Godot source repository (e.g. ``3.0.5.stable`` "
"or ``3.1.dev``). You also need to write this same version string to a "
"``version.txt`` file located next to your export templates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, if you are writing your custom modules or custom C++ code, you "
"might instead want to configure your APKs as custom export templates here:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You don't even need to copy them, you can just reference the resulting file "
"in the ``bin\\`` directory of your Godot source folder, so that the next "
"time you build you will automatically have the custom templates referenced."
msgstr ""

msgid "Troubleshooting"
msgstr "Solución De Problemas"

msgid "Platform doesn't appear in SCons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Double-check that you've set the ``ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`` environment variable. "

msgid ""
"Then check the output while the application is installed; the error message "
"should be presented there. Seek assistance if you can't figure it out."
msgstr ""

msgid "Application exits immediately"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the application runs but exits immediately, this might be due to one of "
"the following reasons:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure to use export templates that match your editor version; if you use "
"a new Godot version, you *have* to update the templates too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``libgodot_android.so`` is not in ``libs/<android_arch>/`` where "
"``<android_arch>`` is the device's architecture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The device's architecture does not match the exported one(s). Make sure your "
"templates were built for that device's architecture, and that the export "
"settings included support for that architecture."
