"If a game was always going to be run on the same device and at the same "
"resolution, positioning controls would be a simple matter of setting the "
"position and size of each one of them. Unfortunately, that is rarely the "
"case."

"Only TVs nowadays have a standard resolution and aspect ratio. Everything "
"else, from computer monitors to tablets, portable consoles and mobile phones "
"have different resolutions and aspect ratios."

"There are several ways to handle this, but for now, let's just imagine that "
"the screen resolution has changed and the controls need to be re-positioned. "
"Some will need to follow the bottom of the screen, others the top of the "
"screen, or maybe the right or left margins."

"This is done by editing the *margin* properties of controls. Each control "
"has four margins: left, right, bottom and top. By default, all of them "
"represent a distance in pixels relative to the top-left corner of the parent "
"control or (in case there is no parent control) the viewport."

msgid ""
"When horizontal (left,right) and/or vertical (top,bottom) anchors are "
"changed to 1, the margin values become relative to the bottom-right corner "
"of the parent control or viewport."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/gui/size_and_anchors.rst:35
msgid ""
"Here, the control is set to expand its bottom-right corner with that of the "
"parent, so when re-sizing the parent, the control will always cover it, "
"leaving a 20 pixel margin:"

msgid ""
"To center a control in its parent, set its anchors to 0.5 and each margin to "
"half of its relevant dimension. For example, the code below shows how a "
"TextureRect can be centered in its parent:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/gui/size_and_anchors.rst:63
msgid ""
"Setting each anchor to 0.5 moves the reference point for the margins to the "
"center of its parent. From there, we set negative margins so that the "
"control gets its natural size."
