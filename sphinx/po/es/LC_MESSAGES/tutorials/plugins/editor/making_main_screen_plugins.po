"As seen in the :ref:`doc_making_plugins` page, making a basic plugin that "
"extends the editor is fairly easy. Main screen plugins allow you to create "
"new UIs in the central part of the editor, which appear next to the \"2D\", "
"\"3D\", \"Script\", and \"AssetLib\" buttons. Such editor plugins are "
"referred as \"Main screen plugins\"."

"The plugin script will come with ``_enter_tree()`` and ``_exit_tree()`` "

"Add five extra methods such that the script looks like this:"

"The important part in this script is the ``has_main_screen()`` function, "
"which is overloaded so it returns ``true``. This function is automatically "
"called by the editor on plugin activation, to tell it that this plugin adds "
"a new center view to the editor. For now, we'll leave this script as-is and "
"we'll come back to it later."

"The ``_enter_tree()`` function is called before ``_ready()``. This is where "
