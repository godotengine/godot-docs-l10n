"If you are just starting out with either Godot or game development in "

"Note that C# support is still relatively new, and as such, you may encounter "

"Searching through discussions on `open issues <https://github.com/"

"is a great way to start your troubleshooting."

msgid ""
"GDScript is Godot's integrated scripting language. It was built from the "
"ground up to maximize Godot's potential in the least amount of code, "
"affording both novice and expert developers alike to capitalize on Godot's "
"strengths as fast as possible. If you've ever written anything in a language "
"like Python before, then you'll feel right at home. For examples and a "
"complete overview of the power GDScript offers you, check out the :ref:"

msgstr ""
"GDScript 是 Godot 所集成的脚本语言。它是从头开始构建的，目标是用最少的代码让 "

"你曾经用类似 Python 这样的语言写过任何东西，那么你会感到得心应手。如果你想了"
"解关于 GDScript 的示例以及完整的功能介绍，请查看 :ref:`GDScript 脚本指南 "
"<doc_gdscript>`\\ 。"

msgid ""
"There are several reasons to use GDScript, especially when you are "
"prototyping, in alpha/beta stages of your project, or are not creating the "
"next AAA title. The most salient reason is the overall **reduction of "
"complexity**."
msgstr ""
"使用 GDScript 有不少原因，尤其是你在进行原型设计时、在项目的 alpha/beta 阶"
"段、或者项目不是 3A 大作时。但最突出的优势就是整体\\ **复杂度降低**\\ 。"

msgid ""
"The original intent of creating a tightly integrated, custom scripting "
"language for Godot was two-fold: first, it reduces the amount of time "
"necessary to get up and running with Godot, giving developers a rapid way of "
"exposing themselves to the engine with a focus on productivity; second, it "
"reduces the overall burden of maintenance, attenuates the dimensionality of "
"issues, and allows the developers of the engine to focus on squashing bugs "
"and improving features related to the engine core, rather than spending a "
"lot of time trying to get a small set of incremental features working across "
"a large set of languages."
msgstr ""
"为 Godot 创建一个紧密集成的自定义脚本语言的初衷有两点：首先，它减少了启动和运"
"行Godot 所需的时间，使开发人员沉浸于引擎并专注生产力；其次，它减少了维护的总"
"体负担，降低了问题的维度，让引擎开发者专注于排除错误并改进与引擎核心相关的功"
"能，而不是花费大量时间试图在一大堆语言中获得一小部分增量功能。"

msgid ""
"Since Godot is an open source project, it was imperative from the start to "
"prioritize a more integrated and seamless experience over attracting "
"additional users by supporting more familiar programming languages, "
"especially when supporting those more familiar languages would result in a "
"worse experience. We understand if you would rather use another language in "
"Godot (see the list of supported options above). That being said, if you "
"haven't given GDScript a try, try it for **three days**. Just like Godot, "
"once you see how powerful it is and rapid your development becomes, we think "
"GDScript will grow on you."
msgstr ""
"由于 Godot 是开源项目，因此从一开始就必须优先考虑更加集成和无缝的体验，而不是"
"通过支持大多人熟悉的编程语言来吸引更多用户——特别是在支持那些大多人熟悉的语言"
"会导致更糟糕的体验时。我们理解你更想在 Godot 中使用其他语言（请参阅上面支持的"
"选项列表）。话虽如此，如果你还没试过 GDScript，先试\\ **三天**\\ 。就像 "
"Godot 一样，一旦你看到它有多强大并且开发多迅速，我们认为你将对 GDScript 刮目"

msgstr "创建 GDScript 背后的动机是什么？"

msgid ""
"In the early days, the engine used the `Lua <https://www.lua.org>`__ "
"scripting language. Lua can be fast thanks to LuaJIT, but creating bindings "
"to an object-oriented system (by using fallbacks) was complex and slow and "
"took an enormous amount of code. After some experiments with `Python "
"<https://www.python.org>`__, that also proved difficult to embed."
msgstr ""
"在早期，引擎使用 `Lua <https://www.lua.org>`__ 脚本语言。Lua 高性能来源于 "
"LuaJIT，但是创建与面向对象系统的绑定（通过使用回退）是非常复杂且缓慢的，并且"
"需要大量代码。在用 `Python <https://www.python.org>`__ 进行了一些实验后，它也"
"被证明是难以嵌入的。"

msgid ""
"The main reasons for creating a custom scripting language for Godot were:"
msgstr "为 Godot 创建自定义脚本语言的主要原因有："

msgid ""
"Poor threading support in most script VMs, and Godot uses threads (Lua, "
"Python, Squirrel, JavaScript, ActionScript, etc.)."
msgstr ""
"Godot 使用多线程，而大多数脚本虚拟机对线程的支持不佳（Lua、Python、Squirrel、"

"Godot works is highly inefficient (Lua, Python, JavaScript)."
msgstr ""
"大多数脚本语言（Lua、Python、JavaScript）的虚拟机没有很好地支持类扩展，适配 "
"Godot 工作方式的效率极低。"

msgid ""
"Many existing languages have horrible interfaces for binding to C++, "
"resulting in a large amount of code, bugs, bottlenecks, and general "
"inefficiency (Lua, Python, Squirrel, JavaScript, etc.). We wanted to focus "
"on a great engine, not a great number of integrations."
msgstr ""
"许多现有语言的 C++ 绑定接口都非常糟糕，会产生大量代码、错误、瓶颈，而且效率普"
"遍低下（例如 Lua、Python、Squirrel、JavaScript 等）。我们希望专注于一个更好的"
"引擎，而不是大量的缝合。"

msgid ""
"No native vector types (Vector3, Transform3D, etc.), resulting in highly "
"reduced performance when using custom types (Lua, Python, Squirrel, "
"JavaScript, ActionScript, etc.)."
msgstr ""
"没有原生的向量类型（Vector3、Transform3D 等），导致使用自定义类型实现时，性能"
"大大降低（Lua、Python、Squirrel、JavaScript、ActionScript 等）。"

msgid ""
"Garbage collector results in stalls or unnecessarily large memory usage "
"(Lua, Python, JavaScript, ActionScript, etc.)."
msgstr ""
"在大部分解释型编程语言（Lua、Python、JavaScript、ActionScript 等）中，垃圾收"

"The aim of Godot is to create a free and open source MIT-licensed engine "
