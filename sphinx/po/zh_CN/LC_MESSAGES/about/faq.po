"The original intent of creating a tightly integrated, custom scripting "
"language for Godot was two-fold: first, it reduces the amount of time "
"necessary to get up and running with Godot, giving developers a rapid way of "
"exposing themselves to the engine with a focus on productivity; second, it "
"reduces the overall burden of maintenance, attenuates the dimensionality of "
"issues, and allows the developers of the engine to focus on squashing bugs "

"**Code maintenance and surface for bugs.** Every time we accept new code in "

"**Keeping the binary size small for export templates.** This directly "
