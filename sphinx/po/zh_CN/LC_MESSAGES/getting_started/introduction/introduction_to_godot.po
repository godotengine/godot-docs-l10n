"This article is here to help you figure out whether Godot might be a good "
"fit for you. We will introduce some broad features of the engine to give you "
"a feel for what you can achieve with it and answer questions such as \"what "
"do I need to know to get started?\"."
msgstr ""
"本文可帮助你了解 Godot 是否适合你。我们将介绍该引擎的一些广泛的功能，让你感受"

"you use, though, releasing games on consoles is always a lot of work. You "
"can read more on that here: :ref:`doc_consoles`."
msgstr ""
"由于游戏主机制造商施加的许可条款，Godot 团队无法提供开源的主机导出项。但是，"
