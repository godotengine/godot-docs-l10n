"The game we'll code here is similar to :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game`, with a "
"twist: you can now jump and your goal is to squash the creeps. This way, you "

"**build upon them** with new code and features."
msgstr ""
"我们要编写的游戏和 :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game` 差不多，但是：你可以跳起来"

"This tutorial is for beginners who followed the complete getting started "

"You can follow this series without having done the 2D one. However, if "
"you're new to game development, we recommend you to start with 2D. 3D game "
"code is always more complex and the 2D series will give you foundations to "
"follow along more comfortably."
msgstr ""
"你可以在没有做过 2D 的情况下继续学习这个系列。但是，如果你是游戏开发新手，我"
"们建议你从 2D 开始。3D 游戏代码总是比较复杂，而 2D 系列会给你打下基础，让你更"

"We will first work on a basic prototype for the player's movement. We will "
"then add the monsters that we'll spawn randomly around the screen. After "
"that, we'll implement the jump and squashing mechanic before refining the "
"game with some nice animation. We'll wrap up with the score and the retry "
"screen."
msgstr ""
"我们将首先为玩家的移动制作一个基本的原型。然后，添加我们将在屏幕周围随机生成"
"的怪物。之后，我们将实现跳跃和压扁机制，然后用一些漂亮的动画来完善游戏。我们"
"将以分数和重玩屏幕结束。"
