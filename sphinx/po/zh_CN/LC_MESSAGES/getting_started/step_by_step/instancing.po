"In the previous part, we saw that a scene is a collection of nodes organized "
"in a tree structure, with a single node as its root. You can split your "
"project into any number of scenes. This feature helps you break down and "
"organize your game's different components."
msgstr ""
"上一部分中，我们了解到场景是一系列组织成树状结构的节点，其中只有一个节点是根"
"节点。你可以将项目拆分成任意数量的场景。这一特性可以帮你将游戏拆解成不同的组"

"You can create as many scenes as you'd like and save them as files with the "
"``.tscn`` extension, which stands for \"text scene\". The ``label.tscn`` "
"file from the previous lesson was an example. We call those files \"Packed "
"Scenes\" as they pack information about your scene's content."
msgstr ""
"你可以创建任意数量的场景并将他们保存成扩展名为 ``.tscn`` （“text scene” 文本"
"场景）的文件。上节课的 ``label.tscn`` 文件就是一个例子。我们把这些文件叫作“打"
"包的场景”（Packed Scene），因为它们将场景的内容信息进行了打包。"

msgid ""
"Here's an example of a ball. It's composed of a :ref:`RigidBody2D "
"<class_RigidBody2D>` node as its root named Ball, which allows the ball to "
"fall and bounce on walls, a :ref:`Sprite2D <class_Sprite2D>` node, and a :"
"ref:`CollisionShape2D <class_CollisionShape2D>`."
msgstr ""
"这有一个小球的例子。它由以下内容组成：一个叫“Ball”的 :ref:`RigidBody2D "
"<class_RigidBody2D>` 节点是根节点，可以让小球下落、在撞墙后反弹；一个 :ref:"
"`Sprite2D <class_Sprite2D>` 节点以及一个 :ref:`CollisionShape2D "
"<class_CollisionShape2D>`\\ 。"

msgid ""
"Once you saved a scene, it works as a blueprint: you can reproduce it in "
"other scenes as many times as you'd like. Replicating an object from a "
"template like this is called **instancing**."
msgstr ""
"保存场景过后，这个场景就可以作为蓝图使用：你可以在其他场景中进行任意数量的翻"
"制。将对象根据模板进行翻制的这一过程就叫作\\ **实例化**\\ 。"

msgid ""
"As we mentioned in the previous part, instanced scenes behave like a node: "
"the editor hides their content by default. When you instance the Ball, you "
"only see the Ball node. Notice also how each duplicate has a unique name."
msgstr ""
"我们在上一部分提到过，实例化场景的行为与节点类似：编辑器默认会隐藏其中的内"
"容。实例化 Ball 之后，你只会看到 Ball 节点。请注意制作出的副本，名字是唯一"
"的。"

msgid ""
"Every instance of the Ball scene starts with the same structure and "
"properties as ``ball.tscn``. However, you can modify each independently, "
"such as changing how they bounce, how heavy they are, or any property "
"exposed by the source scene."
msgstr ""
"Ball 场景的实例最开始都和 ``ball.tscn`` 有相同的结构和属性。不过你也可以单独"
"修改各个实例，比如修改反弹的方式、重量等源场景所暴露的属性。"

msgid "In practice"
msgstr "实践"

"Let's add a ball as a child of the Main node. In the Scene dock, select the "

msgstr ""
"让我们为 Main 节点添加一个小球作为子节点。在“场景”面板中，选择 Main 节点。然"

"Play the game by pressing :kbd:`F5` (:kbd:`Cmd + B` on macOS) and notice how "

"You may notice you are unable to change the values of the "
"``PhysicsMaterial`` of the ball. This is because ``PhysicsMaterial`` is a "
"resource, and needs to be made unique before you can edit it in a scene that "
"is linking to its original scene. To make a resource unique for one "
"instance, right-click on it in the Inspector and click Make Unique in the "
"contextual menu."
msgstr ""
"如果你修改了一个实例中的 ``PhysicsMaterial``\\ ，那么就会影响到其他所有实例。"
"这是因为 ``PhysicsMaterial`` 是一个资源，而资源是跨实例共享的。要让某个实例的"

msgid "Scene instances as a design language"

msgid ""
"Instances and scenes in Godot offer an excellent design language, setting "

"concept from the ground up."
msgstr ""
"Godot中的实例和场景提供了一种优秀的设计语言，使该引擎与其他引擎不同。我们从一"
"开始就围绕这个概念设计Godot。"

msgid ""
"We recommend dismissing architectural code patterns when making games with "
"Godot, such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Entity-Relationship diagrams. "
"Instead, you can start by imagining the elements players will see in your "
"game and structure your code around them."
msgstr ""
"我们建议在使用 Godot 制作游戏时忽略架构代码模式，例如模型-视图-控制器 "
"（MVC） 或实体关系图。相反，你可以从想象玩家将在游戏中看到的元素开始，并围绕"
"它们构建代码。"

msgid "For example, you could break down a shooter game like so:"
msgstr "例如，你可以这样拆解一个射击游戏："

msgid ""
"You can come up with a diagram like this for almost any type of game. Each "
"rectangle represents an entity that's visible in the game from the player's "
"perspective. The arrows tell you which scene owns which."
msgstr ""
"对于几乎任何类型的游戏，都可以想出这样的图表。矩形表示的是从玩家角度可以在游"
"戏中看到的实体，箭头表示的是场景之间的从属关系。"

msgid ""
"Once you have a diagram, we recommend creating a scene for each element "
"listed in it to develop your game. You'll use instancing, either by code or "
"directly in the editor, to build your tree of scenes."
msgstr ""
"在得到这样的图之后，建议你为其中的每一个元素都创建一个场景。你可以通过代码或"
"者直接在编辑器里将其实例化来构建你的场景树。"

msgid ""
"Programmers tend to spend a lot of time designing abstract architectures and "
"trying to fit components into it. Designing based on scenes makes "
"development faster and more straightforward, allowing you to focus on the "
"game logic itself. Because most game components map directly to a scene, "
"using a design based on scene instantiation means you need little other "
"architectural code."
msgstr ""
"程序员们乐于花费大量时间来设计抽象的架构，尽力使得组件能够适用于这个架构。基"
"于场景的设计取代了这种方法，使得开发更快、更直接，能够让你去专注于游戏逻辑本"
"身。因为大多数游戏的组件都是直接映射成一个场景，所以使用基于场景实例化的设计"
"意味着需要很少的其他架构代码。"

msgid ""
"Here's the example of a scene diagram for an open-world game with tons of "
"assets and nested elements:"
msgstr ""
"这里是另一个更复杂的开放世界类游戏的示例，这个示例包括有很多资产和嵌套元素："

msgid ""
"Imagine we started by creating the room. We could make a couple of different "
"room scenes, with unique arrangements of furniture in them. Later, we could "
"make a house scene that uses multiple room instances for the interior. We "
"would create a citadel out of many instanced houses and a large terrain on "
"which we would place the citadel. Each of these would be a scene instancing "
"one or more sub-scenes."
msgstr ""
"想象一下，我们从创建房间开始。我们可以制作几个不同的房间场景，在其中有独特的"
"家具安排。后来，我们可以制作一个房屋场景，在内部使用多个房间实例。我们将用许"
"多实例化的房子和一个大的地形来创建一个城堡，我们将把城堡放在这个地形上。每一"
"个场景都将是一个或多个子场景的实例。"

msgid ""
"Later, we could create scenes representing guards and add them to the "
"citadel. They would be indirectly added to the overall game world."
msgstr ""
"之后，我们可以创建代表守卫的场景，将它们加到城堡之中。也就会间接地加到了游戏"
"世界里。"

msgid ""
"With Godot, it's easy to iterate on your game like this, as all you need to "
"do is create and instantiate more scenes. We designed the editor to be "
"accessible to programmers, designers, and artists alike. A typical team "
"development process can involve 2D or 3D artists, level designers, game "
"designers, and animators, all working with the Godot editor."
msgstr ""
"使用 Godot，就可以很容易地像这样迭代你的游戏，因为你需要做的就是创建并实例化"
"更多的场景。我们将编辑器设计成了易于程序员、设计师、艺术家使用的形式。一个典"
"型的团队开发过程会涉及 2D 或 3D 美术、关卡设计师、游戏设计师、动画师等，他们"
"都可以用 Godot 编辑器工作。"

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "总结"

msgid ""
"Instancing, the process of producing an object from a blueprint, has many "
"handy uses. With scenes, it gives you:"
msgstr "实例化，从蓝图生成对象的过程有许多方便的用途。通过场景，它为你提供："

msgid "The ability to divide your game into reusable components."
msgstr "能将你的游戏分离成可以重复利用的组件。"

msgid "A tool to structure and encapsulate complex systems."
msgstr "一个构建和封装复杂系统的工具。"

msgid ""
"A language to think about your game project's structure in a natural way."
msgstr "一种以自然方式思考游戏项目结构的语言。"
