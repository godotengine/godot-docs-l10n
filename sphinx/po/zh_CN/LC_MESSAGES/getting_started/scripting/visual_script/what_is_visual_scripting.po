"Visual Scripting is a tool designed to make the entry barrier to programming "
"much lower. As code is more visual, it needs less abstract thinking to be "
"understood. Any artist, animator, game designer, etc. can look at it and "
"quickly grasp the flow of logic."

"The reason it does not make existing programming obsolete is, simply, that "
"it does not scale as well. It takes considerably more time to create code "
"with it, and it's often more difficult to modify than just writing a few "
"characters."
msgstr ""
"它没有使现有编程过时的原因很简单，就是它拓展性不强。用它来创建代码要花费相当"
