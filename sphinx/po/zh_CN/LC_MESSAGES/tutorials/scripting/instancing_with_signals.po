msgid "Instancing with signals"
msgstr "实例化与信号"

"Signals provide a way to decouple game objects, allowing you to avoid "
"forcing a fixed arrangement of nodes. One sign that a signal might be called "
"for is when you find yourself using ``get_parent()``. Referring directly to "
"a node's parent means that you can't easily move that node to another "
"location in the scene tree. This can be especially problematic when you are "
"instancing objects at runtime and may want to place them in an arbitrary "
"location in the running scene tree."
msgstr ""
"信号提供了一种解耦游戏对象的方式, 让你避免强行强制固定节点排列. 当使用 "
"``get_parent()`` 时, 你会发现可能需要调用信号的一个标志, 直接引用一个节点的父"
"节点意味着你不能轻易地将该节点移动到场景树的另一个位置. 当你在运行时实例化对"
"象, 并且可能想把它们放在运行中的场景树的任意位置时, 这可能是个问题."

msgid "Below we'll consider an example of such a situation: firing bullets."
msgstr "下面我们将考虑这种情况的一个例子: 发射子弹."

msgid "Shooting example"
msgstr "射击示例"

msgid ""
"Consider a player character that can rotate and shoot towards the mouse. "
"Every time the mouse button is clicked, we create an instance of the bullet "
"at the player's location. See :ref:`doc_instancing` for details."
msgstr ""
"考虑一个可以旋转并向鼠标射击的玩家角色. 每次点击鼠标按钮, 我们就在玩家的位置"
"创建一个子弹的实例. 详见 :ref:`doc_instancing` ."

msgid ""
"We'll use an ``Area2D`` for the bullet, which moves in a straight line at a "
"given velocity:"
msgstr "我们用 ``Area2D`` 来表示子弹, 它以给定的速度直线运动:"

msgid ""
"However, if the bullets are added as children of the player, then they will "
"remain \"attached\" to the player as it rotates:"
msgstr ""
"然而, 如果子弹作为游戏角色的子节点添加, 那么当它旋转时, 子弹将仍然保持 \"附着"
"\" 在游戏角色身上:"

msgid ""
"Instead, we need the bullets to be independent of the player's movement - "
"once fired, they should continue traveling in a straight line and the player "
"can no longer affect them. Instead of being added to the scene tree as a "
"child of the player, it makes more sense to add the bullet as a child of the "
"\"main\" game scene, which may be the player's parent or even further up the "
"tree."
msgstr ""
"相反, 我们需要子弹独立于游戏角色的移动——一旦发射, 子弹将持续沿着直线运动, 游"
"戏角色就不能再影响它们了. 与其作为游戏角色的子节点被添加到场景树中, 不如将子"
"弹作为 \"主\" 游戏场景的子节点添加上去更有意义, 后者可能是游戏角色的父节点, "
"甚至可能是更高层级的树."

msgid "You could do this by adding the bullet to the main scene directly:"
msgstr "你可以通过将子弹直接添加到主场景中来做到这一点:"

msgid ""
"However, this will lead to a different problem. Now if you try to test your "
"\"Player\" scene independently, it will crash on shooting, because there is "
"no parent node to access. This makes it a lot harder to test your player "
"code independently and also means that if you decide to change your main "
"scene's node structure, the player's parent may no longer be the appropriate "
"node to receive the bullets."
msgstr ""
"然而, 这将导致一个不同的问题. 现在, 如果你试图独立测试你的 \"Player\" 场景, "
"它将在射击时崩溃, 因为没有父节点可以访问. 这使得独立测试你的游戏角色代码变得"
"更加困难, 也意味着如果你决定改变你的主场景的节点结构, 游戏角色的父节点可能不"
"再是接收子弹的适当节点."

msgid ""
"The solution to this is to use a signal to \"emit\" the bullets from the "
"player. The player then has no need to \"know\" what happens to the bullets "
"after that - whatever node is connected to the signal can \"receive\" the "
"bullets and take the appropriate action to spawn them."
msgstr ""
"解决这个问题的方法是使用一个信号来 \"发射\" 游戏角色的子弹. 游戏角色不需要 "
"\"知道\" 子弹在那之后发生了什么——任何连接到信号的节点都可以 \"接收\" 子弹并采"
"取适当的行动来产生它们."

msgid "Here is the code for the player using signals to emit the bullet:"
msgstr "下面是游戏角色使用信号发射子弹的代码:"

msgid ""
"In the main scene, we then connect the player's signal (it will appear in "
"the \"Node\" tab)."
msgstr "在主场景中，我们连接游戏角色的信号（它将出现在“节点”选项卡中）。"

msgid ""
"Now the bullets will maintain their own movement independent of the player's "
"rotation:"
msgstr "现在子弹将自行运行，独立于游戏角色的旋转："

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
