msgid "What is GDNative?"
msgstr "GDNative 是什么？"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"**GDNative** is a Godot-specific technology that lets the engine interact "
"with native `shared libraries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries>`__ at run-time. You can use it to run "
"native code without compiling it with the engine."
msgstr ""
"**GDNative** 是 Godot 专有的技术，可以让引擎在运行时与原生\\ `共享库 "
"<https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/"
"%E5%87%BD%E5%BC%8F%E5%BA%AB#%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB%E5%BA%93>`\\ 交互。你可以用它"
"来运行原生代码，无需和引擎一同编译。"

msgid ""
"GDNative is *not* a scripting language and has no relation to :ref:`GDScript "
"<doc_gdscript>`."
msgstr "GDNative *不是*\\ 脚本语言，与 :ref:`GDScript <doc_gdscript>` 无关。"

msgid "Differences between GDNative and C++ modules"
msgstr "GDNative 与 C++ 模块的区别"

msgid ""
"You can use both GDNative and :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` "
"to run C or C++ code in a Godot project."
msgstr ""
"GDNative 和 :ref:`C++ 模块 <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>`\\ 都可以用于在 Godot "
"项目中执行 C 或 C++ 代码。"

msgid ""
"They also both allow you to integrate third-party libraries into Godot. The "
"one you should choose depends on your needs."
msgstr "它们都可以用来将第三方库集成进 Godot。选用哪一个取决于你的需求。"

msgid "Advantages of GDNative"
msgstr "GDNative 的优势"

msgid ""
"Unlike modules, GDNative doesn't require compiling the engine's source code, "
"making it easier to distribute your work. It gives you access to most of the "
"API available to GDScript C#, allowing you to code game logic with full "
"control regarding performance. It's ideal if you need high-performance code "
"you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the :ref:`asset library "
"<doc_what_is_assetlib>`."
msgstr ""
"与模块不同，GDNative 不需要编译引擎的源码，可以使你的作品更易于分发。它可以让"
"你访问 GDScript、C# 使用的大多数 API，让你在编写游戏逻辑时能够完全控制性能。"
"这是你在\\ :ref:`素材库 <doc_what_is_assetlib>`\\ 中以插件形式分发高性能代码"
"的理想选择。"

msgid "Also:"
msgstr "并且："

msgid ""
"GDNative is not limited to C and C++. Thanks to :ref:`third-party bindings "
"<doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, you can use it with many other "
"languages."
msgstr ""
"GDNative 并不仅限于 C 和 C++。得益于\\ :ref:`第三方绑定 "
"<doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`\\ ，你也可以在很多其他语言中使"
"用。"

msgid ""
"You can use the same compiled GDNative library in the editor and exported "
"project. With C++ modules, you have to recompile all the export templates "
"you plan to use if you require its functionality at run-time."
msgstr ""
"你可以在编辑器和导出项目中使用相同的编译后的 GDNative 库。而对于 C++ 模块，如"
"果你想在运行时使用相关功能，就必须重新编译所有想要使用的导出模板。"

msgid ""
"GDNative only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine. "
"That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine. "
"Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with "
"incremental builds, this process is slower than using GDNative."
msgstr ""
"GDNative 只需编译你自己的库，而不是整个引擎。C++ 模块则与此不同，是会静态编译"
"进引擎的。每修改一次模块，你就需要重新编译一次引擎。即使使用增量构建，这一过"
"程也比 GDNative 要慢。"

msgid "Advantages of C++ modules"
msgstr "C++ 模块的优势"

msgid ""
"We recommend :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` in cases where "
"GDNative isn't enough:"
msgstr ""
"如果 GDNative 无法满足要求，我们推荐使用 :ref:`C++ 模块 "
"<doc_custom_modules_in_c++>`\\ ："

msgid ""
"C++ modules provide deeper integration into the engine. GDNative's access is "
"limited to what the scripting API exposes."
msgstr "C++ 模块与引擎的集成更加紧密。GDNative 仅限于访问脚本所暴露的 API。"

msgid ""
"You can use C++ modules to provide additional features in a project without "
"carrying native library files around. This extends to exported projects."
msgstr ""
"使用 C++ 模块为项目提供额外功能，就可以免去携带原生库文件的麻烦。同样也适用于"
"导出的项目。"

msgid ""
"C++ modules are supported on all platforms. In contrast, GDNative isn't "
"supported on HTML5 and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) yet."
msgstr ""
"所有平台都支持 C++ 模块。而 HTML5 和通用 Windows 平台（UWP）则尚不支持 "
"GDNative。"

msgid ""
"C++ modules can be faster than GDNative, especially when the code requires a "
"lot of communication through the scripting API."
msgstr ""
"C++ 模块比 GDNative 要快，尤其是在代码需要通过脚本 API 做大量通信的情况下。"

msgid "Supported languages"
msgstr "支持的语言"

msgid ""
"The Godot developers officially support the following language bindings for "
"GDNative:"
msgstr "Godot 开发者官方支持以下 GDNative 语言绑定："

msgid ""
"There are no plans to support additional languages with GDNative officially. "
"That said, the community offers several bindings for other languages (see "
"below)."
msgstr ""
"没有官方支持更多 GDNative 语言的计划。不过社区提供了不少其他语言的绑定（见下"

"Not all bindings mentioned here may be production-ready. Make sure to "
"research options thoroughly before starting a project with one of those. "
"Also, double-check whether the binding is compatible with the Godot version "
"you're using."
msgstr ""
"这里列出的绑定并不都能用于生产。请在新项目中使用前先做足调查。同时，请确定该"

msgid "Version compatibility"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Unlike Godot itself <doc_release_policy>`, GDNative has stricter "
"version compatibility requirements as it relies on low-level *ptrcalls* to "
"function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDNative add-ons compiled for a given Godot version are only guaranteed to "
"work with the same minor release series. For example, a GDNative add-on "
"compiled for Godot 3.4 will only work with Godot 3.4, 3.4.1, 3.4.2… but not "
"Godot 3.3 or 3.5."
