msgid "Pausing games and process mode"
msgstr "暂停游戏与处理模式"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"In most games it is desirable to, at some point, interrupt the game to do "
"something else, such as taking a break or changing options. Implementing a "
"fine-grained control for what can be paused (and what cannot) is a lot of "
"work, so a simple framework for pausing is provided in Godot."
msgstr ""
"在大多数游戏中，或多或少都会希望能够中断游戏去干些别的，例如休息一下或者修改"
"选项。要非常细致地控制哪些可以暂停（哪些不可以）实现起来非常麻烦，所以 Godot "
"提供了一个简单的暂停框架。"

msgid "How pausing works"
msgstr "如何暂停工作"

msgid ""
"To pause the game the pause state must be set. This is done by assigning "
"``true`` to the :ref:`SceneTree.paused <class_SceneTree_property_paused>` "
"property:"
msgstr ""
"要将游戏暂停，就必须设置暂停状态。将 :ref:`SceneTree.paused "
"<class_SceneTree_property_paused>` 属性赋值为 ``true`` 即可："

msgid ""
"Doing this will cause two things. First, 2D and 3D physics will be stopped "
"for all nodes. Second, the behavior of certain nodes will stop or start "
"depending on their process mode."
msgstr ""
"这样做会导致两件事。首先，所有节点的 2D 和 3D 物理都会停止。其次，根据处理模"
"式的不同，某些节点的行为会停止或者开始。"

msgid ""
"The physics servers can be made active while the game is paused by using "
"their ``set_active`` methods."
msgstr "游戏暂停时，可以通过 ``set_active`` 方法激活物理服务器。"

msgid "Process Modes"
msgstr "处理模式"

msgid ""
"Each node in Godot has a \"Pause Mode\" that defines when it processes. It "
"can be found and changed under a node's :ref:`Node <class_Node>` properties "
"in the inspector."
msgstr ""
"Godot 中的节点都有“Pause Mode”（暂停模式）定义它们应该在何时进行处理。可以在"
"检查器中 :ref:`Node <class_Node>` 的属性里找到并修改。"

msgid "You can also alter the property with code:"
msgstr "你也可以通过代码来修改该属性："

msgid "This is what each mode tells a node to do:"
msgstr "各个模式对节点的要求是这样的："

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"**Inherit**: Process depending on the state of the parent, grandparent, etc. "
"The first parent that has a state other than Inherit determines the "
"effective value that will be used."
msgstr ""
"**Inherit（继承）** ：处理与否取决于父、祖父等等节点中第一个非 Inherit 状态的"
"节点。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"**Stop**: If the scene tree is paused, pause the node no matter what (and "
"children in Inherit mode). When paused, this node *will not* process."
msgstr ""
"**Stop（停止）** ：无条件停止节点（以及 Inherit 模式的子节点）。暂停时该节点"
"不会进行处理。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"**Process**: Even if the scene tree is paused, process the node no matter "
"what (and children in Inherit mode). Paused or not, this node *will* process."
msgstr ""
"**Process（处理）** ：无条件处理节点（以及 Inherit 模式的子节点）。无论暂停与"
"否，该节点都会进行处理。"

msgid ""
"By default, all nodes have this property in the \"Inherit\" state. If the "
"parent is set to \"Inherit\", then the grandparent will be checked and so "
"on. If a state can't be found in any of the grandparents, the pause state in "
"SceneTree is used. This means that, by default, when the game is paused "
"every node will be paused. Several things happen when a node stops "
"processing."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下，所有节点的这个属性都是“Inherit”状态。如果父节点也是“Inherit”，那"
"么就会去检查祖父节点，以此类推。如果祖宗们都没有更改过状态，那么就会使用 "
"SceneTree 的暂停状态。也就是说，在游戏暂停时默认所有节点都会被暂停下来。节点"
"停止处理时会发生不少事情。"

msgid ""
"The ``_process``, ``_physics_process``, ``_input``, and ``_input_event`` "
"functions will not be called. However signals still work and cause their "
"connected function to run, even if that function's script is attached to a "
"node that has its pause mode set to \"Stop\"."
msgstr ""
"``_process``\\ 、\\ ``_physics_process``\\ 、\\ ``_input``\\ 、\\ "
"``_input_event`` 函数都不会再被调用。不过信号仍然是正常工作的，因此它们连接的"
"函数也会执行，即便该函数的脚本是附加在暂停模式为“Stop”的节点上的。"

msgid ""
"Animation nodes will pause their current animation, audio nodes will pause "
"their current audio stream, and particles will pause. These resume "
"automatically when the game is no longer paused."
msgstr ""
"动画节点会暂停它们的当前动画，音频节点会暂停它们的当前音频流，粒子也会暂停。"
"游戏不再暂停时，它们都会自动继续运行。"

msgid ""
"It is important to note that even if a node is processing while the game is "
"paused physics will **NOT** work for it by default. As stated earlier this "
"is because the physics servers are turned off. The physics servers can be "
"made active while the game is paused by using their ``set_active`` methods."
msgstr ""
"请注意有一点非常重要，即便游戏暂停时节点仍在进行处理，但物理默认是\\ **无法"
"**\\ 正常工作的。如前文所述，这是因为物理服务器会被关闭。游戏暂停时，可以通"
"过 ``set_active`` 方法激活物理服务器。"

msgid "Pause Menu Example"
msgstr "暂停菜单示例"

msgid ""
"Here is an example of a pause menu. Create a popup or panel with controls "
"inside, and set its pause mode to \"Process\" then hide it. By setting the "
"root of the pause popup to \"Process\", all children and grandchildren will "
"inherit that state. This way, this branch of the scene tree will continue "
"working when paused."
msgstr ""
"这是一个暂停菜单的例子。创建一个弹框或者面板，里面放上控件，然后将其暂停模式"
"设为“Process”并隐藏。将暂停弹框根节点设为“Process”后，它的所有子孙节点都会继"
"承该状态。这样，场景树的这个分支就会在暂停时继续工作。"

msgid ""
"Finally, make it so when a pause button is pressed (any button will do), "
"enable the pause and show the pause screen."
msgstr "最后，当按下暂停按钮（任何按钮都可以）时，启用暂停并显示暂停界面。"

msgid "To unpause, do the opposite when the pause screen is closed:"
msgstr "要解除暂停，请在暂停界面关闭时执行相反操作："

msgid "Translation status"
