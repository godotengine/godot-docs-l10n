"Visual Scripting is a tool designed to make the entry barrier to programming "
"much lower. As code is more visual, it needs less abstract thinking to be "
"understood. Any artist, animator, game designer, etc. can look at it and "
"quickly grasp the flow of logic."
msgstr ""
"可视化脚本（Visual Scripting）是一种工具，用于降低编程的入口壁垒。由于代码更"
"直观，它需要较少的抽象思维来理解。任何艺术家、动画师、游戏设计师等都可以看到"
"它，并快速掌握逻辑流程。"

"The reason it does not make existing programming obsolete is, simply, that "
"it does not scale as well. It takes considerably more time to create code "
"with it, and it's often more difficult to modify than just writing a few "
"characters."
msgstr ""
"它没有使现有编程过时的原因很简单, 就是它拓展性不强. 用它来创建代码要花费相当"
"多的时间, 并且修改它通常比仅仅编写几个字符更困难."

msgid ""
"With the misunderstanding cleared up, the question that remains is what are "
"the practical uses for Visual Scripting."
msgstr "随着误解的消除, 剩下的问题是可视化脚本的实际用途是什么."

msgid "The most common use cases are as follows:"
msgstr "最常见的用例如下:"

msgid ""
"Game development beginners who want to learn an engine but have no "
"programming experience yet."
msgstr "游戏开发新手, 想要学习引擎, 但还没有编程经验."

msgid ""
"Artists and Game Designers who have no experience in programming and want to "
"create quick prototypes or simple games."
msgstr "没有编程经验的艺术家和游戏设计师, 希望快速创建游戏原型或简单的游戏."

msgid ""
"Programmers working in a team that want to make part of the game logic "
"available to Artists or Game Designers in order to offload some of their "
"work."
msgstr ""
"在一个团队中工作的程序员, 希望将游戏逻辑的一部分提供给艺术家或游戏设计师, 以"
"便减少他们的工作负担."

msgid ""
"These scenarios are far more common than one might think, so this is why "
"Godot has added this feature."
msgstr "这些场景比人们想象的要普遍得多, 因此这就是Godot添加此功能的原因."
