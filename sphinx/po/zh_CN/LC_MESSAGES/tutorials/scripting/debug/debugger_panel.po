"Many of Godot's debugging tools, including the debugger, can be found in the "
"debugger panel at the bottom of the screen. Click on **Debugger** to open it."
msgstr ""
"在屏幕下方的调试器面板中, 可以找到包括调试器在内的许多Godot的调试工具. 点击 "

"program's execution."

"debugging sessions."
msgstr "跳过所有断点. 这样一来, 你就可以为将来的调试会话保存断点."

msgid "Copy the current error message."
msgstr "复制当前错误消息."

msgid ""
"**Step Into** the code. This button takes you to the next line of code, and "
"if it's a function, it steps line-by-line through the function."
msgstr ""
"**步入** 代码. 这个按钮将带你进入下一行代码, 如果是函数, 它将逐行进入函数."

msgid ""
"**Step Over** the code. This button goes to the next line of code, but it "

msgstr "**继续** . 该按钮在断点或暂停后恢复游戏."

msgid ""
"Breakpoints won't break on code if it's :ref:`running in a thread "
"<doc_using_multiple_threads>`. This is a current limitation of the GDScript "
"debugger."

msgid "Profiler"
msgstr "性能分析器"

msgid ""
"The debugger comes with three profilers for your processor, network "
"operations, and video memory."
msgstr "调试器带有三个剖析器, 分别用于你的处理器, 网络操作和视频内存."

msgid ""
"The profiler is used to show why individual frames take as long as they do "
"to process and render."
msgstr "剖析器用于显示为什么单个帧的处理和渲染时间与它们一样长."

msgid ""
"Unlike other debugging tools, the profiler does not start automatically. It "
"can be started at any time during gameplay by pressing the start button. You "
"can even start the profiler before opening the game to profile startup "
"performance. It can also be started and stopped while the game is running "
"without losing information from when it was last running. The information it "
"records won't go away unless you click clear, or close the game, reopen it "
"and start the profiler again."
msgstr ""
"与其他调试工具不同, 剖析器不会自动启动. 它可以在游戏过程中随时按启动按钮启"
"动. 你甚至可以在打开游戏之前启动剖析器, 以剖析启动性能. 它也可以在游戏运行时"
"启动和停止, 而不会丢失上次运行时的信息. 它记录的信息不会消失, 除非你点击清"
"除, 或者关闭游戏, 重新打开游戏并再次启动剖析器."

msgid ""
"After starting and stopping the profiler, you should see things being kept "
"track of on the left and a graph on the right. The items listed on the left "
"are everything that contributes to frame time, and they should each have a "
"value for time and calls for the current frame you are looking at."
msgstr ""

msgstr "网络分析器"

msgid ""
"The Network Profiler contains a list of all the nodes that communicate over "

msgstr "监视"

msgid ""
"The monitors are graphs of several aspects of the game while its running "

"changed."
msgstr ""
"监视器是游戏运行时几个方面的图表, 如FPS, 内存使用情况, 场景中的节点数量等等. "
