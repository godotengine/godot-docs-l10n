"This guide will give you an overview of the available debugging tools in the "
"engine."
msgstr "本指南将概述引擎中可用的调试工具."

msgid ""
"Godot comes with a powerful debugger and profilers to track down bugs, "
"inspect your game at runtime, monitor essential metrics, and measure "
"performances. It also offers options to visualize collision boxes and "
"navigation polygons in the running game."
msgstr ""
"Godot自带强大的调试器和剖析器, 可以追踪bug, 在运行时检查你的游戏, 监控重要指"
"标, 并测量性能. 它还提供了在运行游戏中可视化碰撞框和导航多边形的选项."

msgid ""
"Finally, you have options to debug the game running on a remote device and "
"to reload changes to your scenes or your code while the game is running."
msgstr ""
"最后, 你可以选择调试在远程设备上运行的游戏, 并在游戏运行时重新加载对你的场景"
"或代码的修改."

"Many of Godot's debugging tools are part of the Debugger panel, which you "
"can find information about in :ref:`doc_debugger_panel`."

msgid ""
"There are a few common debug options you can toggle on or off when running "
"your game in the editor, which can help you in debugging your game."
msgstr ""
"在编辑器中运行游戏时, 有几个常见的调试选项可以切换为开或关, 以帮助你调试游戏."

msgstr "你可以在编辑器菜单\\ **调试**\\ 中找到这些选项。"

msgid "Here are the descriptions of the options:"
msgstr "下面是这些选项的说明："

msgid "Deploy with Remote Debug"
msgstr "使用远程调试部署"

msgid ""
"When exporting and deploying, the resulting executable will attempt to "
"connect to the IP of your computer for debugging."
msgstr "当导出和部署时, 产生的可执行文件将尝试连接到你的计算机的IP上进行调试."

msgid "Small Deploy with Network FS"
msgstr "使用网络文件系统进行小型部署"

msgid ""
"This option speeds up testing for games with a large footprint on remote "
"devices."
msgstr "这个选项加快了在远程设备上进行大足迹游戏的测试."

msgid ""
"When **Small Deploy with Network FS** is on, instead of exporting the full "
"game, deploying the game builds a minimal executable. The editor then "
"provides files from the project over the network."
msgstr ""
"当\\ **使用网络文件系统进行小型部署**\\ 开启时，部署游戏不是导出整个游戏，而"
"是建立一个最小的可执行文件。然后，编辑器通过网络提供项目中的文件。"

msgid ""
"Also, on Android, the game is deployed using the USB cable to speed up "
"deployment."
msgstr "另外，在 Android 系统上，游戏采用 USB 线部署，加快部署速度。"

msgid "Visible Collision Shapes"

msgid "Sync Scene Changes"
msgstr "同步场景修改"

msgid ""

"appears instantly. When used remotely on a device, this is more efficient "
"with the network filesystem."
msgstr ""
"使用此选项, 在运行时对编辑器中的场景所做的任何更改都会立即显示. 当在设备上远"
"程使用时, 这对网络文件系统来说更为有效."

msgid "Sync Script Changes"
msgstr "同步脚本修改"

msgid ""
"Any script that is saved will be reloaded on the running game. When used "
"remotely on a device, this is more efficient with the network filesystem."
msgstr ""
"任何被保存的脚本都会被重新加载到正在运行的游戏上. 当在设备上远程使用时, 这对"
"网络文件系统来说更有效率."

msgid "Script editor debug tools and options"
msgstr "脚本编辑器调试工具和选项"

msgid ""
"The script editor has its own set of debug tools for use with breakpoints "
"and two options. The breakpoint tools can also be found in the **Debugger** "
"tab of the debugger."
msgstr ""
"脚本编辑器有自己的一套调试工具，用于断点和两个选项。断点工具也可以在调试器的"
"\\ **调试器**\\ 选项卡中找到。"

msgid ""
"You can create a breakpoint by clicking the gutter in the left of the script "
"editor (on the left of the line numbers). When hovering this gutter, you "
"will see a transparent red dot appearing, which turns into an opaque red dot "
"after the breakpoint is placed by clicking. Click the red dot again to "
"remove the breakpoint. Breakpoints created this way persist across editor "
"restarts, even if the script wasn't saved when exiting the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also use the ``breakpoint`` keyword in GDScript to create a "
"breakpoint that is stored in the script itself. Unlike breakpoints created "
"by clicking in the gutter, this keyword-based breakpoint is persistent "
"across different machines when using version control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **Break** button causes a break in the script like a breakpoint would. "
"**Continue** makes the game continue after pausing at a breakpoint. **Step "
"Over** goes to the next line of code, and **Step Into** goes into a function "
"if possible. Otherwise, it does the same thing as **Step Over**."
msgstr ""
"**断点** 按钮会像断点一样导致脚本的中断. **继续** 使游戏在断点处暂停后继续. "
"**Step Over** 进入下一行代码, 如果可能的话, **Step Into** 进入一个函数. 否"
"则, 它与 **Step Over** 做同样的事情."
