msgid "Physics properties"
msgstr "物理属性"

msgid ""
"Exporting physics properties is done by enabling \"Rigid Body\" in Blender's "
"physics tab:"
msgstr "通过在 Blenders 物理选项卡中，启用“Rigid Body”（刚体）来导出物理属性："

msgid ""
"By default, a single Blender object with rigid body enabled will export as "
"three nodes: a PhysicsBody, a CollisionShape, and a MeshInstance."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下，启用了刚体的单个 Blender 对象将导出为三个节点：PhysicsBody、"
"CollisionShape、MeshInstance。"

msgid "Body type"
msgstr "物体类型"

msgid ""
"Blender only has the concept of \"Active\" and \"Passive\" rigid bodies. "
"These turn into Static and RigidBody nodes. To create a kinematic body, "
"enable the \"animated\" checkbox on an \"Active\" body:"
msgstr ""
"Blender只有 \"活动\" 和 \"不活动\" 刚体的概念. 这些转变为Static和RigidBody节"
"点. 要创建运动体, 请在 \"活动\" 物体上启用 \"动画化\" 复选框:"

msgid "Collision shapes"
msgstr "碰撞形状"

msgid ""
"Many of the parameters for collision shapes are missing from Blender, and "
"many of the collision shapes are also not present. However, almost all of "
"the options in Blender's rigid body collision and rigid body dynamics "
"interfaces are supported:"
msgstr ""
"Blender中缺少碰撞形状的许多参数, 并且许多碰撞形状也不存在. 但是, 支持Blender"
"刚体碰撞和刚体动力学界面中的几乎所有选项:"

msgid "There are the following caveats:"
msgstr "有以下注意事项:"

msgid ""
"Not all of the collision shapes are supported. Only ``Mesh``, ``Convex "
"Hull``, ``Capsule``, ``Sphere`` and ``Box`` are supported in both Blender "
"and Godot"
msgstr ""
"并非所有碰撞形状都受支持.Blender和Godot只同时支持 ``Mesh``, ``Convex Hull``, "
"``Capsule``, ``Sphere`` 和 ``Box``"

msgid ""
"In Godot, you can have different collision groups and collision masks. In "
"Blender you only have collision groups. As a result, the exported object's "
"collision mask is equal to its collision group. Most of the time, this is "
"what you want."
msgstr ""
"在Godot中, 您可以有不同的碰撞编组和碰撞遮罩. 在Blender中, 您只有碰撞编组. 因"
"此, 导出对象的碰撞遮罩等于其碰撞编组. 大多数时候, 这就是您想要的."

msgid ""
"To build compound physics shapes, parent together multiple objects with "
"rigid body enabled. The physics properties are taken from the parent-most "
"rigid body, and the rest are used as collision shapes."
msgstr ""
"要构建复合物理形状, 请启用将刚体设置为多个对象的父级. 物理属性取自最高父级的"
"刚体, 其余用作碰撞形状."

msgid "Collision geometry only"
msgstr "仅碰撞几何"

msgid ""
"Frequently you want different geometry for your collision meshes and your "
"graphical meshes, but by default, the exporter will export a mesh along with "
"the collision shape. To only export the collision shape, set the object's "
"maximum draw type to Wire:"
msgstr ""
"通常, 你希望碰撞网格和图形网格有不同的几何形状, 但默认情况下, 导出器会将网格"
"和碰撞形状一起导出, 要只导出碰撞形状, 请将对象的最大绘制类型设置为Wire:"

msgid ""
"This will also influence how the object is shown in Blender's viewport. Most "
"of the time, you want your collision geometry to be shown see-through when "
"working on the models, so this works out fairly nicely."
msgstr ""
"这也将影响对象在Blender视图中的显示方式. 大多数时候, 您希望在处理模型时透明显"
"示碰撞几何体, 因此效果很好."

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
