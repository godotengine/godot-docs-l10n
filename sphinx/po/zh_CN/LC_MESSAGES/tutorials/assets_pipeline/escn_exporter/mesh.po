"There is an exporting option :code:`Apply Modifiers` to control whether mesh "
"modifiers are applied to the exported mesh."
msgstr ""
"有一个导出选项“Apply Modifiers”（应用修改器），用来控制是否将网格修改器应用于"
"导出的网格。"

msgid "Shape Key"
msgstr "形状键"

"Exporting mesh shape key is supported, however exporting each shape key is "
"almost like exporting the mesh again, so don't be surprised it takes a "
"relatively long time."

"支持导出网格形状键, 但是导出每个形状键几乎就像再次导出网格一样, 所以不要惊讶"
"它需要相对长的时间."

msgid ""
"A lot of modifiers are not compatible with shape keys (e.g. subsurface "
"modifier), so if you found you have incorrect shape keys exported, try to "
"disable :code:`Apply Modifiers` and do the exporting again. Besides, it is "
"worthwhile to report the incompatible modifier to the `issue list <https://"
"github.com/godotengine/godot-blender-exporter/issues>`__, which helps to "
"develop the exporter to have a more precise check of modifiers."
msgstr ""
"许多修改器与形状键不兼容（例如次表面修改器），因此如果发现导出的形状键不正"
"确，请尝试禁用 :code:`应用修改器` 并再次进行导出。此外，值得将不兼容的修改器"
"报告给\\ `问题列表 <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-blender-exporter/"
"issues>`__\\ ，这有助于开发导出器以更准确地检查修改器。"
