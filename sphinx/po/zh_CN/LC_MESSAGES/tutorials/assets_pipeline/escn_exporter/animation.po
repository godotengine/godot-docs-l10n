msgid "Animation"

msgid "Animation supported:"
msgstr "支持的动画："

msgid "transform animation of all types of objects"
msgstr "所有类型对象的变换动画"

msgid "transform animation of pose bones"
msgstr "姿势骨骼的变换动画"

msgid "shape key animation"
msgstr "形状键动画"

msgid "light animation"
msgstr "灯光动画"

msgid "camera animation"
msgstr "摄像机动画"

msgid "Multiple Actions For Single Object"
msgstr "单个对象的多个动作"

msgid ""
"In most games, one object would have several animations to switch between. "
"This add-on has support for exporting multiple actions all at once into a "
"single AnimationPlayer and makes it easy to switch actions."
msgstr ""
"在大多数游戏中，一个对象会有几个动画来切换。这个插件支持将多个动作同时导出到"
"单个 AnimationPlayer 中，使切换动作变得很容易。"

msgid ""
"This workflow makes use of blender nla_tracks. Here is a brief guide on how "
"to use this feature:"
msgstr "此工作流程使用 Blender 的 nla_track。以下是如何使用此功能的简要指南："

msgid "**1. Stash active action**"
msgstr "**1. 暂存活动动作**"

msgid ""
"New created action is always an active action bound to object. There are "
"several ways to place an active action into NLA track, one is of course "
"doing it in ``NLA Editor``"
msgstr ""
"新创建的动作始终是绑定到对象的活动动作. 有几种方法可以在NLA轨道上放置活动动"
"作, 一种当然是在 ``NLA编辑器`` 中"

msgid "Or it can be done stashing the action in ``Dope Sheet``"
msgstr "或者可以将动作暂存在 ``动画摄影表`` 中"

msgid "**2. Check mute status of NLA tracks**"
msgstr "**2. 检查NLA轨道的静默状态**"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"An NLA track can be ``mute`` or ``unmute``, the exporter will export all the "
"``mute`` NLA track as a separate action, while blends all the ``unmute`` NLA "
"tracks into every action (including the action) being exported."
msgstr ""
"NLA轨道可以是 ``静默`` 或 ``取消静默``, 导出器将导出所有 ``静默`` NLA轨道作为"
"一个单独的动作, 将所有 ``取消静默`` NLA轨道混合到输出的每个动作(包括活动动作)"
"中."

msgid "**3. Export the scene**"
msgstr "**3. 导出场景**"

msgid "Make sure the ``Export Stashed Actions`` option has been turned on."
msgstr "确保开启 ``导出暂存动作`` 选项."

msgid ""
"Then all the stashed actions, as well as the active action, are exported to "
"an AnimationPlayer."
msgstr "所有暂存的动作，以及活动动作，都将导出到一个 AnimationPlayer 中。"

msgid "Constraints"
msgstr "约束"

msgid ""
"Sometimes complicated animation is built with object constraint; a usual "
"example is inverse kinematics. The add-on would automatically check if an "
"object has some constraint; if it does, all the constraints are baked into "
"actions and then exported along with the object."
msgstr ""
"有时使用对象约束构建复杂动画, 通常的示例是反向运动学. 插件会自动检查对象是否"
"有某些约束；如果有, 则所有约束都被烘焙到对象具有的每个动作中, 然后导出."

msgid "Animation Mode"
msgstr "动画模式"

msgid ""
"Godot and Blender have different structure to store animation data. In Godot "
"animation data is stored in an AnimationPlayer node, instead of in each "
"animated node. In order to fix this inconsistence and still make the "
"animation play versatile, this add-on has three animation exporting modes."
msgstr ""
"Godot 和 Blender 用不同的结构来存储动画数据。在 Godot 中，动画数据存储在一个 "
"AnimationPlayer 节点中，与被动画的节点无关。为了修复这种不一致性，同时让动画"
"发挥其功能，这个插件有三种动画导出模式。"

msgid "**Mode 'Animation as Actions'**"
msgstr "**\"动画作为动作\" 模式**"

msgid ""
"Treat all the animations as object actions, so in the exported scene, every "
"object would have its own AnimationPlayer and hold its actions."
msgstr ""
"将所有动画视为对象动作，因此在导出的场景中，每个对象都有自己的 "
"AnimationPlayer 来存储其动作。"

msgid "**Mode 'Scene Animation'**"
msgstr "**\"场景动画\" 模式**"

msgid ""
"If you want your animation to generate the same result as playing at "
"Blender's timeline, this is what you want. In this mode, all the animations "
"in the scene are placed in just one AnimationPlayer in the scene root."
msgstr ""
"如果你希望动画生成与在 Blender 的时间轴上播放相同的结果，这就是你想要的。在此"
"模式下，场景中的所有动画都只放置在场景根中的一个 AnimationPlayer 中。"

msgid "**Mode 'Animation as Action with Squash'**"
msgstr "**\"动画作为压缩动作\" 模式**"

msgid ""
"This mode has very similar behavior of mode 'Animation as Action', but it "
"can generate fewer AnimationPlayers; objects in parent-children relationship "
"would share their AnimationPlayer. It is useful when you have several rigs, "
"and each Skeleton and Mesh has actions; then one rig would have just one "
"AnimationPlayer."
msgstr ""
"这种模式与“动画即动作”模式的行为非常相似，但它可以生成较少的 "
"AnimationPlayer；父子关系的对象将共享他们的 AnimationPlayer。当你有多个装备，"
"并且每个 Skeleton 和 Mesh 都有动作时，这种模式就很有用；那么一个装备就只有一"
"个 AnimationPlayer。"
