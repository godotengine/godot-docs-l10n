"Armature object in Blender is exported as a Skeleton node along with rest "

"The three check boxes :code:`Inherit Rotation`, :code:`Inherit Scale`, :code:"
"`Local Location` (colored in red) must be ticked when building armature in "
"Blender, so that the exported bone transform be consistent between Blender "

msgstr ""
"三个复选框 ``Inherit Rotation``, ``Inherit Scale``, ``Local Location`` (红色)"
"必须在Blender中构建骨架时勾选, 以便在Blender和Godot之间, 导出的骨骼变换一致"

"It is important that the mesh is not deformed by bones when exporting in "
"Blender. Make sure that the skeleton is reset to its T-pose or default rest "
"pose."
msgstr ""
"当在 Blender 导出时，网格不会被骨骼变形很重要。确保骨架复位为其 T 型姿势或默"

msgid "Bone Weights"
msgstr "骨骼权重"

msgid ""
"Blender put rigged mesh vertices which has no bone weights at its original "
"position, but these vertices would be placed at (0, 0, 0) in Godot, making "
"the mesh deformed. Therefore, the exporter would raise an error for any "
"vertex with no bone weights detected in a rigged mesh."
msgstr ""
"Blender在其原始位置放置了没有骨骼权重的已绑定网格顶点, 但是这些顶点将放置在"
"Godot中的 (0, 0, 0) 处, 从而使网格形变. 因此, 对于在绑定网格中未检测到骨骼权"
"重的任何顶点, 导出器都会引发错误."

msgid "Non-Deform Bone"
msgstr "非形变骨骼"

msgid ""
"Note that the non-deform bone can be configured as not exported by enabling "
"the :code:`Exclude Control Bones`; the deform bone checkbox is shown in the "

msgstr ""
"请注意，通过启用 :code:`Exclude Control Bones` 可以将未形变骨骼配置为不导出；"

msgid "Bone Attachment"
msgstr "骨骼附件"

msgid ""
"A bone can be the parent of an object in Blender; this relation is exported "
