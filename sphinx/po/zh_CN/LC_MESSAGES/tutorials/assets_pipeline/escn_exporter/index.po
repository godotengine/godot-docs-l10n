"This plugin can be used to export Blender scenes in a Godot-specific scene "
"format called ESCN, which is similar to TSCN (text format) but will be "
"imported as binary SCN for performance."

"该插件可用于以Godot特定的场景格式ESCN, 来导出Blender场景, 该格式类似于TSCN(文"

"Sometimes you don't want some objects exported (e.g. high-res models used "
"for baking). An object will not be exported if it is not rendered in the "
"scene. This can be set in the outliner:"

"If you have hundreds of model files, you don't want your artists to waste "
"time manually exporting their blend files. To combat this, the exporter "
"provides a Python function ``io_scene_godot.export(out_file_path)`` that can "
"be called to export a file. This allows easy integration with other build "
"systems. An example Makefile and Python script that exports all the blends "
"in a directory are present in the `godot-blender-exporter repository "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot-blender-exporter>`__."
msgstr ""
"如果你有数百个模型文件，不希望艺术家浪费时间手动导出他们的 blend 文件。为了解"
"决这个问题，导出器提供了一个 Python 函数 ``io_scene_godot."
"export(out_file_path)``\\ ，可以调用它来导出文件。这样可以轻松地与其他构建系"
"统集成。将所有 blend 文件导出到同一目录的示例 Makefile 和 Python 脚本位于 "
"`godot-blender-exporter 存储库 <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-blender-"
"exporter>`__ 中。"
