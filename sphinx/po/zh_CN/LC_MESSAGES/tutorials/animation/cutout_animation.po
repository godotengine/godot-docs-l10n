"Traditionally, `cutout animation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Cutout_animation>`__ is a type of `stop motion animation <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion>`__ in which pieces of paper (or other thin "
"material) are cut into special shapes and arranged in two-dimensional "
"representations of characters and objects. Characters' bodies are usually "
"made out of several pieces. The pieces are arranged and photographed once "
"for each frame of the film. The animator moves and rotates the parts in "
"small increments between each shot to create the illusion of movement when "
"the images are played back quickly in sequence."
msgstr ""
"传统意义上, `剪影动画 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutout_animation>`__ 是"
"一种 `定格动画 <https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/"
"%E5%AE%9A%E6%A0%BC%E5%8A%A8%E7%94%BB>`__ . 在剪影动画中, 人们把纸片(或者其他"
"的薄材料)剪成特殊的形状, 来组合成角色和物体的二维形象. 角色的身体通常是由几个"
"部件组成的. 这些部件在动画的每一帧中形成一种组合, 之后对其摄影. 动画制作者在"
"两次摄影之间将这些部分进行很小幅度的移动和旋转, 这样, 当这些摄影的画面以很快"
"的速度连续依次播放时, 就可以造成这些角色和物体在连续运动的假象."

msgid "IK chains"

"IK stands for inverse kinematics. It's a convenient technique for animating "

"rotating and positioning several other bones (the shin and the thigh at "
"least). This would be quite complex and lead to imprecise results. IK allows "
"us to move the foot directly while the shin and thigh self-adjust."
msgstr ""
"IK 是反向动力学（Inverse Kinematics）的缩写，给手部、足部以及其它需绑定肢体"
"（例如我们刚刚制作的那个）的动画带来便利。想象一下，你想要将角色的脚放在地面"

"得涉及大腿及小腿）。这将非常复杂并导致不精确的结果。而 IK 允许我们直接移动"
"脚，同时小腿和大腿进行自我调整。"

msgid ""
"**IK chains in Godot currently work in the editor only**, not at runtime. "
"They are intended to ease the process of setting keyframes, and are not "
"currently useful for techniques like procedural animation."
msgstr ""
"**Godot 中的 IK 链目前仅在编辑器中可用** ，而在运行时不可用。它们旨在简化设置"
"关键帧的过程，目前对于程序动画等技术没有用处。"

"To create an IK chain, select a chain of bones from endpoint to the base for "
"the chain. For example, to create an IK chain for the right leg, select the "
"following:"

"要创建 IK 链，请选择从端点到链基的骨骼链。例如，要为右腿创建一条 IK 链，选择"
