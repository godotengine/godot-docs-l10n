"Typically, you would use bones and a :ref:`Skeleton3D <class_Skeleton3D>` to "

"完全在 GPU 上，使用几行代码来计算完整的动画。"

msgid "The animation will be made of four key motions:"
msgstr "动画由四个关键帧动作组成:"

msgid "A side to side motion"
msgstr "从一边运动到另一边"

msgid "A pivot motion around the center of the fish"
msgstr "绕着鱼的中心作旋转运动"

msgid "A panning wave motion"
msgstr "平移波动运动"

msgid "A panning twist motion"
msgstr "平移扭转运动"

msgid ""
"All the code for the animation will be in the vertex shader with uniforms "
"controlling the amount of motion. We use uniforms to control the strength of "
"the motion so that you can tweak the animation in editor and see the results "
"in real time, without the shader having to recompile."
msgstr ""
"所有的动画代码都在顶点着色器中，并由 uniform 控制运动量。我们使用 uniform 来"
"控制运动的强度，这样你就可以在编辑器中调整动画，并实时看到结果，而不用重新编"
"译着色器。"

msgid ""
"All the motions will be made using cosine waves applied to ``VERTEX`` in "
"model space. We want the vertices to be in model space so that the motion is "
"always relative to the orientation of the fish. For example, side-to-side "
"will always move the fish back and forth in its left to right direction, "
"instead of on the ``x`` axis in the world orientation."
msgstr ""
"所有的运动都将使用余弦波应用于模型空间中的 ``VERTEX`` . 我们希望顶点在模型空"
"间中, 使运动总是相对于鱼的方向. 例如,side-to-side将始终使鱼在其左至右的方向上"
"来回移动, 而不是在世界方向的 ``x`` 轴上."

msgid ""
"In order to control the speed of the animation, we will start by defining "
"our own time variable using ``TIME``."
msgstr "为了控制动画的速度，我们将通过使用 ``TIME`` 定义自己的时间变量开始。"

msgid ""
"The first motion we will implement is the side to side motion. It can be "
"made by offsetting ``VERTEX.x`` by ``cos`` of ``TIME``. Each time the mesh "
"is rendered, all the vertices will move to the side by the amount of "
"``cos(time)``."
msgstr ""
"我们将实施的第一项议案是左右运动. 它可以通过 ``TIME`` 的 ``cos`` 抵消 "
"``VERTEX.x`` 来制作. 每次渲染网格时, 所有顶点都会移动到 \"cos(时间)\" 的数量."

msgid "The resulting animation should look something like this:"
msgstr "生成的动画看起来是这样的:"

msgid ""
"Next, we add the pivot. Because the fish is centered at (0, 0), all we have "
"to do is multiply ``VERTEX`` by a rotation matrix for it to rotate around "
"the center of the fish."
msgstr ""
"接下来，我们添加轴心点。因为鱼以 (0, 0) 为中心，我们所要做的只是将 "
"``VERTEX`` 乘以旋转矩阵，使其围绕鱼的中心旋转。"

msgid "We construct a rotation matrix like so:"
msgstr "我们构造一个旋转矩阵, 如下所示:"

msgid ""
"And then we apply it in the ``x`` and ``z`` axes by multiplying it by "
"``VERTEX.xz``."
msgstr "然后我们把它乘以 ``VERTEX.xz``\\ ，应用到 ``x`` 和 ``z`` 轴上。"

msgid "With only the pivot applied you should see something like this:"
msgstr "在只应用轴心的情况下，你会看到这个："

msgid ""
"The next two motions need to pan down the spine of the fish. For that, we "
"need a new variable, ``body``. ``body`` is a float that is ``0`` at the tail "
"of the fish and ``1`` at its head."
msgstr ""
"接下来的两个动作需要沿着鱼的脊柱平移. 为此, 我们需要一个新的变量, ``body`` . "
"``body`` 是一个浮点数，在鱼的尾部是 ``0`` ，在头部是 ``1`` ."

msgid ""
"The next motion is a cosine wave that moves down the length of the fish. To "
"make it move along the spine of the fish, we offset the input to ``cos`` by "
"the position along the spine, which is the variable we defined above, "
"``body``."
msgstr ""
"下一个运动是沿着鱼的长度向下移动的余弦波. 为了让它沿着鱼的脊柱移动, 我们用脊"
"柱的位置来偏移输入到 ``cos`` 的位置, 也就是我们在上面定义的变量 ``body``\\ 。"

msgid ""
"This looks very similar to the side to side motion we defined above, but in "
"this one, by using ``body`` to offset ``cos`` each vertex along the spine "
"has a different position in the wave making it look like a wave is moving "
"along the fish."
msgstr ""
"这看起来很像我们上面定义的左右运动, 但在这个例子中, 通过使用 ``body`` 来偏移 "
"``cos``\\ ，沿着脊柱的每个顶点在波浪中都有不同的位置, 使它看起来像是沿着鱼移"
"动的波浪."

msgid ""
"The last motion is the twist, which is a panning roll along the spine. "
"Similarly to the pivot, we first construct a rotation matrix."
msgstr ""
"最后一个动作是扭转，也就是沿着脊柱滚动。类似轴心运动，我们首先构造一个旋转矩"
"阵。"

msgid ""
"We apply the rotation in the ``xy`` axes so that the fish appears to roll "
"around its spine. For this to work, the fish's spine needs to be centered on "
"the ``z`` axis."
msgstr ""
"我们在 ``xy`` 轴上应用旋转, 使鱼看起来绕着它的脊柱滚动. 要做到这一点, 鱼的脊"

"If we apply all these motions one after another, we get a fluid jelly-like "
"motion."
msgstr "如果我们一个接一个地应用这些运动, 就得到一个类似液体凝胶似的运动."

msgid ""
"Normal fish swim mostly with the back half of their body. Accordingly, we "
"need to limit the panning motions to the back half of the fish. To do this, "
"we create a new variable, ``mask``."
msgstr ""
"通常鱼主要使用身体的后半部分游泳，所以我们需要将平移运动限制在鱼的后半部分。"
"为此，我们创建一个新变量 ``mask`` （遮罩）。"

msgid ""
"``mask`` is a float that goes from ``0`` at the front of the fish to ``1`` "
"at the end using ``smoothstep`` to control the point at which the transition "
"from ``0`` to ``1`` happens."
msgstr ""
"``mask`` 是个浮点数，从鱼头的 ``0`` 过渡到鱼尾的 ``1`` ，我们用 "

msgstr "下面是把 ``COLOR`` 设置成 ``mask`` 后这条鱼的样子："

msgid ""
"For the wave, we multiply the motion by ``mask`` which will limit it to the "
"back half."
msgstr "我们在做波浪运动的地方乘以 ``mask`` 就可以把动作限制在后半部分。"

msgid ""
"In order to apply the mask to the twist, we use ``mix``. ``mix`` allows us "
"to mix the vertex position between a fully rotated vertex and one that is "
"not rotated. We need to use ``mix`` instead of multiplying ``mask`` by the "
"rotated ``VERTEX`` because we are not adding the motion to the ``VERTEX`` we "
"are replacing the ``VERTEX`` with the rotated version. If we multiplied that "
"by ``mask``, we would shrink the fish."
msgstr ""
"为了将遮罩应用于扭曲, 我们使用 ``mix`` . ``mix`` 允许在完全旋转的顶点和未旋转"
"的顶点之间混合顶点位置. 需要使用 ``mix`` 而不是将 ``mask`` 乘以旋转后的 "
"``VERTEX`` , 因为不是将运动加到 ``VERTEX`` 上, 而是用旋转后的版本替换 "
"``VERTEX`` . 如果把它乘以 ``mask`` , 就会把鱼缩小."

msgid "Putting the four motions together gives us the final animation."
msgstr "将四个动作组合在一起, 就得到了最终的动画效果."

msgid ""
"Go ahead and play with the uniforms in order to alter the swim cycle of the "
"fish. You will find that you can create a wide variety of swim styles using "
"these four motions."
