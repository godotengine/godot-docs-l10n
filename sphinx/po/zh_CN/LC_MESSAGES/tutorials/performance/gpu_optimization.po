"The demand for new graphics features and progress almost guarantees that you "
"will encounter graphics bottlenecks. Some of these can be on the CPU side, "
"for instance in calculations inside the Godot engine to prepare objects for "
"rendering. Bottlenecks can also occur on the CPU in the graphics driver, "
"which sorts instructions to pass to the GPU, and in the transfer of these "
"instructions. And finally, bottlenecks also occur on the GPU itself."

"对新的图形功能和进步的需求几乎可以保证你必会遇到图形瓶颈. 有些瓶颈可能出现在"
"CPU端, 例如在Godot引擎内部的计算中, 为渲染准备对象. 瓶颈也可能发生在CPU上的图"
"形驱动中, 它将指令分类传递给GPU, 以及这些指令的传输过程. 最后, 瓶颈也会发生在"
"GPU本身."

"渲染中的瓶颈发生在哪里, 高度依赖于硬件. 特别是移动GPU可能会在桌面上轻松运行的"
"场景中挣扎."

msgid ""
"Understanding and investigating GPU bottlenecks is slightly different to the "
"situation on the CPU. This is because, often, you can only change "
"performance indirectly by changing the instructions you give to the GPU. "
"Also, it may be more difficult to take measurements. In many cases, the only "
"way of measuring performance is by examining changes in the time spent "
"rendering each frame."
msgstr ""
"了解和调查GPU瓶颈与CPU上的情况略有不同. 这是因为, 通常情况下, 你只能通过改变"
"你给GPU的指令来间接改变性能. 另外, 测量起来可能更困难. 在许多情况下, 衡量性能"

"Godot sends instructions to the GPU via a graphics API (Vulkan, OpenGL, "
"OpenGL ES or WebGL). The communication and driver activity involved can be "
"quite costly, especially in OpenGL, OpenGL ES and WebGL. If we can provide "
"these instructions in a way that is preferred by the driver and GPU, we can "
"greatly increase performance."

msgid ""
"Nearly every API command in OpenGL requires a certain amount of validation "
"to make sure the GPU is in the correct state. Even seemingly simple commands "
"can lead to a flurry of behind-the-scenes housekeeping. Therefore, the goal "
"is to reduce these instructions to a bare minimum and group together similar "
"objects as much as possible so they can be rendered together, or with the "
"minimum number of these expensive state changes."
msgstr ""
"OpenGL中几乎每一个API命令都需要一定的验证, 以确保GPU处于正确的状态. 即使是看"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"In 2D, the costs of treating each item individually can be prohibitively "
"high - there can easily be thousands of them on the screen. This is why 2D "
"*batching* is used with OpenGL-based rendering methods. Multiple similar "
"items are grouped together and rendered in a batch, via a single draw call, "
"rather than making a separate draw call for each item. In addition, this "
"means state changes, material and texture changes can be kept to a minimum."
msgstr ""
"在2D中, 单独处理每个项目的成本可能会非常高--屏幕上很容易有成千上万的项目. 这"
"就是为什么使用2D *批处理* 的原因. 多个类似的项目被归为一组, 并通过一个单一的"
"绘制调用进行批量渲染, 而不是对每个项目进行单独的绘制调用. 此外, 这意味着状态"
"变化, 材质和纹理变化可以保持在最低限度."

msgid ""
"Vulkan-based rendering methods do not use 2D batching yet. Since draw calls "
"are much cheaper with Vulkan compared to OpenGL, there is less of a need to "
"have 2D batching (although it can still be beneficial in some cases)."

msgid "3D batching"
msgstr "3D 批处理"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"In 3D, we still aim to minimize draw calls and state changes. However, it "
"can be more difficult to batch together several objects into a single draw "
"call. 3D meshes tend to comprise hundreds or thousands of triangles, and "
"combining large meshes in real-time is prohibitively expensive. The costs of "
"joining them quickly exceeds any benefits as the number of triangles grows "
"per mesh. A much better alternative is to **join meshes ahead of time** "
"(static meshes in relation to each other). This can be done by artists, or "
"programmatically within Godot using an add-on."
msgstr ""
"在3D中, 我们的目标仍然是尽量减少绘制调用和状态变化. 然而, 将多个对象批量合并"
"到一个绘图调用中可能比较困难.3D网格往往由数百个或数千个三角形组成, 而实时组合"
"大型网格的成本非常高. 随着每个网格的三角形数量的增加, 加入它们的成本很快就超"
"过了带来的好处. 一个更好的选择是 **提前加入网格** (静态网格之间的关系). 这可"
"以由设计师完成, 或者在Godot中以编程方式完成."

msgid ""
"There is also a cost to batching together objects in 3D. Several objects "
"rendered as one cannot be individually culled. An entire city that is off-"
"screen will still be rendered if it is joined to a single blade of grass "
"that is on screen. Thus, you should always take objects' location and "
"culling into account when attempting to batch 3D objects together. Despite "
"this, the benefits of joining static objects often outweigh other "
"considerations, especially for large numbers of distant or low-poly objects."
msgstr ""
"在3D中把物体批处理在一起也是有成本的. 几个对象渲染成一个, 就不能单独剔除. 如"
"果将屏幕外的整座城市与屏幕上的一片草地连接在一起, 那么它仍然会被渲染. 因此, "
"当试图将3D对象批量连接在一起时, 应该始终考虑到对象的位置和剔除. 尽管如此, 加"
"入静态对象的好处往往大于其他考虑因素, 特别是对于大量的远距离或低多边形物体."

"Nowadays, all this is handled inside the GPU, greatly increasing "

"To be more efficient, mobile GPUs attempt to avoid *overdraw*. Overdraw "
"occurs when the same pixel on the screen is being rendered more than once. "
"Imagine a town with several buildings. GPUs don't know what is visible and "
"what is hidden until they draw it. For example, a house might be drawn and "
"then another house in front of it (which means rendering happened twice for "
"the same pixel). PC GPUs normally don't care much about this and just throw "

msgid ""
"Using more power is not an option on mobile so mobile devices use a "
"technique called *tile-based rendering* which divides the screen into a "
"grid. Each cell keeps the list of triangles drawn to it and sorts them by "
"depth to minimize *overdraw*. This technique improves performance and "
"reduces power consumption, but takes a toll on vertex performance. As a "
"result, fewer vertices and triangles can be processed for drawing."

"但对顶点性能造成了影响。因此，可以处理更少的顶点和三角形进行绘制。"

msgid ""
"Additionally, tile-based rendering struggles when there are small objects "
"with a lot of geometry within a small portion of the screen. This forces "
"mobile GPUs to put a lot of strain on a single screen tile, which "

"To summarize, don't worry about vertex count on mobile, but **avoid "
"concentration of vertices in small parts of the screen**. If a character, "
