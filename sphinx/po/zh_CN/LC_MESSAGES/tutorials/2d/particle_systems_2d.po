msgid "Intro"
msgstr "简介"

msgid ""
"A simple (but flexible enough for most uses) particle system is provided. "
"Particle systems are used to simulate complex physical effects, such as "
"sparks, fire, magic particles, smoke, mist, etc."
msgstr ""
"Godot提供了一种简单(但对于大多数用途而言足够灵活)的粒子系统. 粒子系统用于模拟"
"复杂的物理效应, 如火花, 火焰, 魔法粒子, 烟雾, 雾气, 等."

msgid ""
"The idea is that a \"particle\" is emitted at a fixed interval and with a "
"fixed lifetime. During its lifetime, every particle will have the same base "
"behavior. What makes each particle different from the rest and provides a "
"more organic look is the \"randomness\" associated with each parameter. In "
"essence, creating a particle system means setting base physics parameters "
"and then adding randomness to them."
msgstr ""
"这个想法是以固定的间隔发射具有固定的寿命的 \"粒子\". 在其生命周期中, 每个粒子"
"都具有相同的基本行为. 让每个粒子变得不同并提供整体更加 \"有机\" 外观的是与各"
"个参数相关的 \"随机性\". 实质上, 创建粒子系统意味着设置基本物理参数, 然后为它"
"们添加随机性."

msgid "Particle nodes"
msgstr "粒子节点"

msgid ""
"Godot provides two different nodes for 2D particles, :ref:"
"`class_Particles2D` and :ref:`class_CPUParticles2D`. Particles2D is more "
"advanced and uses the GPU to process particle effects, but that limits it to "
"higher end graphics API, and in our case to the GLES3 renderer. For projects "
"using the GLES2 backend, CPUParticles2D is a CPU-driven option with near "
"feature parity with Particles2D, but lesser performance. While Particles2D "
"is configured via a :ref:`class_ParticlesMaterial` (and optionally with a "
"custom shader), the matching options are provided via node properties in "
"CPUParticles2D (with the exception of the trail settings). You can convert a "
"Particles2D node into a CPUParticles2D node by clicking on the node in the "
"inspector, and selecting \"Convert to CPUParticles2D\" in the \"Particles\" "
"menu of the toolbar."
msgstr ""
"Godot 为 2D 粒子提供了两个不同的节点：\\ :ref:`class_Particles2D` 和 :ref:"
"`class_CPUParticles2D`\\ 。Particles2D 更为先进，使用 GPU 处理粒子效果，但这"
"将其限制于相对高端的图形 API 中，在我们的情况下仅限于 GLES3 渲染器。对于使用 "
"GLES2 后端的项目，CPUParticles2D 是一个 CPU 驱动的选项。其功能与 Particles2D "
"接近，但性能较低。Particles2D 是通过 :ref:`class_ParticlesMaterial`\\ （以及"
"可选的自定义 Shader）来配置的，但相应的选项在 CPUParticles2D 中是通过节点属性"
"提供的（轨迹设置除外）。您可以通过单击场景中的节点，然后在工具栏的“粒子”菜单"
"中选择“转换为 CPU 粒子”，将 Particles2D 节点转换为 CPUParticles2D 节点。"

msgid ""
"The rest of this tutorial is going to use the Particles2D node. First, add a "
"Particles2D node to your scene. After creating that node you will notice "
"that only a white dot was created, and that there is a warning icon next to "
"your Particles2D node in the scene dock. This is because the node needs a "
"ParticlesMaterial to function."
msgstr ""
"这个教程后续将使用 Particles2D 节点。首先，添加一个 Particles2D 节点到场景"
"中。在创建该节点后，您会注意到只创建了一个白点，并且在场景面板的 Particles2D "
"节点旁边有一个警告图标。这是因为节点需要 ParticlesMaterial 才能工作。"

msgid "ParticlesMaterial"
msgstr "ParticlesMaterial"

msgid ""
"To add a process material to your particles node, go to ``Process Material`` "
"in your inspector panel. Click on the box next to ``Material``, and from the "

msgstr "Preprocess(预处理)"

msgid ""
"Particle systems begin with zero particles emitted, then start emitting. "
"This can be an inconvenience when loading a scene and systems like a torch, "

"the system process a given number of seconds before it is actually drawn the "
"first time."
msgstr ""
"粒子系统从没有粒子被发射开始, 然后开始发射. 当加载场景如火炬, 雾等系统时可能"
"会带来不便, 因为它会在进入场景的那一刻开始发射. 预处理用于让系统在第一次实际"

msgid "Speed Scale"
msgstr "Speed Scale(速度比例)"

"值会使粒子更快."

msgid "Explosiveness"
msgstr "Explosiveness(爆炸性)"

msgid ""
"If lifetime is ``1`` and there are 10 particles, it means a particle will be "
"emitted every 0.1 seconds. The explosiveness parameter changes this, and "

msgid "Fixed FPS"
msgstr "Fixed FPS(固定帧率)"

msgid ""
"This setting can be used to set the particle system to render at a fixed "
"FPS. For instance, changing the value to ``2`` will make the particles "
"render at 2 frames per second. Note this does not slow down the particle "
"system itself."
msgstr ""
"此设置可用于将粒子系统设置为以固定的帧率渲染. 例如, 将值更改为 ``2`` 将使粒子"

"幕上渲染粒子."

msgid ""
"The rectangle's ``W`` and ``H`` properties respectively control its Width "
"and its Height. The ``X`` and ``Y`` properties control the position of the "
"upper-left corner of the rectangle, relative to the particle emitter."
msgstr ""

"上角相对于粒子发射器的位置."

msgid ""
"You can have Godot generate a Visibility Rect automatically using the "
"toolbar above the 2d view. To do so, select the Particles2D node and Click "

"emitted to is relative to the node. If the node is moved, all particles are "
"moved with it:"
msgstr ""
"默认情况下, 此选项处于启用状态, 这意味着粒子发射的空间是相对于节点来算的. 如"
