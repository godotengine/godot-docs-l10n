"Godot has nodes to draw sprites, polygons, particles, and all sorts of "
"stuff. For most cases, this is enough. If there's no node to draw something "
"specific you need, you can make any 2D node (for example, :ref:`Control "
"<class_Control>` or :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` based) draw custom commands."
msgstr ""
"Godot 有用于绘制精灵、多边形、粒子以及各种东西的节点。在大多数情况下，这就已"
"经足够了，但并不总是这样。可别因为不存在绘制\\ *某种特定*\\ 东西的节点，而在"

"Custom drawing in a 2D node is *really* useful. Here are some use cases:"
msgstr "2D 节点中的自定义绘制\\ *非常*\\ 有用。下面是一些用例："

msgid ""
"Drawing shapes or logic that existing nodes can't do, such as an image with "
"trails or a special animated polygon."
msgstr ""
"绘制现有节点类型无法完成的形状或逻辑，例如带有轨迹或特殊动态多边形的图像。"

msgid ""
"Visualizations that are not that compatible with nodes, such as a tetris "
"board. (The tetris example uses a custom draw function to draw the blocks.)"
msgstr ""
"与节点不太兼容的呈现方式，比如俄罗斯方块的棋盘。（俄罗斯方块的例子使用的是自"

msgid ""
"Drawing a large number of simple objects. Custom drawing avoids the overhead "
"of using a large number of nodes, possibly lowering memory usage and "
"improving performance."
msgstr ""
"绘制大量简单的对象。自定义绘制避免了使用大量节点的开销，能降低内存占用，并提"
"高性能。"

msgid ""
"Making a custom UI control. There are plenty of controls available, but when "
"you have unusual needs, you will likely need a custom control."
msgstr "制作自定义的 UI 控件，以满足很多可用的控件之外的特别需求。"

msgid "Drawing"
msgstr "绘制"

msgid ""
"Add a script to any :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` derived node, like :"
"ref:`Control <class_Control>` or :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>`. Then override "
"the ``_draw()`` function."
msgstr ""
"添加一个脚本到任何 :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` 的派生节点，如 :ref:"
"`Control <class_Control>` 或 :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>`\\ 。然后重载 "

"Draw commands are described in the :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` "
"class reference. There are plenty of them."
msgstr ""
"绘制命令在 :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` 的类参考中有所描述，数量很"
"多。"

msgid "Updating"
msgstr "更新"

msgid ""
"The ``_draw()`` function is only called once, and then the draw commands are "
"cached and remembered, so further calls are unnecessary."
msgstr ""
"``_draw()`` 函数只调用一次, 然后绘制命令被缓存并记住, 因此不需要进一步调用."

"If re-drawing is required because a state or something else changed, call :"

"that same node and a new ``_draw()`` call will happen."
msgstr ""
"如果因为状态或其他方面的变化而需要重新绘制，在当前节点中调用 :ref:"

"在某些情况下, 可能需要绘制每一帧. 为此, 只需从 ``_process()`` 回调调用 "
"``update()`` , 如下所示:"

msgid "Coordinates"
msgstr "坐标"

msgid ""
"The drawing API uses the CanvasItem's coordinate system, not necessarily "
"pixel coordinates. Which means it uses the coordinate space created after "
"applying the CanvasItem's transform. Additionally, you can apply a custom "
"transform on top of it by using :ref:"

msgid "An example: drawing circular arcs"
msgstr "示例：绘制圆弧"

msgid ""
"We will now use the custom drawing functionality of the Godot Engine to draw "
"something that Godot doesn't provide functions for. As an example, Godot "
"provides a ``draw_circle()`` function that draws a whole circle. However, "
"what about drawing a portion of a circle? You will have to code a function "
"to perform this and draw it yourself."
msgstr ""
"我们现在将使用 Godot 引擎的自定义绘图功能来绘制 Godot 未提供函数的内容。比"

"圆的一部分怎么说？你必须编写一个函数来执行此操作，自己绘制它。"

msgid "Arc function"
msgstr "弧函数"

msgid ""
"An arc is defined by its support circle parameters, that is, the center "
"position and the radius. The arc itself is then defined by the angle it "
"starts from and the angle at which it stops. These are the 4 arguments that "
"we have to provide to our drawing function. We'll also provide the color "
"value, so we can draw the arc in different colors if we wish."
msgstr ""
"弧由其所在的圆的参数定义. 即: 中心位置和半径. 弧本身由开始的角度和停止的角度"
"来定义. 这些是我们必须为绘图提供的4个参数. 我们还将提供颜色值, 因此我们可以根"

"Basically, drawing a shape on the screen requires it to be decomposed into a "
"certain number of points linked from one to the next. As you can imagine, "
"the more points your shape is made of, the smoother it will appear, but the "
"heavier it will also be in terms of processing cost. In general, if your "
"shape is huge (or in 3D, close to the camera), it will require more points "
"to be drawn without it being angular-looking. On the contrary, if your shape "
"is small (or in 3D, far from the camera), you may decrease its number of "
"points to save processing costs; this is known as *Level of Detail (LOD)*. "
"In our example, we will simply use a fixed number of points, no matter the "
"radius."
msgstr ""
"基本上, 在屏幕上绘制形状需要将其分解为一定量首位相接的点. 你可以预见到, 点越"
"多, 它就越平滑, 但处理开销就越大. 一般来说, 如果你的形状很大(或者在3D场景中靠"
"近相机), 则需要绘制更多的点才不会看起来像是有棱角的. 相反, 如果你的形状很小"
"(或在3D场景里远离相机), 你可以减少其点数以节省处理成本. 这称为 *多层次细节"
"(Level of Detail, LoD)* . 在我们的示例中, 无论半径如何, 我们都只使用固定数量"
"的点."

"Remember the number of points our shape has to be decomposed into? We fixed "
"this number in the ``nb_points`` variable to a value of ``32``. Then, we "
"initialize an empty ``PackedVector2Array``, which is simply an array of "
"``Vector2``\\ s."
msgstr ""
"还记得我们的形状必须分解成成的点的数量吗？ 我们将 ``nb_points`` 变量中的这个"
"数字修改为32. 然后, 我们初始化一个空的 ``PoolVector2Array`` , 就是一个Vector2"
"数组."

msgid ""
"The next step consists of computing the actual positions of these 32 points "
"that compose an arc. This is done in the first for-loop: we iterate over the "
"number of points for which we want to compute the positions, plus one to "
"include the last point. We first determine the angle of each point, between "
"the starting and ending angles."
msgstr ""
"下一步包括计算构成弧的这32个点的实际位置. 这是在第一个for循环中完成的: 我们迭"
"代我们想要计算位置的点的数量, 后面+1来包括最后一个点. 我们首先确定起点和终点"
"之间每个点的角度."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The reason why each angle is decreased by 90° is that we will compute 2D "
"positions out of each angle using trigonometry (you know, cosine and sine "
"stuff...). However, ``cos()`` and ``sin()`` use radians, not degrees. The "
"angle of 0° (0 radian) starts at 3 o'clock, although we want to start "
"counting at 12 o'clock. So we decrease each angle by 90° in order to start "
"counting from 12 o'clock."
msgstr ""
"每个角度减小90°的原因是我们将使用三角函数计算每个角度的2D位置(你知道, 余弦和"
"正弦之类的东西......). 但是, 为了简单, ``cos()`` 和 ``sin()`` 使用弧度, 而不"
"是度数作为参数. 虽然我们想在12点钟位置开始计数, 但0°(0弧度)的角度从3点钟位置"
"开始. 因此我们将每个角度减小90°, 以便从12点位置开始计数."

msgid ""
"The actual position of a point located on a circle at angle ``angle`` (in "
"radians) is given by ``Vector2(cos(angle), sin(angle))``. Since ``cos()`` "
"and ``sin()`` return values between -1 and 1, the position is located on a "
"circle of radius 1. To have this position on our support circle, which has a "
"radius of ``radius``, we simply need to multiply the position by ``radius``. "
"Finally, we need to position our support circle at the ``center`` position, "
"which is performed by adding it to our ``Vector2`` value. Finally, we insert "
"the point in the ``PackedVector2Array`` which was previously defined."
msgstr ""
"以角度 ``angle`` (单位是弧度)位于圆上的点的实际位置由 ``Vector2(cos(angle), "
"sin(angle))`` 给出. 由于 ``cos()`` 和 ``sin()`` 返回介于-1和1之间的值, 因此位"
"置位于半径为1的圆上. 要将此位置放在我们的半径为 ``radius`` 的辅助圆上, 我们只"
"需要将那个位置乘以 ``radius`` . 最后, 我们需要将我们的辅助圆定位在 "
"``center`` 位置, 这是通过将其与我们的 ``Vector2`` 相加来实现的. 最后, 我们在"
"之前定义的 ``PoolVector2Array`` 中插入这个点."

msgid ""
"Now, we need to actually draw our points. As you can imagine, we will not "
"simply draw our 32 points: we need to draw everything that is between each "
"of them. We could have computed every point ourselves using the previous "
"method, and drew it one by one. But this is too complicated and inefficient "
"(except if explicitly needed), so we simply draw lines between each pair of "
"points. Unless the radius of our support circle is big, the length of each "
"line between a pair of points will never be long enough to see them. If that "
"were to happen, we would simply need to increase the number of points."
msgstr ""
"现在, 我们需要实际绘制我们的点. 你可以想象, 我们不会简单地画出我们的32个点: "
"我们需要绘制每一点之间的所有内容. 我们可以使用前面的方法自己计算每个点, 然后"
"逐个绘制. 但这太复杂和低效了(除非确实需要). 因此, 我们只需在每对点之间绘制线"
"条. 除非我们的辅助圆的半径很大, 否则一对点之间每条线的长度永远不会长到足以看"
"到它们. 如果发生这种情况, 我们只需要增加点的个数就可以了."

"The reason is that your GPU is actually displaying the frames as fast as it "
"can. We need to \"normalize\" the drawing by this speed; to achieve that, we "
"have to make use of the ``delta`` parameter of the ``_process()`` function. "
"``delta`` contains the time elapsed between the two last rendered frames. It "
"is generally small (about 0.0003 seconds, but this depends on your "
"hardware), so using ``delta`` to control your drawing ensures that your "
"program runs at the same speed on everybody's hardware."
