"In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create 2D animated characters with the "
"AnimatedSprite class and the AnimationPlayer. Typically, when you create or "
"download an animated character, it will come in one of two ways: as "
"individual images or as a single sprite sheet containing all the animation's "
"frames. Both can be animated in Godot with the AnimatedSprite class."
msgstr ""
"在本教程中，你将学习如何使用 AnimatedSprite（动画精灵）类和 AnimationPlayer "
"来创建 2D 动画角色。无论是自己绘制还是直接下载现成的，拿到的动画角色资产一般"
"就是两种形式：一系列单独的图片，或者一张包含所有动画帧的精灵表（Sprite "
"Sheet）。两者都可以使用 Godot 的 AnimatedSprite 类进行动画。"

msgid ""
"First, we'll use :ref:`AnimatedSprite <class_AnimatedSprite>` to animate a "
"collection of individual images. Then we will animate a sprite sheet using "
"this class. Finally, we will learn another way to animate a sprite sheet "
"with :ref:`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>` and the *Animation* "
"property of :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>`."
msgstr ""
"我们首先会用 :ref:`AnimatedSprite <class_AnimatedSprite>` 来把一系列单独的图"
"片做成动画，然后我们再会这个类来把精灵表做成动画，最后我们还会学习使用 :ref:"
"`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>` 和 :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` 的 "
"*Animation*\\ （动画）属性来把精灵表做成动画。"

"The root node could also be :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` or :ref:"

msgstr ""
"根节点也可以是 :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` 或 :ref:`RigidBody2D "

msgstr ""

"<class_AnimationPlayer>`."
msgstr ""
"在使用精灵表时，另一种方法是使用标准的 :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` 节点来显"

msgstr ""
"将精灵表拖拽到 Sprite 的 *Texture* 属性里，你会看到整个清单显示在屏幕上。要把"
"它分割成单独的帧，请在“检查器”中展开 *Animation* 部分，将 *Hframes* 设置为 "

msgid "Controlling an AnimationPlayer animation"
msgstr "控制 AnimationPlayer 动画"

"animation while the right arrow key is held, and stop it when the key is "
"released."
msgstr ""
"正如AnimationSprite一样, 你可以通过代码中的 ``play()`` 和 ``stop()`` 方法控制"
"动画. 同样, 这里有一个简单的例子, 按住右方向键键播放动画, 松开后就停下."

msgid ""
"If updating both an animation and a separate property at once (for example, "
"a platformer may update the sprite's ``h_flip``/``v_flip`` properties when a "
"character turns while starting a 'turning' animation), it's important to "
"keep in mind that ``play()`` isn't applied instantly. Instead, it's applied "
"the next time the :ref:`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>` is "
"processed. This may end up being on the next frame, causing a 'glitch' "
"frame, where the property change was applied but the animation was not. If "
"this turns out to be a problem, after calling ``play()``, you can call "
"``advance(0)`` to update the animation immediately."
msgstr ""
"如果同时更新一个动画和一个其他的属性（比如说，平台跳跃游戏可能会更新精灵的 "
"``h_flip``/``v_flip`` 属性然后同时开始一个转身动画“turning”），要记住 "
"``play()`` 不是即时生效的。它会在下次 :ref:`AnimationPlayer "
"<class_AnimationPlayer>` 被处理时生效。也就是说可能要到下一帧才行，导致现在这"
"一帧变成“问题”帧——应用了属性的变化，但动画还没有开始。如果这会造成麻烦的话，"
"在调用 ``play()`` 后，你可以调用 ``advance(0)`` 来立即开始播放动画。"

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "总结"

msgid ""
"These examples illustrate the two classes you can use in Godot for 2D "
"animation. ``AnimationPlayer`` is a bit more complex than "
"``AnimatedSprite``, but it provides additional functionality, since you can "
"also animate other properties like position or scale. The class "
"``AnimationPlayer`` can also be used with an ``AnimatedSprite``. Experiment "
"to see what works best for your needs."
msgstr ""
"以上的例子演示了使用 Godot 提供的两个类来制作 2D 动画的方法。 "
"``AnimationPlayer`` 相比 ``AnimatedSprite`` 而言略显复杂，但同时也提供了更多"
"的功能，因为你还可以同时动画位置和缩放之类的其它的属性。 ``AnimationPlayer`` "
"也可以和 ``AnimatedSprite`` 配合使用，你可以自己试一试，看看怎样的做法更适合"
"你自己。"
