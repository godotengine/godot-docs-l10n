"In 3D, meshes are used to display the world. In 2D, they are rare as images "
"are used more often. Godot's 2D engine is a pure two-dimensional engine, so "
"it can't really display 3D meshes directly (although it can be done via "
"``Viewport`` and ``ViewportTexture``)."
msgstr ""
"在 3D 中，网格用于显示世界。在 2D 中它们不常见，因为图片使用得更频繁。Godot "
"的 2D 部分是一个纯 2D 引擎，因此它不能直接显示 3D 网格（尽管它可以通过 "
"``Viewport`` 和 ``ViewportTexture`` 来实现）。"

"If you are interested in displaying 3D meshes on a 2D viewport, see the :ref:"
"`doc_viewport_as_texture` tutorial."

"`doc_viewport_as_texture` 教程."

"2D meshes are meshes that contain two-dimensional geometry (Z can be omitted "
"or ignored) instead of 3D. You can experiment creating them yourself using "
"``SurfaceTool`` from code and displaying them in a ``MeshInstance2D`` node."
msgstr ""
"2D 网格是包含二维几何（Z 轴可以省略或忽略）而不是三维几何的网格。你可以尝试使"
"用代码中的 ``SurfaceTool`` 创建它们，并在 ``MeshInstance2D`` 节点中显示它们。"

msgid ""
"Currently, the only way to generate a 2D mesh within the editor is by either "
"importing an OBJ file as a mesh, or converting it from a Sprite2D."
msgstr ""
"目前，在编辑器中生成 2D 网格的唯一方法是导入 OBJ 文件作为网格，或者从 "
"Sprite2D 转换而来。"

msgid "Optimizing pixels drawn"
msgstr "优化绘制的像素"

"This workflow is useful for optimizing 2D drawing in some situations. When "
"drawing large images with transparency, Godot will draw the whole quad to "
"the screen. The large transparent areas will still be drawn."
msgstr ""
"在某些情况下, 这个工作流程对于优化二维绘图比较有用. 当绘制具有透明度的大型图"
"像时,Godot将把整个四方形(quad)绘制到屏幕上. 大片的透明区域还是会被绘制."

msgid ""
"This can affect performance, especially on mobile devices, when drawing very "
"large images (generally screen sized), or layering multiple images on top of "
"each other with large transparent areas (for example, when using "
"``ParallaxBackground``)."
msgstr ""
"如果绘制非常大的图像时（大概屏幕大小），或者将多个有大透明区域的图像叠加在一"
"起（例如使用 ``ParallaxBackground`` 时），这会影响性能，尤其是在移动设备上。"

msgid ""
"Converting to a mesh will ensure that only the opaque parts will be drawn "
"and the rest will be ignored."
msgstr "转换成网格能确保只绘制不透明部分, 其余部分被忽略."

msgid "Converting Sprite2Ds to 2D meshes"
msgstr "将 Sprite2D 转换为 2D 网格"

msgid ""
"You can take advantage of this optimization by converting a ``Sprite2D`` to "
"a ``MeshInstance2D``. Start with an image that contains large amounts of "
"transparency on the edges, like this tree:"
msgstr ""
"你可以通过把 ``Sprite2D`` 转换为 ``MeshInstance2D`` 的方法来利用这种优化。从"
"边缘有大量透明的图片开始，就像这棵树："

msgid ""
"Put it in a ``Sprite2D`` and select \"Convert to 2D Mesh\" from the menu:"
msgstr "把它放到一个 ``Sprite2D`` 中，从菜单选择“转换为 2D 网格”："

msgid ""
"A dialog will appear, showing a preview of how the 2D mesh will be created:"
msgstr "会出现一个对话框, 显示将要创建的二维网格预览:"

msgid ""
"The default values are good enough for many cases, but you can change growth "
"and simplification according to your needs:"
msgstr ""
"很多情况下, 默认值已经足够好, 但是你可以根据需要改变growth(增长)和"
"simplication(简化):"

"Finally, push the ``Convert 2D Mesh`` button and your Sprite2D will be "
