"In OpenXR, it is standard for each runtime to implement a mechanism to make "
"it the current runtime. In Steam, the Oculus application or Windows MR "
"portal, there will be an option to switch to their runtime as the current "
"OpenXR runtime."
msgstr ""
"在 OpenXR 中，标准要求各个运行时环境自行实现让自身成为当前运行时的机制。在 "
"Stream、Oculus 应用、Windows MR 门户中，都有用于将它们的运行时设为当前 "
"OpenXR 运行时的选项。"

msgid ""
"Generally speaking, end users will have a preferred runtime due to not "
"having a reason to switch runtimes when playing games that support OpenXR. "
"However, developers may wish to test multiple runtimes to see if their game "
"behaves."
msgstr ""
"一般来说，最终用户会有首选的运行时，因为没有理由在游玩 OpenXR 游戏的过程中切"
"换运行时。然而，开发者可能希望测试多个运行时环境，查看他们的游戏是否正常。"

"To make this easy, Godot provides a dropdown in the top-right corner which "
"can switch the runtime Godot will use when testing:"
msgstr ""
"为了简化这个过程，Godot 在右上角提供了一个下拉菜单，可以用来切换测试时 Godot "
"所使用的运行时："

msgid ""
"The OpenXR plugin will **not** work with the Microsoft MR runtime. That "
"runtime only supports OpenXR applications that use DirectX, but Godot uses "
"OpenGL ES 3.0 or 2.0."
msgstr ""
"OpenXR 插件\\ **无法**\\ 使用微软 MR 运行时。该运行时仅支持使用 DirectX 的 "
"OpenXR 应用，但是 Godot 使用的是 OpenGL ES 3.0 和 2.0。"

msgid ""
"Selecting a runtime in this dropdown only applies to running the game from "
"the editor. It does **not** change the runtime used by other applications. "
"Exported projects will use the computers current runtime. Also, if you are "
"deploying to an external device, this setting has no effect."
msgstr ""
"在这个下拉菜单中选择的运行时只会影响从编辑器中运行的游戏，\\ **不会**\\ 修改"
"其他应用程序所使用的运行时。导出后的项目会使用电脑上的当前运行时环境。此外，"
"如果你是部署到外部设备的，那么这个设置不会生效。"

msgid ""
"As OpenXR doesn't have a mechanism for registering runtimes that we can "
"query, Godot will check common locations for runtime configuration files. "
"The locations that are checked are stored in the ``addons/godot_openxr/"
"runtimes.json`` file. If you've installed a runtime in a nonstandard "
"location or a runtime not currently present in this file, you can add it "
"manually using a text editor."
msgstr ""
"因为 OpenXR 没有注册运行时环境的机制，我们无法进行查询，Godot 会检查常见的运"
"行时配置文件的位置。检查的位置保存在 ``addons/godot_openxr/runtimes.json`` 文"
"件中。如果你把运行时安装在了非标准位置，或者某个运行时没有在这个文件中列出，"
"你可以使用文本编辑器手动添加。"

msgid ""
"If the dropdown isn't shown in your editor, make sure the plugin is enabled. "
"See :ref:`doc_enable_plugin`."
msgstr ""
"如果你的编辑器中没有显示这个下拉菜单，请确保该插件已启用。请参阅 :ref:"
"`doc_enable_plugin`\\ 。"
