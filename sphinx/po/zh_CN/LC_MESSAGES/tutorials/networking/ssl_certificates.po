"It is often desired to use SSL connections for communications to avoid \"man "
"in the middle\" attacks. Godot has a connection wrapper, :ref:`StreamPeerTLS "
"<class_StreamPeerTLS>`, which can take a regular connection and add security "
"around it. The :ref:`HTTPClient <class_HTTPClient>` class also supports "
"HTTPS by using this same wrapper."

"Godot includes SSL certificates from Mozilla, but you can provide your own "
"with a .crt file in the project settings:"
msgstr ""
"Godot包括了来自Mozilla的SSL证书, 但你可以在项目设置中用.crt文件提供你自己的:"

"This file should contain any number of public certificates in `PEM format "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail>`__."
msgstr ""
"该文件应包含任意数量的 `PEM 格式的公共证书 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail>`__ ."

msgid ""
"Of course, remember to add .crt as filter so the exporter recognizes this "
"when exporting your project."
msgstr "当然, 请记住将.crt添加为过滤器, 以便导出器在导出项目时识别这一点."

msgid "There are two ways to obtain certificates:"
msgstr "获取证书有两种方法:"

msgid "Approach 1: self signed cert"
msgstr "方法 1：自签名证书"

msgid ""
"The first approach is the simplest: generate a private and public key pair "
"and add the public key (in PEM format) to the .crt file. The private key "
"should go to your server."
msgstr ""
"第一种方法最简单: 生成一个私钥和公钥对, 并将公钥(PEM格式)添加到.crt文件中. 私"
"钥应该放到你的服务器上."

msgid ""
"OpenSSL has `some documentation <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openssl/"
"openssl/master/doc/HOWTO/keys.txt>`__ about this. This approach also **does "
"not require domain validation** nor requires you to spend a considerable "
"amount of money in purchasing certificates from a CA."
msgstr ""
"OpenSSL有 `一些文档 <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openssl/openssl/"
"master/doc/HOWTO/keys.txt>`__ 谈到这些. 这种方法也 **不需要域名验证** 也不要"
"求你花费现金从CA购买证书."

msgid "Approach 2: CA cert"
msgstr "方法 2：CA 证书"

msgid ""
"The second approach consists of using a certificate authority (CA) such as "
"Verisign, Geotrust, etc. This is a more cumbersome process, but it's more "
"\"official\" and ensures your identity is clearly represented."
msgstr ""
"第二种方法是借助 Verisign、Geotrust 等证书颁发机构（CA）。这是一个更加繁琐的"
"过程，但它更加“正式”并且可以确保你的身份被清晰地表示。"

msgid ""
"Unless you are working with large companies or corporations, or need to "
"connect to someone else's servers (i.e., connecting to Google or some other "
"REST API provider via HTTPS), this method is not as useful."
msgstr ""
"除非你与大公司或企业合作, 或需要连接到别人的服务器(即通过HTTPS连接到谷歌或其"
"他REST API供应商), 否则这种方法就不那么有用."

msgid ""
"Also, when using a CA issued cert, **you must enable domain validation**, to "
"ensure the domain you are connecting to is the one intended, otherwise any "
"website can issue any certificate in the same CA and it will work."
msgstr ""
"此外, 当使用CA颁发的证书时, **你必须启用域名验证** , 以确保你要连接的域名是你"
"想连接的域名, 否则一个CA颁发的证书将会成功用到任意数量的网站中."

msgid ""
"If you are using Linux, you can use the supplied certs file, generally "
"located in:"
msgstr "如果你使用的是Linux, 则可以使用系统提供的证书文件, 通常位于:"

msgid ""
"This file allows HTTPS connections to virtually any website (i.e., Google, "
"Microsoft, etc.)."
msgstr "此文件允许HTTPS连接到几乎任何网站(即Google,Microsoft等)."

msgid ""
"Or pick any of the more specific certificates there if you are connecting to "
"a specific one."
msgstr "或者, 如果要连接到特定网站, 请选择任何更加具体的证书."
