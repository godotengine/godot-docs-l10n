"The WebSocket protocol was standardized in 2011 with the original goal of "
"allowing browsers to create stable and bidirectional connections with a "
"server. Before that, browsers used to only support HTTPRequests, which is "
"not well-suited for bidirectional communication."

"The protocol is message based and a very powerful tool to send push "
"notifications to browsers, and has been used to implement chats, turn-based "
"games, etc. It still uses a TCP connection, which is good for reliability "
"but not for latency, so not good for real-time applications like VoIP and "
"fast-paced games (see :ref:`WebRTC <doc_webrtc>` for those use cases)."
msgstr ""
"这个协议相当简单, 基于消息, 是一个非常强大的向浏览器推送通知的工具, 已经被用"
"来实现聊天, 回合制游戏等. 它仍使用TCP连接, 这对可靠性有好处, 但对延迟没有好"
"处, 所以不适合实时的应用, 比如VoIP和快节奏的游戏(这些用例见 :ref:`WebRTC "
"<doc_webrtc>`)."

"Due to its simplicity, its wide compatibility, and being easier to use than "
"a raw TCP connection, WebSocket soon started to spread outside the browsers, "
"in native applications as a mean to communicate with network servers."
msgstr ""
"由于它的简单性, 广泛的兼容性以及比原始TCP连接更容易使用,WebSocket很快就开始在"
