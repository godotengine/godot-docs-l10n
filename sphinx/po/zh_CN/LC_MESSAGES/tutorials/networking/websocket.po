"The WebSocket protocol was standardized in 2011 with the original goal of "
"allowing browsers to create stable and bidirectional connections with a "
"server. Before that, browsers used to only support HTTPRequests, which is "
"not well-suited for bidirectional communication."
msgstr ""
"WebSocket协议在2011年被标准化, 最初的目标是让浏览器与服务器建立稳定的双向连"
"接. 在此之前, 浏览器曾只支持HTTPRequests, 并不适合双向通信."

msgid ""
"The protocol is quite simple, message based, and a very powerful tool to "
"send push notifications to browsers, and has been used to implement chats, "
"turn-based games, etc. It still uses a TCP connection, which is good for "
"reliability but not for latency, so not good for real-time applications like "
"VoIP and fast-paced games (see :ref:`WebRTC <doc_webrtc>` for those use "
"cases)."
msgstr ""
"这个协议相当简单, 基于消息, 是一个非常强大的向浏览器推送通知的工具, 已经被用"
"来实现聊天, 回合制游戏等. 它仍使用TCP连接, 这对可靠性有好处, 但对延迟没有好"
"处, 所以不适合实时的应用, 比如VoIP和快节奏的游戏(这些用例见 :ref:`WebRTC "
"<doc_webrtc>`)."

"Due to its simplicity, its wide compatibility, and being easier to use than "
"a raw TCP connection, WebSocket soon started to spread outside the browsers, "
"in native applications as a mean to communicate with network servers."
msgstr ""
"由于它的简单性, 广泛的兼容性以及比原始TCP连接更容易使用,WebSocket很快就开始在"
"浏览器以外的地方应用, 在本地应用程序中作为与网络服务器通信的一种手段."

"When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the ``INTERNET`` permission "
