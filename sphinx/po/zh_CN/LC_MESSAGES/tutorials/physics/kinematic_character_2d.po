"Yes, the name sounds strange. \"Kinematic Character\". What is that? The "
"reason for the name is that, when physics engines came out, they were called "
"\"Dynamics\" engines (because they dealt mainly with collision responses). "
"Many attempts were made to create a character controller using the dynamics "
"engines, but it wasn't as easy as it seemed. Godot has one of the best "
"implementations of dynamic character controller you can find (as it can be "
"seen in the 2d/platformer demo), but using it requires a considerable level "
"of skill and understanding of physics engines (or a lot of patience with "
"trial and error)."
msgstr ""
"是的，名字听起来很奇怪。“运动学角色”是什么东西？使用这个名称的原因是物理引擎"
"问世之处，它们被称为“动力学（Dynamics）”引擎（因为它们主要处理碰撞响应）。人"
"们做了许多尝试，想使用动力学引擎创建角色控制器，但它并不像看起来那么容易。"
"Godot 拥有你能找到的最好的动力学角色控制器（可以在 2d/platformer 演示中查"
"看），但使用它需要相当高水平的技能和对物理引擎的理解（或者对试验和试错有足够"
"的耐心）。"

"Some physics engines, such as Havok seem to swear by dynamic character "
"controllers as the best option, while others (PhysX) would rather promote "
"the kinematic one."
msgstr ""
"像 Havok 这样的物理引擎似乎认为力学角色控制器是最好的选择，而其他物理引擎"
"（PhysX）则更愿意推广运动学（Kinematic）的角色控制器。"

msgid "So, what is the difference?:"
msgstr "那么区别是什么呢？："

"A **dynamic character controller** uses a rigid body with an infinite "
"inertia tensor. It's a rigid body that can't rotate. Physics engines always "
"let objects move and collide, then solve their collisions all together. This "
"makes dynamic character controllers able to interact with other physics "
"objects seamlessly, as seen in the platformer demo. However, these "
"interactions are not always predictable. Collisions can take more than one "
"frame to be solved, so a few collisions may seem to displace a tiny bit. "
"Those problems can be fixed, but require a certain amount of skill."
msgstr ""
"**动力学角色控制器**\\ 使用的是一个具有无限惯性张量的刚体。这是一个不能旋转的"
"刚体. 物理引擎总是让物体移动和碰撞, 然后一并解决它们的碰撞. 这使得动态角色控"
"制器能够与其他物理对象无缝交互, 就像在平台游戏演示中看到的那样. 然而, 这些互"
"动并不总是可预测的. 碰撞可能需要多于一帧的时间来解决, 所以几个碰撞可能看起来"
"会有很小的位移. 这些问题是可以解决的, 但需要一定的技巧."

msgid ""
"A **kinematic character controller** is assumed to always begin in a non-"
"colliding state, and will always move to a non-colliding state. If it starts "
"in a colliding state, it will try to free itself like rigid bodies do, but "
"this is the exception, not the rule. This makes their control and motion a "
"lot more predictable and easier to program. However, as a downside, they "
"can't directly interact with other physics objects, unless done by hand in "
"code."
msgstr ""
"**运动学角色控制器**\\ 总是假设以非碰撞状态开始，并将总是移动到非碰撞状态。如"
"果它开始时处于碰撞状态, 将像刚体一样尝试释放自己, 但这是特例, 而不是规则. 这"
"使得它们的控制和运动更可预测, 更容易编程. 然而, 有一个缺点, 它们不能直接与其"
"他物理对象交互, 除非在代码中手动完成."

"This short tutorial focuses on the kinematic character controller. It uses "
"the old-school way of handling collisions, which is not necessarily simpler "
"under the hood, but well hidden and presented as an API."

"这个简短的教程将重点介绍运动学角色控制器。基本上，传统处理冲突的方法（它并不"

msgid "Physics process"
msgstr "物理过程处理"

msgid ""
"To manage the logic of a kinematic body or character, it is always advised "
"to use physics process, because it's called before physics step and its "
"execution is in sync with physics server, also it is called the same amount "
"of times per second, always. This makes physics and motion calculation work "
"in a more predictable way than using regular process, which might have "
"spikes or lose precision if the frame rate is too high or too low."
msgstr ""
"为了管理运动物体或角色的逻辑, 总是建议使用物理过程处理, 因为它在物理步骤之前"
"被调用并且它的执行与物理服务器同步, 它也被以被每秒相同的次数调用. 这使得物理"
"和运动计算以比使用常规过程处理更可预测的方式工作, 如果帧速率太高或太低, 则可"
"能具有尖峰或丢失精度."

"You'll notice that there's a warning icon next to our CollisionShape2D node; "
"that's because we haven't defined a shape for it. Create a new CircleShape2D "
"in the shape property of CollisionShape2D. Click on <CircleShape2D> to go to "
"the options for it, and set the radius to 30:"
msgstr ""
"你会注意到, 在 \"二维碰撞形状 \"(CollisionShape2D)节点旁边有一个警告图标；那"

"中创建一个新的二维圆形形状(CircleShape2D). 点击 <二维圆形形状>(CircleShape2D)"
"进入选项, 将半径设置为30:"

msgid ""
"**Note: As mentioned before in the physics tutorial, the physics engine "
"can't handle scale on most types of shapes (only collision polygons, planes "
"and segments work), so always change the parameters (such as radius) of the "
"shape instead of scaling it. The same is also true for the kinematic/rigid/"
"static bodies themselves, as their scale affects the shape scale.**"
msgstr ""
"**注意: 正如之前在物理教程中提到的, 物理引擎无法处理大多数类型形状的缩放, 只"
"有碰撞多边形, 平面和段才有效, 所以, 总是改变形状的半径等参数, 而不是缩放它. "
"对于运动体或刚性体或静态体本身也是如此, 因为它们的比例会影响形状的比例.**"
