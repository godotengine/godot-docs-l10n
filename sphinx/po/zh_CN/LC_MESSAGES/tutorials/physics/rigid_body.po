msgid ""
"A rigid body is one that is directly controlled by the physics engine in "
"order to simulate the behavior of physical objects. In order to define the "
"shape of the body, it must have one or more :ref:`Shape <class_Shape>` "
"objects assigned. Note that setting the position of these shapes will affect "
"the body's center of mass."
msgstr ""
"刚体是直接由物理引擎控制以模拟物理对象行为的物体. 为了定义物体的形状, 必须分"
"配一个或多个 :ref:`Shape <class_Shape>` 对象. 注意, 设置这些形状的位置将影响"
"物体的重心."

msgid "How to control a rigid body"
msgstr "如何控制刚体"

msgid ""
"A rigid body's behavior can be altered by setting its properties, such as "
"mass and weight. A physics material needs to be added to the rigid body to "
"adjust its friction and bounce, and set if it's absorbent and/or rough. "
"These properties can be set in the Inspector or via code. See :ref:"
"`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` and :ref:`PhysicsMaterial "
"<class_PhysicsMaterial>` for the full list of properties and their effects."
msgstr ""
"刚体的行为可以通过设置其属性来改变，比如质量和重量。需要给刚体添加一个物理材"
"质来调整它的摩擦力和反弹力，并设置它是否具有吸收性、粗糙度。这些属性可以在检"
"查器中或通过代码来设置。参见 :ref:`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` 和 :ref:"
"`PhysicsMaterial <class_PhysicsMaterial>` 获取完整的属性列表和它们的效果。"

msgid ""
"There are several ways to control a rigid body's movement, depending on your "
"desired application."
msgstr "有几种方法可以控制刚体的运动, 这取决于您的应用程序."

msgid ""
"If you only need to place a rigid body once, for example to set its initial "
"location, you can use the methods provided by the :ref:`Spatial "
"<class_Spatial>` node, such as ``set_global_transform()`` or ``look_at()``. "
"However, these methods cannot be called every frame or the physics engine "
"will not be able to correctly simulate the body's state. As an example, "
"consider a rigid body that you want to rotate so that it points towards "
"another object. A common mistake when implementing this kind of behavior is "
"to use ``look_at()`` every frame, which breaks the physics simulation. "
"Below, we'll demonstrate how to implement this correctly."
msgstr ""
"如果你只需要放置一次刚体, 例如设置它的初始位置, 你可以使用 :ref:`Spatial "
"<class_Spatial>` 节点提供的方法, 例如 ``set_global_transform()`` 或 "
"``look_at()`` . 但是, 这些方法不能每一帧都被调用, 否则物理引擎将无法正确地模"
"拟物体的状态. 举个例子, 考虑一个刚体, 你想旋转它, 使它指向另一个对象. 在实现"
"这种行为时, 一个常见的错误是每一帧都使用 ``look_at()`` , 这样会破坏物理模拟. "
"下面, 我们将演示如何正确地实现这一点."

msgid ""
"The fact that you can't use ``set_global_transform()`` or ``look_at()`` "
"methods doesn't mean that you can't have full control of a rigid body. "
"Instead, you can control it by using the ``_integrate_forces()`` callback. "
"In this method, you can add *forces*, apply *impulses*, or set the "
"*velocity* in order to achieve any movement you desire."
msgstr ""
"你不能使用 ``set_global_transform()`` 或 ``look_at()`` 方法并不意味着你不能完"
"全控制一个刚体. 相反, 你可以通过使用 ``_integrate_forces()`` 回调来控制它. 在"
"这个方法中, 你可以添加 *力* , 应用 *冲量* , 或者设置 *速度* , 以实现你想要的"
"任何运动."

msgid "The \"look at\" method"
msgstr "“look at”方法"

msgid ""
"As described above, using the Spatial node's ``look_at()`` method can't be "
"used each frame to follow a target. Here is a custom ``look_at()`` method "
"that will work reliably with rigid bodies:"
msgstr ""
"如上所述, 使用Spatial节点的 ``look_at()`` 方法不能每一帧都用来跟踪一个目标. "
"这里有一个自定义的 ``look_at()`` 方法, 它可以可靠地工作在刚体上:"

msgid ""
"This method uses the rigid body's ``set_angular_velocity()`` method to "
"rotate the body. It first calculates the difference between the current and "
"desired angle and then adds the velocity needed to rotate by that amount in "
"one frame's time."
msgstr ""
"使用刚体的 ``set_angular_velocity()`` 方法来旋转刚体. 它首先计算当前角度和期"
"望角度之间的差值, 然后加上一帧时间内旋转所需的速度."

msgid ""
"This script will not work with rigid bodies in *character mode* because "
"then, the body's rotation is locked. In that case, you would have to rotate "
"the attached mesh node instead using the standard Spatial methods."
msgstr ""
"这个脚本不能用于 *character模式* 下的刚体, 因为这样的话, 刚体的旋转就会被锁"
"定. 在这种情况下, 你必须使用标准的 Spatial 方法来旋转附加的网格节点."
