msgstr "使用 Area2D"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

"Godot offers a number of collision objects to provide both collision "
"detection and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your project "
"can be confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if you "
"understand how each of them works and what their pros and cons are. In this "
"tutorial, we'll look at the :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` node and show some "
"examples of how it can be used."
msgstr ""
"Godot提供了许多碰撞对象来提供碰撞检测和响应. 试图决定为你的项目使用哪一个可能"
"会让人感到困惑. 如果你了解它们各自的工作原理以及它们的优点和缺点, 你就可以避"
"免问题并简化开发. 在本教程中, 我们将查看 :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` 节点, "
"并展示一些如何使用它的例子."

"This document assumes you're familiar with Godot's various physics bodies. "
"Please read :ref:`doc_physics_introduction` first."
msgstr ""
"本文假设你熟悉 Godot 中的各种物理体，否则请先阅读 :ref:"
"`doc_physics_introduction` 。"

msgid "What is an area?"
msgstr "什么是区域？"

msgid ""
"An Area2D defines a region of 2D space. In this space you can detect other :"
"ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` nodes overlapping, "
"entering, and exiting. Areas also allow for overriding local physics "
"properties. We'll explore each of these functions below."
msgstr ""
"Area2D定义了二维空间的区域. 在这个空间中, 你可以检测到其他 :ref:"
"`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` 节点的重叠, 进入和退出. 区域"
"(Area)还允许覆盖本地物理属性. 我们将在下面讨论这些功能中的每一个."

msgid "Area properties"
msgstr "Area 的属性"

msgid "Areas have many properties you can use to customize their behavior."
msgstr "区域有许多属性可用于自定义它们的行为."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The ``Gravity``, ``Linear Damp``, and ``Angular Damp`` sections are used to "
"configure the area's physics override behavior. We'll look at how to use "
"those in the *Area influence* section below."
msgstr ""
"前八个属性用于配置区域的物理覆盖行为. 我们将在下面一节中介绍如何使用这些内容."

msgid ""
"``Monitoring`` and ``Monitorable`` are used to enable and disable the area."
msgstr "``Monitoring`` 和 ``Monitorable`` 用于启用和禁用该区域。"

msgid ""
"The ``Audio Bus`` section allows you to override audio in the area, for "
"example to apply an audio effect when the player moves through."
msgstr ""
"\"音频总线 (Audio Bus)\" 部分, 允许重写该区域内的音频, 例如当玩家移动时的音频"
"效果."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Note that Area2D extends :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, "
"so it also provides properties inherited from that class. The ``Collision`` "
"section of ``CollisionObject2D`` is where you configure the area's collision "
"layer(s) and mask(s)."
msgstr ""
"请注意,Area2D扩展了 :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, 所以"
"它也提供了从该类继承的属性, 例如 ``input_pickable`` ."

msgid "Overlap detection"
msgstr "重叠检测"

msgid ""
"Perhaps the most common use of Area2D nodes is for contact and overlap "
"detection. When you need to know that two objects have touched, but don't "
"need physical collision, you can use an area to notify you of the contact."
msgstr ""
"也许Area2D节点最常见的用途是用于触碰和重叠检测. 当需要知道两个物体已经触碰, "
"但不需要物理碰撞时, 可以使用一个区域来通知."

msgid ""
"For example, let's say we're making a coin for the player to pick up. The "
"coin is not a solid object - the player can't stand on it or push it - we "
"just want it to disappear when the player touches it."
msgstr ""
"例如, 要做一个硬币让玩家去捡. 硬币并不是一个实心的物体, 玩家不能站在上面, 也"
"不能推它, 只是想让它在玩家触碰它的时候消失."

msgid "Here's the node setup for the coin:"
msgstr "这是硬币节点的设置:"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"To detect the overlap, we'll connect the appropriate signal on the Area2D. "
"Which signal to use depends on the player's node type. If the player is "
"another area, use ``area_entered``. However, let's assume our player is a "
"``CharacterBody2D`` (and therefore a ``CollisionObject2D`` type), so we'll "
"connect the ``body_entered`` signal."
msgstr ""
"为了检测重叠, 我们将在Area2d上连接相应的信号, 使用哪个信号取决于玩家的节点类"
"型. 如果玩家是另一个区域(Area2d), 就使用 ``area_entered`` . 然而假设玩家是一"
"个 ``KinematicBody2D`` (因此也是一个 ``CollisionObject2D`` 类型), 将连接 "
"``body_entered`` 信号."

msgid ""
"If you're not familiar with using signals, see :ref:`doc_signals` for an "
"introduction."
msgstr "如果熟悉使用信号, 请参阅 :ref:`doc_signals` 的介绍."

msgid "Now our player can collect the coins!"
msgstr "现在我们的游戏角色可以收集硬币了！"

msgid "Some other usage examples:"
msgstr "其他一些使用实例："

msgid ""
"Areas are great for bullets and other projectiles that hit and deal damage, "
"but don't need any other physics such as bouncing."
msgstr ""
"区域对于子弹和其他弹丸物体来说是非常好用, 它可以击中并造成伤害, 但不需要其他"
"物理效果, 如弹跳."

msgid ""
"Use a large circular area around an enemy to define its \"detect\" radius. "
"When the player is outside the area, the enemy can't \"see\" it."
msgstr ""
"用敌人周围的一个大圆圈区域设定为 \"探测\" 半径, 当玩家在该区域外时, 敌人就无"
"法 \"看到\" 玩家."

msgid ""
"\"Security cameras\" - In a large level with multiple cameras, attach areas "
"to each camera and activate them when the player enters."
msgstr ""
"\"安保摄像头\" - 在有多个摄像头的大型关卡中, 在每个摄像头上附加区域(area), 并"
"在玩家进入时激活它们."

msgid ""
"See the :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game` for an example of using Area2D in a "
"game."
msgstr "游戏中使用 Area2D 的示例请参阅 :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game`\\ 。"

msgid "Area influence"
msgstr "区域影响"

msgid ""
"The second major use for area nodes is to alter physics. By default, the "
"area won't do this, but you can enable this with the ``Space Override`` "
"property. When areas overlap, they are processed in ``Priority`` order "
"(higher priority areas are processed first). There are four options for "
"override:"
msgstr ""
"区域节点的第二个主要用途是改变物理效果。默认情况下，区域不会这样做，但你可以"
"用 *空间覆盖（Space Override）* 属性启用这个功能。当区域重叠时，它们会按照 *"
"优先级（Priority）* 的顺序进行处理（优先级较高的区域会被优先处理）。覆盖有四"
"个选项:"

msgid ""
"*Combine* - The area adds its values to what has been calculated so far."
msgstr "*合并(Combine)* - 该区域将其数值加到目前已计算的数值上."

msgid ""
"*Replace* - The area replaces physics properties, and lower priority areas "
"are ignored."
msgstr "*替换(Replace)* - 该区域替换物理属性, 低优先级区域被忽略."

msgid ""
"*Combine-Replace* - The area adds its gravity/damping values to whatever has "
"been calculated so far (in priority order), ignoring any lower priority "
"areas."
msgstr ""
"*合并-替换 (Combine-Replace)* - 该区域将其重力/阻尼值加到目前为止计算出的所有"
"数值上(按优先顺序), 忽略任何较低优先级的区域."

msgid ""
"*Replace-Combine* - The area replaces any gravity/damping calculated so far, "
"but keeps calculating the rest of the areas."
msgstr ""
"*替换-合并 (Replace-Combine)* - 该区域替换了目前为止计算的所有重力或阻尼, 但"
"继续计算其余区域."

msgid ""
"Using these properties, you can create very complex behavior with multiple "
"overlapping areas."
msgstr "使用这些属性, 可以创建具有多个重叠区域的复杂行为."

msgid "The physics properties that can be overridden are:"
msgstr "可以重写的物理属性有:"

msgid "*Gravity* - Gravity's strength inside the area."
msgstr "*重力(Gravity)* - 区域内的重力强度."

msgid "*Gravity Direction* - This vector does not need to be normalized."
msgstr "*重力方向 (Gravity Direction)* - 此向量不需要归一化。"

msgid ""
"The ``Gravity Point`` property allows you to create an \"attractor\". "
"Gravity in the area will be calculated towards a point, given by the ``Point "
"Center`` property. Values are relative to the Area2D, so for example using "
"``(0, 0)`` will attract objects to the center of the area."
msgstr ""
"*重力点 (Gravity Point)* 属性允许您创建一个 \"吸引器\" . 区域中的重力将按 *重"
"力向量 (Gravity Vec)* 属性给出的点进行计算. 值是相对于Area2D而言的, 因此例如"
"使用 ``(0, 0)`` 将吸引对象到区域中心."
