msgid "Using Area2D"
msgstr "使用 Area2D"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"Godot offers a number of collision objects to provide both collision "
"detection and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your project "
"can be confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if you "
"understand how each of them works and what their pros and cons are. In this "
"tutorial, we'll look at the :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` node and show some "
"examples of how it can be used."
msgstr ""
"Godot提供了许多碰撞对象来提供碰撞检测和响应. 试图决定为你的项目使用哪一个可能"
"会让人感到困惑. 如果你了解它们各自的工作原理以及它们的优点和缺点, 你就可以避"
"免问题并简化开发. 在本教程中, 我们将查看 :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` 节点, "
"并展示一些如何使用它的例子."

msgid ""
"This document assumes you're familiar with Godot's various physics bodies. "
"Please read :ref:`doc_physics_introduction` first."
msgstr ""
"本文假设您熟悉Godot中的各种物理体. 否则请先阅读 :ref:"
"`doc_physics_introduction` ."

msgid "What is an area?"
msgstr "什么是区域？"

msgid ""
"An Area2D defines a region of 2D space. In this space you can detect other :"
"ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` nodes overlapping, "
"entering, and exiting. Areas also allow for overriding local physics "
"properties. We'll explore each of these functions below."
msgstr ""
"Area2D定义了二维空间的区域. 在这个空间中, 您可以检测到其他 :ref:"
"`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` 节点的重叠, 进入和退出. 区域"
"(Area)还允许覆盖本地物理属性. 我们将在下面讨论这些功能中的每一个."

msgid "Area properties"
msgstr "Area 的属性"

msgid "Areas have many properties you can use to customize their behavior."
msgstr "区域有许多属性可用于自定义它们的行为."

msgid ""
"The first eight properties are used to configure the area's physics override "
"behavior. We'll look at how to use those in the section below."
msgstr ""
"前八个属性用于配置区域的物理覆盖行为. 我们将在下面一节中介绍如何使用这些内容."

msgid "*Monitoring* and *Monitorable* are used to enable and disable the area."
msgstr "*Monitoring* 和 *Monitorable* 用于启用和禁用该区域检测."

msgid ""
"The \"Collision\" section is where you configure the area's collision "
"layer(s) and mask(s)."
msgstr "在 \"碰撞(Collision)\" 部分, 可以配置区域的碰撞层和掩码."

msgid ""
"The \"Audio Bus\" section allows you to override audio in the area, for "
"example to apply an audio effect when the player moves through."
msgstr ""
"\"音频总线 (Audio Bus)\" 部分, 允许重写该区域内的音频, 例如当玩家移动时的音频"
"效果."

msgid ""
"Note that Area2D extends :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, "
"so it also provides properties inherited from that class, such as "
"``input_pickable``."
msgstr ""
"请注意,Area2D扩展了 :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, 所以"
"它也提供了从该类继承的属性, 例如 ``input_pickable`` ."

msgid "Overlap detection"
msgstr "重叠检测"

msgid ""
"Perhaps the most common use of Area2D nodes is for contact and overlap "
"detection. When you need to know that two objects have touched, but don't "
"need physical collision, you can use an area to notify you of the contact."
msgstr ""
"也许Area2D节点最常见的用途是用于触碰和重叠检测. 当需要知道两个物体已经触碰, "
"但不需要物理碰撞时, 可以使用一个区域来通知."

msgid ""
"For example, let's say we're making a coin for the player to pick up. The "
"coin is not a solid object - the player can't stand on it or push it - we "
"just want it to disappear when the player touches it."
msgstr ""
"例如, 要做一个硬币让玩家去捡. 硬币并不是一个实心的物体, 玩家不能站在上面, 也"
"不能推它, 只是想让它在玩家触碰它的时候消失."

msgid "Here's the node setup for the coin:"
msgstr "这是硬币节点的设置:"

msgid ""
"To detect the overlap, we'll connect the appropriate signal on the Area2d. "
"Which signal to use depends on the player's node type. If the player is "
"another area, use ``area_entered``. However, let's assume our player is a "
"``KinematicBody2D`` (and therefore a ``CollisionObject2D`` type), so we'll "
"connect the ``body_entered`` signal."
msgstr ""
"为了检测重叠, 我们将在Area2d上连接相应的信号, 使用哪个信号取决于玩家的节点类"
"型. 如果玩家是另一个区域(Area2d), 就使用 ``area_entered`` . 然而假设玩家是一"
"个 ``KinematicBody2D`` (因此也是一个 ``CollisionObject2D`` 类型), 将连接 "
"``body_entered`` 信号."

msgid ""
"If you're not familiar with using signals, see :ref:`doc_signals` for an "
"introduction."
msgstr "如果熟悉使用信号, 请参阅 :ref:`doc_signals` 的介绍."

msgid "Now our player can collect the coins!"
msgstr "现在我们的游戏角色可以收集硬币了！"

msgid "Some other usage examples:"
msgstr "其他一些使用实例："

msgid ""
"Areas are great for bullets and other projectiles that hit and deal damage, "
"but don't need any other physics such as bouncing."
msgstr ""
"区域对于子弹和其他弹丸物体来说是非常好用, 它可以击中并造成伤害, 但不需要其他"
"物理效果, 如弹跳."

msgid ""
"Use a large circular area around an enemy to define its \"detect\" radius. "
"When the player is outside the area, the enemy can't \"see\" it."
msgstr ""
"用敌人周围的一个大圆圈区域设定为 \"探测\" 半径, 当玩家在该区域外时, 敌人就无"
"法 \"看到\" 玩家."

msgid ""
"\"Security cameras\" - In a large level with multiple cameras, attach areas "
"to each camera and activate them when the player enters."
msgstr ""
"\"安保摄像头\" - 在有多个摄像头的大型关卡中, 在每个摄像头上附加区域(area), 并"
"在玩家进入时激活它们."

msgid ""
"See the :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game` for an example of using Area2D in a "
"game."
msgstr "游戏中使用 Area2D 的示例请参阅 :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game`\\ 。"

msgid "Area influence"
msgstr "区域影响"

msgid ""
"The second major use for area nodes is to alter physics. By default, the "
"area won't do this, but you can enable this with the *Space Override* "
"property. When areas overlap, they are processed in *Priority* order (higher "
"priority areas are processed first). There are four options for override:"
msgstr ""
"区域节点的第二个主要用途是改变物理效果. 默认情况下, 区域不会这样做, 但你可以"
"用 *空间重写(Space Override)* 属性启用这个功能. 当区域重叠时, 它们会按照 *优"
"先级(Priority)* 的顺序进行处理(优先级较高的区域会被优先处理). 重写有四个选项:"

msgid ""
"*Combine* - The area adds its values to what has been calculated so far."
msgstr "*合并(Combine)* - 该区域将其数值加到目前已计算的数值上."

msgid ""
"*Replace* - The area replaces physics properties, and lower priority areas "
"are ignored."
msgstr "*替换(Replace)* - 该区域替换物理属性, 低优先级区域被忽略."

msgid ""
"*Combine-Replace* - The area adds its gravity/damping values to whatever has "
"been calculated so far (in priority order), ignoring any lower priority "
"areas."
msgstr ""
"*合并-替换 (Combine-Replace)* - 该区域将其重力/阻尼值加到目前为止计算出的所有"
"数值上(按优先顺序), 忽略任何较低优先级的区域."

msgid ""
"*Replace-Combine* - The area replaces any gravity/damping calculated so far, "
"but keeps calculating the rest of the areas."
msgstr ""
"*替换-合并 (Replace-Combine)* - 该区域替换了目前为止计算的所有重力或阻尼, 但"
"继续计算其余区域."

msgid ""
"Using these properties, you can create very complex behavior with multiple "
"overlapping areas."
msgstr "使用这些属性, 可以创建具有多个重叠区域的复杂行为."

msgid "The physics properties that can be overridden are:"
msgstr "可以重写的物理属性有:"

msgid "*Gravity* - Gravity's strength inside the area."
msgstr "*重力(Gravity)* - 区域内的重力强度."

msgid ""
"*Gravity Vec* - Gravity's direction. This vector does not need to be "
"normalized."
msgstr "*重力向量 (Gravity Vec)* - 重力的方向. 此向量不需要归一化."

msgid ""
"*Linear Damp* - How quickly objects stop moving - linear velocity lost per "
"second."
msgstr "*线性阻尼 (Linear Damp)* - 物体停止移动的速度-每秒损失的线速度."

msgid ""
"*Angular Damp* - How quickly objects stop spinning - angular velocity lost "
"per second."
msgstr "*角度阻尼 (Angular Damp)* - 物体停止旋转的速度-每秒损失的角速度."

msgid "Point gravity"
msgstr "重力点"

msgid ""
"The *Gravity Point* property allows you to create an \"attractor\". Gravity "
"in the area will be calculated towards a point, given by the *Gravity Vec* "
"property. Values are relative to the Area2D, so for example using ``(0, 0)`` "
"will attract objects to the center of the area."
msgstr ""
"*重力点 (Gravity Point)* 属性允许您创建一个 \"吸引器\" . 区域中的重力将按 *重"
"力向量 (Gravity Vec)* 属性给出的点进行计算. 值是相对于Area2D而言的, 因此例如"
"使用 ``(0, 0)`` 将吸引对象到区域中心."

msgid "Examples"
msgstr "示例"

msgid ""
"The example project attached below has three areas demonstrating physics "
"override."
msgstr "以下所附中的示例项目包含三个区域, 它们说明了物理重写."

msgid ""
"You can download this project here: :download:`using_area_2d.zip <files/"
"using_area_2d.zip>`"
