":ref:`Convex collision shapes <class_ConvexPolygonShape3D>` are a compromise "
"between primitive collision shapes and concave collision shapes. They can "
"represent shapes of any complexity, but with an important caveat. As their "
"name implies, an individual shape can only represent a *convex* shape. For "
"instance, a pyramid is *convex*, but a hollow box is *concave*. To define a "
"concave object with a single collision shape, you need to use a concave "
"collision shape."
msgstr ""
":ref:`凸形碰撞形状 <class_ConvexPolygonShape>` 是基础碰撞形状和凹形碰撞形状之"
"间的折衷, 可以表示任何复杂的形状, 但要警告的是, 正如名称所示, 一个单独的形状"
"只能表示一个 *凸* 的形状. 要用单个碰撞形状定义一个凹形对象, 需要使用一个凹形"
"碰撞形状. 例如, 一个金字塔是 *凸* 的, 但一个空心盒子是 *凹* 的."

msgid ""
"Depending on the object's complexity, you may get better performance by "
"using multiple convex shapes instead of a concave collision shape. Godot "
"lets you use *convex decomposition* to generate convex shapes that roughly "
"match a hollow object. Note this performance advantage no longer applies "
"after a certain amount of convex shapes. For large and complex objects such "
"as a whole level, we recommend using concave shapes instead."
msgstr ""
"根据对象的复杂程度, 可能要通过使用多个凸形而不是一个凹形碰撞形状来获得更好的"
"性能.Godot可以使用 *凸分解* 来生成与空心物体大致匹配的凸形. 请注意, 在一定数"
"量的凸形之后, 就没有了这种性能优势, 对于大而复杂的对象, 如整个关卡, 建议使用"
"凹形代替."

"**Create Single Convex Collision Sibling** uses the Quickhull algorithm. It "

"**Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings** uses the V-HACD algorithm. It "

"cost of performance. For objects with medium complexity, it will likely be "
"faster than using a single concave collision shape."

"When not using GridMaps for level design, concave shapes are the best "
"approach for a level's collision. That said, if your level has small "
"details, you may want to exclude those from collision for performance and "
"game feel. To do so, you can build a simplified collision mesh in a 3D "

msgid ""
"You aren't limited to a single collision shape per PhysicsBody. Still, we "
"recommend keeping the number of shapes as low as possible to improve "
"performance, especially for dynamic objects like RigidBodies and "
"CharacterBodies. On top of that, avoid translating, rotating, or scaling "
"CollisionShapes to benefit from the physics engine's internal optimizations."
msgstr ""
"每个 PhysicsBody（物理体）不限于一个碰撞形状。尽管如此，我们还是建议尽量减少"
"碰撞形状的数量以提高性能。特别是对于像 RigidBodies （刚体）和 "
"KinematicBodies （运动体）这样的动态对象。除此之外，避免 translating（平"
"移）， rotating（旋转）或 scaling（缩放）碰撞形状，可以提高物理引擎运行效率。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"When using a single non-transformed collision shape in a StaticBody, the "
"engine's *broad phase* algorithm can discard inactive PhysicsBodies. The "
"*narrow phase* will then only have to take into account the active bodies' "
"shapes. If a StaticBody has many collision shapes, the broad phase will "
"fail. The narrow phase, which is slower, must then perform a collision check "
"against each shape."
msgstr ""
"在 StaticBody 中使用单个非转换碰撞形状（non-transformed collision shape）时，"
"引擎的 *宽相位（broad phase）* 算法可以丢弃不活跃的 PhysicsBody。这个 *窄相位"
"（narrow phase）* 只需考虑到活跃物体的形状。如果一个 StaticBody 有许多碰撞形"
"状， 那么宽相位就会失败。较慢的窄相位必须对每个形状执行碰撞检查。"

msgid ""
"If you run into performance issues, you may have to make tradeoffs in terms "
"of accuracy. Most games out there don't have a 100% accurate collision. They "
"find creative ways to hide it or otherwise make it unnoticeable during "
"normal gameplay."
msgstr ""
