"Often one needs scripts that rely on other objects for features. There are 2 "
"parts to this process:"

msgid "Accessing the data or logic from the object."

"For all :ref:`Object <class_Object>`\\s, the most basic way of referencing "
"them is to get a reference to an existing object from another acquired "
"instance."

"对所有 :ref:`Object <class_Object>` 来说，获得引用的最基础的方法，是从另一个"

"The same principle applies for :ref:`RefCounted <class_RefCounted>` objects. "
"While users often access :ref:`Node <class_Node>` and :ref:`Resource "
"<class_Resource>` this way, alternative measures are available."
msgstr ""
"同样的原则也适用于 :ref:`Reference <class_Reference>` 对象。虽然使用者经常以"
"这种方式访问 :ref:`Node <class_Node>` 和 :ref:`Resource <class_Resource>`，但"
"还有另一种方法。"

"Instead of property or method access, one can get Resources by load access."
msgstr "除了访问属性和方法，也可以通过加载来获得 Resource。"

msgid "Note the following:"
msgstr "请注意以下几点："

msgid "There are many ways in which a language can load such resources."
msgstr "在一种语言中，有许多加载这些资源的方法。"

msgid ""
"When designing how objects will access data, don't forget that one can pass "
"resources around as references as well."
msgstr "在设计对象如何访问数据时，不要忘记，还可以将资源作为引用传递。"

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that loading a resource fetches the cached resource instance "
"maintained by the engine. To get a new object, one must :ref:`duplicate "
"<class_Resource_method_duplicate>` an existing reference or instantiate one "
"from scratch with ``new()``."
msgstr ""
"请记住, 加载资源将获取引擎维护的缓存资源实例. 要获取一个新对象, 必须 :ref:`复"
"制 <class_Resource_method_duplicate>` 一个现有引用, 或者使用 ``new()`` 从头实"
"例化一个引用."

"Godot's scripting API is duck-typed. This means that if a script executes an "
"operation, Godot doesn't validate that it supports the operation by "
"**type**. It instead checks that the object **implements** the individual "
"method."
msgstr ""
"Godot的脚本API是鸭子类型. 这意味着, 如果脚本执行操作, 则Godot不会通过 **类型"
"** 验证其是否支持该操作. 相反, 它检查对象是否 **实现** 了单个方法."

msgid ""
"For example, the :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` class has a "
"``visible`` property. All properties exposed to the scripting API are in "
"fact a setter and getter pair bound to a name. If one tried to access :ref:"
"`CanvasItem.visible <class_CanvasItem_property_visible>`, then Godot would "
"do the following checks, in order:"
msgstr ""
"例如, :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` 类有一个 ``visible`` 的属性. 实际"
"上, 脚本API公开的所有属性, 都是绑定到名称的 ``setter`` 和 ``getter`` 对. 如果"
"有人试图访问 :ref:`CanvasItem.visible <class_CanvasItem_property_visible>`, "
"那么Godot会按照以下顺序进行检查:"

msgid ""
"If the object has a script attached, it will attempt to set the property "
"through the script. This leaves open the opportunity for scripts to override "
"a property defined on a base object by overriding the setter method for the "
"property."
msgstr ""
"如果对象附加了脚本, 它将尝试通过脚本设置属性. 通过覆盖属性的 ``setter`` 方"
"法, 这为脚本提供了覆盖基础对象上定义的属性的机会."

msgid ""
"If the script does not have the property, it performs a HashMap lookup in "
"the ClassDB for the \"visible\" property against the CanvasItem class and "
"all of its inherited types. If found, it will call the bound setter or "
"getter. For more information about HashMaps, see the :ref:`data preferences "
"<doc_data_preferences>` docs."
msgstr ""
"如果脚本没有该属性, 它在 ``ClassDB`` 中对 ``CanvasItem`` 类及其所有继承的类型"
"执行 ``visible`` 属性的哈希表查找. 如果找到, 它将调用绑定的 ``setter`` 或 "
"``getter``. 有关哈希表的更多信息, 参见 :ref:`数据偏好 "
"<doc_data_preferences>` 文档."

msgid ""
"If not found, it does an explicit check to see if the user wants to access "
"the \"script\" or \"meta\" properties."
msgstr ""
"如果没有找到, 它会进行显式检查, 以查看用户是否要访问 ``script`` 或 ``meta`` "
"属性."

msgid ""
"If not, it checks for a ``_set``/``_get`` implementation (depending on type "
"of access) in the CanvasItem and its inherited types. These methods can "
"execute logic that gives the impression that the Object has a property. This "
"is also the case with the ``_get_property_list`` method."
msgstr ""
"如果没有, 它将在 ``CanvasItem`` 及其继承的类型中检查 ``_set``/``_get`` 实现"
"(取决于访问类型). 这些方法可以执行逻辑, 从而给人一种对象具有属性的印象. "
"``_get_property_list`` 方法也是如此."

msgid ""
"Note that this happens even for non-legal symbol names, such as names "
"starting with a digit or containing a slash."

msgid ""
"As a result, this duck-typed system can locate a property either in the "
"script, the object's class, or any class that object inherits, but only for "
"things which extend Object."
msgstr ""
"因此, 这个鸭子类型的系统可以在脚本, 对象的类, 或对象继承的任何类, 但只能用于"
