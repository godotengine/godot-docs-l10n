"This series is a collection of best practices to help you work efficiently "
"with Godot."
msgstr "本系列是最佳实践的合集，可让您在使用 Godot 时更加高效。"

"Godot allows for a great amount of flexibility in how you structure a "
"project's codebase and break it down into scenes. Each approach has its pros "
"and cons, and they can be hard to weigh until you've worked with the engine "
"for long enough."
msgstr ""
"在 Godot 中，你在项目代码结构和拆分场景方面有很大的自由度。不同的做法有不同的"
"优缺点，如果使用引擎的时间不够长，是很难进行权衡的。"

msgid ""
"There are always many ways to structure your code and solve specific "
"programming problems. It would be impossible to cover them all here."
msgstr "构造代码和解决特定编程问题的方法总是有很多的，这里不可能涵盖所有内容。"

msgid ""
"That is why each article starts from a real-world problem. We will break "
"down each problem in fundamental questions, suggest solutions, analyze the "
"pros and cons of each option, and highlight the best course of action for "
"the problem at hand."
msgstr ""
"这就是为什么每篇文章都是从某个现实世界的问题开始的。我们会将每个问题分解为基"
"本问题、提出解决方案、分析每种选择的利弊，并强调针对当前问题的最佳解决方案。"

msgid ""
"You should start by reading :ref:`doc_what_are_godot_classes`. It explains "
"how Godot's nodes and scenes relate to classes and objects in other Object-"
"Oriented programming languages. It will help you make sense of the rest of "
"the series."
msgstr ""
"你应该从 :ref:`doc_what_are_godot_classes` 开始阅读。里面解释了 Godot 的节点"
"和场景与其他面向对象的编程语言中的类和对象的关联，可以帮助你理解本系列的其他"
"内容。"

msgid ""
"The best practices in Godot rely on Object-Oriented design principles. We "
"use tools like the `single responsibility <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Single_responsibility_principle>`_ principle and `encapsulation <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)>`_."
msgstr ""
"Godot 中的最佳实践依赖于面向对象的设计原则。我们使用的是\\ `单一职责 "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle>`_\\ 原则和\\ "
"`封装 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Encapsulation_(computer_programming)>`_\\ 等工具。"
