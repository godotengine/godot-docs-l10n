"Yet there are never enough. Creating your own custom controls that act just "
"the way you want them to is an obsession of almost every GUI programmer. "
"Godot provides plenty of them, but they may not work exactly the way you "
"want. Before contacting the developers with a pull-request to support "
"diagonal scrollbars, at least it will be good to know how to create these "
"controls easily from script."

"不过这是永远不嫌多的。每个 GUI 程序员几乎都痴迷于创建自己的自定义控件，让这些"
"控件让自己的要求工作。Godot 提供了大量的控件，但它们可能并不完全如你所愿的方"
"式工作。在使用支持对角滚动条的拉取请求与开发人员联系之前，至少应该了解如何从"
"脚本轻松地创建这些控件。"

msgid "Checking control size"

msgid ""
"Unlike 2D nodes, \"size\" is important with controls, as it helps to "
"organize them in proper layouts. For this, the :ref:`Control.size "
"<class_Control_property_size>` property is provided. Checking it during "
"``_draw()`` is vital to ensure everything is kept in-bounds."
msgstr ""
"与2D节点不同,\"size\" 对控件很重要, 因为它有助于在适当的布局中组织它们. 为"
"此, 我们提供了 :ref:`Control.rect_size <class_Control_property_rect_size>` 属"
"性. 在 ``_draw()`` 中检查它以确保所有东西都在范围之内."

msgid "Checking focus"
msgstr "检查输入焦点"

msgid ""
"Some controls (such as buttons or text editors) might provide input focus "
"for keyboard or joypad input. Examples of this are entering text or pressing "
"a button. This is controlled with the :ref:`Control.focus_mode "
"<class_Control_property_focus_mode>` property. When drawing, and if the "
"control supports input focus, it is always desired to show some sort of "
"indicator (highlight, box, etc.) to indicate that this is the currently "
"focused control. To check for this status, the :ref:`Control.has_focus() "
"<class_Control_method_has_focus>` method exists. Example"
msgstr ""
"一些控件(如按钮或文本编辑器)可为键盘或手柄输入提供输入焦点. 这方面的例子是输"
"入文本或按下一个按钮. 这可以通过 :ref:`Control.focus_mode "
"<class_Control_property_focus_mode>` 属性来控制. 绘制时, 如果控件支持输入焦"
"点, 总是希望显示某种指示来表明(高亮, 方框等), 当前这是焦点控件. 为了检查这个"
"状态, 存在一个 :ref:`Control.has_focus() <class_Control_method_has_focus>` 的"
"方法. 例子"

msgid "Sizing"
msgstr "调整大小"

msgid ""
"As mentioned before, size is important to controls. This allows them to lay "
"out properly, when set into grids, containers, or anchored. Controls, most "
"of the time, provide a *minimum size* to help properly lay them out. For "
"example, if controls are placed vertically on top of each other using a :ref:"
"`VBoxContainer <class_VBoxContainer>`, the minimum size will make sure your "
"custom control is not squished by the other controls in the container."
msgstr ""
"如前所述, 尺寸对控件是很重要的. 这可以让它们在设置网格, 容器或锚定时以正确布"
"局. 控件, 在大多数情况下, 提供了一个 *minimum size* , 以帮助它们正确布局. 例"
"如, 如果控件被垂直放置在彼此的顶部, 使用 :ref:`VBoxContainer "
"<class_VBoxContainer>` , 最小尺寸将确保你的自定义控件不会被容器中的其他控件挤"
"压."

msgid "Input"
