msgid "Keyboard/Controller Navigation and Focus"
msgstr "键盘/控制器导航和焦点"

msgid ""
"It is a common requirement for a user interface to have full keyboard and "
"controller support for navigation and interaction. There are two main "
"reasons why this is beneficial for projects: improved accessibility (not "
"everyone can use mouse or touch controls for interactions), and getting your "
"project ready for :ref:`consoles <doc_consoles>` (or just for people who "
"prefer to game with a controller on PC)."
msgstr ""
"对于用户界面来说，支持全键盘和控制器进行导航和交互是常见的。这有利于改善项目"
"可访问性，不是每个人都能使用鼠标或触摸控制进行交互，或是让你的项目准备在\\ :"
"ref:`游戏主机 <doc_consoles>`\\ 上运行，或者只是为了那些喜欢在PC上用控制器玩"
"游戏的人。"

msgid ""
"Navigating between UI elements with keyboard or controller is done by "
"changing which node is actively selected. This is also called changing UI "
"focus. Every :ref:`Control <class_Control>` node in Godot is capable of "
"having focus. By default, some control nodes have the ability to "
"automatically grab focus reacting to built-in UI actions such as ``ui_up``, "
"``ui_down``, ``ui_focus_next``, etc. These actions can be seen in the "
"project settings in the input map and can be modified."
msgstr ""
"使用键盘或控制器在 UI 元素之间导航是通过更改主动选择的节点来完成的。这也称为"
"更改 UI 焦点。 Godot 中的每个 :ref:`Control <class_Control>` 节点都能够获得焦"
"点。默认情况下，一些控件节点有能力自动拾取焦点内置的 UI 动作，并做出反应，例"
"如 ``ui_up``, ``ui_down``, ``ui_focus_next`` 等。这些动作可以在项目的输入映射"
"中的设置和修改。"

msgid ""
"Because these actions are used for focus they should not be used for any "
"gameplay code."
msgstr "因为这些动作用于焦点，它们不应该被用于游戏代码。"

msgid "Node settings"
msgstr "节点设置"

msgid ""
"In addition to the built-in logic, you can define what is known as focus "
"neighbors for each individual control node. This allows to finely tune the "
"path the UI focus takes across the user interface of your project. The "
"settings for individual nodes can be found in the Inspector dock, under the "
"\"Focus\" category of the \"Control\" section."
msgstr ""
"除了内置的逻辑之外，你还可以为每个单独的控件节点定义所谓的邻焦点。这允许在你"
"项目的用户界面上的路径微调UI焦点。单个节点的设置可以在检查器栏的 \"Control\" "
"部分的 \"Focus \" 类别下找到。"

msgid ""
"Neighbor options are used to define nodes for 4-directional navigation, such "
"as using arrow keys or a D-pad on a controller. For example, the bottom "
"neighbor will be used when navigating down with the down arrow or by pushing "
"down on the D-pad. The \"Next\" and \"Previous\" options are used with the "
"focus shift button, such as :kbd:`Tab` on desktop operating systems."
msgstr ""
"邻近选项用于定义四向导航的节点，例如使用箭头键或控制器上的方向键。如，当使用"
"向下箭头向下导航或按下方向键时，将使用底部邻近。 “下一个”和“上一个”选项与焦点"
"转移按钮一起使用，例如桌面操作系统上的 :kbd:`Tab`\\ 。"

msgid "A node can lose focus if it becomes hidden."
msgstr "如果节点被隐藏，它就会失去焦点。"

msgid ""
"The mode setting defines how a node can be focused. **All** means a node can "
"be focused by clicking on it with the mouse, or selecting it with a keyboard "
"or controller. **Click** means it can only be focused on by clicking on it. "
"Finally, **None** means it can't be focused at all. Different control nodes "
"have different default settings for this based on how they are typically "
"used, for example, :ref:`Label <class_Label>` nodes are set to \"None\" by "
"default, while :ref:`buttons <class_Button>` are set to \"All\"."
msgstr ""
"模式设置定义了节点如何被聚焦。\\ **All**\\ 意味着节点可以通过用鼠标点击，或用"
"键盘或控制器选择而被关注。\\ **Click**\\ 意味着只能通过点击来关注。最后，\\ "
"**None**\\ 意味着它根本不能被关注。不同的控件节点根据它们的典型使用方式有不同"
"的默认设置，如，\\ :ref:`Label <class_Label>` 节点默认设置为“None”，而\\ :"
"ref:`按钮 <class_Button>`\\ 则为“All”。"

msgid ""
"Make sure to properly configure your scenes for focus and navigation. If a "
"node has no focus neighbor configured, the engine will try to guess the next "
"control automatically. This may result in unintended behavior, especially in "
"a complex user interface that doesn't have well-defined vertical or "
"horizontal navigation flow."
msgstr ""
"确保为焦点和导航正确配置场景。如果节点没有配置邻焦点，引擎将尝试自动猜测下一"
"个控件。这可能会导致意外行为，尤其是在没有明确定义垂直或水平导航操作的复杂用"
"户界面中。"

msgid "Necessary code"
msgstr "必要的代码"

msgid ""
"For keyboard and controller navigation to work correctly, any node must be "
"focused on using code when the scene starts. Without doing this, pressing "
"buttons or keys won't do anything. Here is a basic example of setting "
"initial focus with code:"
msgstr ""
"为了使键盘和控制器导航正常工作，在场景开始时，所有节点都需要使用代码进行焦点"
"控制。如果不这样做，按下按钮或按键时，就不会有任何作用。下面是一个用代码设置"
"初始焦点的基本例子："

msgid ""
"Now when the scene starts the \"Start Button\" node will be focused, and the "
"keyboard or a controller can be used to navigate between it and other UI "
"elements."
msgstr ""
"现在，当场景启动，\"Start Button\" 节点被聚焦，键盘或控制器可以用来在它和其他"
"UI元素之间进行导航。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
