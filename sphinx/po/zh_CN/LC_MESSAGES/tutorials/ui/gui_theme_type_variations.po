"When designing a user interface there may be times when a :ref:`Control "
"<class_Control>` node needs to have a different look than what is normally "
"defined by a :ref:`Theme <class_Theme>`. Every control node has theme "
"property overrides, which allow you to redefine the styling for each "
"individual UI element."
msgstr ""
"设计用户界面时，有时候会想要让某个 :ref:`Control <class_Control>` 节点看起来"
"和 :ref:`Theme <class_Theme>` 中定义的一般样式不同。每个控件节点都有主题属性"
"覆盖项，可以让你针对单独的 UI 元素定义不同的样式。"

msgid ""
"This approach quickly becomes hard to manage, if you need to share the same "
"custom look between several controls. Imagine that you use gray, blue, and "
"red variants of :ref:`Button <class_Button>` throughout your project. "
"Setting it up every time you add a new button element to your interface is a "
"tedious task."
msgstr ""
"如果你需要让若干控件都使用同一个自定义的外观，这样的做法很快就会变得难以管"
"理。想象一下，你的项目里需要用到灰色、蓝色、红色变种的 :ref:`Button "
"<class_Button>`。每在界面里添加一个按钮元素都需要进行设置，非常繁琐。"

"To help with the organization and to better utilize the :ref:`power of "
"themes <doc_gui_skinning>` you can use theme type variations. These work "
"like normal theme types, but instead of being self-sufficient and standalone "
"they extend another, base type."
msgstr ""
"为了方便组织，更好地发挥\\ :ref:`主题的威力 <doc_gui_skinning>`\\ ，你可以使"
"用主题类型变种。它们用起来就像普通的主题类型，但无法自给自足，不是独立的，扩"
"展自其他类型，称作基础类型。"

msgid ""
"Following the previous example, your theme can have some styles, colors, and "
"fonts defined for the ``Button`` type, customizing the looks of every button "
"element in your UI. To then have a gray, red, or blue button you would "
"create a new type, e.g. ``GrayButton``, and mark it as a variation of the "
"base ``Button`` type."
msgstr ""
"还是上面的例子，你的主题可以为 ``Button`` 类型定义样式、颜色、以及字体，UI 中"
"的所有按钮元素都会得到自定义。如果要再有灰色、红色、蓝色按钮，你就会创建一个"
"新的类型，例如 ``GrayButton``\\ ，然后把它标记为基础 ``Button`` 类型的变种。"

msgid ""
"Type variations can replace some aspects of the base type, but keep others. "
"They can also define properties that the base style hasn't defined. For "
"example, your ``GrayButton`` can override the ``normal`` style from the base "
"``Button`` and add ``font_color`` that ``Button`` has never defined. The "
"control will use a combination of both types giving priority to the type "
"variation."
msgstr ""
"类型变种可以在替换掉基础类型的某些内容的同时保留其他方面。它们还可以定义基础"
"样式没有定义的属性。例如，你的 ``GrayButton`` 可以覆盖基础 ``Button`` 的 "
"``normal`` 样式，加上 ``Button`` 里没有定义的 ``font_color``\\ 。控件会使用这"
"两个类型的组合，并且优先使用类型变种。"

msgid ""
"The way controls resolve what theme items they use from each type and each "
"theme is better described in the :ref:`Customizing a project "
"<doc_gui_theme_in_project>` section of the \"Introduction to GUI skinning\" "
"article."
msgstr ""
"控件如何确定使用哪个类型、哪个主题、哪个主题项目，在《GUI 皮肤简介》一文的"
"\\ :ref:`自定义项目 <doc_gui_theme_in_project>`\\ 部分有更详尽的描述。"

"To create a type variation open the theme editor, then click the plus icon "

"要创建主题变种，请打开主题编辑器，然后点击编辑器右侧\\ **类型**\\ 下拉框旁的"

msgid ""
"Click on the plus icon next to the **Base Type** field. You can select the "
"base type there, which would typically be the name of a control node class "
"(e.g., ``Button``, ``Label``, etc). Type variations can also chain and "
"extend other type variations. This works in the same way control nodes "
"inherit styling of their base class. For example, ``CheckButton`` inherits "
"styles from ``Button`` because corresponding node types extend each other."

"点击\\ **基础类型**\\ 字段旁的加号。你可以在此处选择基础类型，一般就是控件节"
"点的类名（例如 ``Button``\\ 、\\ ``Label`` 等）。类型变种还可以进行嵌套，扩展"
"其他类型变种。这就和控件节点的继承基类风格一样。例如，\\ ``CheckButton`` 继"
"承 ``Button`` 的风格，因为对应的节点类型存在扩展关系。"

msgid ""
"After you select the base type, you should now be able to see its properties "
"on the other tabs in the theme editor. You can edit them as usual."
msgstr ""
"选好基础类型之后，你应该就能在主题编辑器的其他选项卡中看到对应的属性了。你可"

"Now that a type variation has been created you can apply it to your nodes. "

"can find the **Theme Type Variation** property. It is empty by default, "
"which means that only the base type has an effect on this node."

"You can either select a type variation from a dropdown list, or input its "
"name manually. Variations appear on the list only if the type variation "
"belongs to the project-wide theme, which you can configure in the project "
"settings. For any other case you have to input the name of the variation "
"manually. Click on the pencil icon to the right. Then type in the name of "
"the type variation and click the check mark icon or press enter. If a type "
"variation with that name exists it will now be used by the node."
