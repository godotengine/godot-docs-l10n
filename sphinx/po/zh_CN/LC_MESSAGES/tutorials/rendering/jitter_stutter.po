msgid "What are jitter and stutter?"
msgstr "什么是抖动和卡顿？"

msgid ""
"*Jitter* and *stutter* are two different alterations to visible motion of "
"objects on screen that may affect a game, even when running at full speed. "
"These effects are mostly visible in games where the world moves at a "
"constant speed in a fixed direction, like runners or platformers."
msgstr ""
"*抖动*\\ （Jitter）和\\ *卡顿*\\ （stutter）是即使游戏在全速运行时，也可能出"
"现在屏幕上物体可见运动中的两种不同变化，可能会影响游戏体验。这些问题在世界以"
"恒定速度朝着固定方向运动的游戏中影响最明显, 比如跑酷或平台类游戏."

msgid "Distinguishing between them"
msgstr "它们之间的区别"

msgid ""
"A game running at a normal framerate without exhibiting any effect will "
"appear smooth:"
msgstr "一款在正常帧下运行, 而不显示任何效果的游戏将显得平滑:"

msgid "A game exhibiting *jitter* will shake constantly in a very subtle way:"
msgstr "游戏展示了\\ *抖动*\\ 将以非常细微的方式持续抖动："

msgid ""
"Finally, a game exhibiting *stutter* will appear smooth, but appear to "
"*stop* or *roll back a frame* every few seconds:"
msgstr ""
"最后，存在“卡顿”的游戏看上去是流畅的，但似乎每隔几秒钟就会\\ *停顿*\\ 或\\ *"
"回滚一帧*\\ ："

msgid "Jitter"
msgstr "抖动"

msgid ""
"There can be many causes of jitter, the most typical one happens when the "
"game *physics frequency* (usually 60 Hz) runs at a different resolution than "
"the monitor refresh rate. Check whether your monitor refresh rate is "
"different from 60 Hz."
msgstr ""
"产生抖动的原因有很多，最典型的情况发生在运行游戏时的\\ *物理频率*\\ （通常为 "
"60 Hz）以与显示器刷新率不同。检查您的显示器刷新率是否为 60 Hz。"

msgid ""
"This is generally not a problem, given that most monitors are 60 Hz, and "
"starting with Godot 3.1, a frame timer was introduced that tries to "
"synchronize with refresh as well as possible."
msgstr ""
"这通常不是一个问题, 因为大多数显示器都是60赫兹, 而且从Godot 3.1开始, 引入了一"
"个帧定时器, 尽量与刷新同步."

msgid ""
"Sometimes only some objects appear to jitter (character or background). This "
"happens when they are processed in different time sources (one is processed "
"in the physics step while another is processed in the idle step). Godot 3.1 "
"does some improvements to this, from allowing kinematic bodies to be "
"animated in the regular _process loop, to further fixes in the frame timer."
msgstr ""
"有时只有一些对象会出现抖动（角色或背景）。当它们在不同的时间源中处理时，就会"
"发生这种情况（一个在物理步骤中处理，另一个在空闲步骤中处理）。Godot 3.1 版本"
"对此做了一些改进，从允许运动体在规则的 _process 循环中被动画化，进一步修正帧"
"定时器。"

msgid ""
"You can use physics interpolation to mitigate physics-related jittering. See "
"`lawnjelly's smoothing-addon <https://github.com/lawnjelly/smoothing-"
"addon>`__ for an add-on that can be dropped into any project to enable "
"physics interpolation."
msgstr ""
"你可以使用物理插值来减少物理相关的抖动。请参阅 `lawnjelly 的平滑插件 "
"<https://github.com/lawnjelly/smoothing-addon>`__\\ ，获得一个可以放入任何项"
"目中以启用物理插值的附加组件。"

msgid "Stutter"
msgstr "卡顿"

msgid ""
"Stutter may happen due to two different reasons. The first, and most obvious "
"one, is the game not being able to keep full framerate performance. Solving "
"this is game specific and will require optimization."
msgstr ""
"产生卡顿有两个不同原因。第一个，也是最明显的一个，就是游戏无法保持完整的帧率"
"性能。解决方法是因游戏而异的，需要进行优化。"

msgid ""
"The second is more complicated, because it is often not associated to the "
"engine or game but the underlying operating system. Here is some information "
"regarding stutter on different OSs."
msgstr ""
"第二个原因更复杂，因为它通常与引擎或游戏无关，而与底层操作系统有关。下面是不"
"同操作系统上，关于卡顿的一些信息。"

msgid "Windows"
msgstr "Windows"

msgid ""
"Windows is known to cause stutter in windowed games. This mostly depends on "
"the hardware installed, drivers version and processes running in parallel (e."
"g. having many browser tabs open may cause stutter in a running game). To "
"avoid this, starting with 3.1, Godot raises the game priority to \"Above "
"Normal\". This helps considerably but may not completely eliminate stutter."
msgstr ""
"众所周知，Windows 操作系统在窗口化游戏时会产生卡顿。这主要取决于您所安装的硬"
"件，驱动程序版本和并行运行的进程（例如，打开多个浏览器标签页可能导致游戏在运"
"行时出现卡顿）。为了避免这种情况，从 3.1 版本开始，Godot 将游戏的优先级提升到"
"了“高于标准”。这样能够相当程度缓解问题，但可能无法完全消除卡顿现象。"

msgid ""
"Eliminating this completely requires giving your game full privileges to "
"become \"time critical\", which is not advised. Some games may do it, but it "
"is advised to learn to live with this problem, as it is common for Windows "
"games and most users won't play games windowed (games that are played in a "
"window, e.g. puzzle games, will usually not exhibit this problem anyway)."
msgstr ""
"完全消除这种情况需要给你的游戏以充分的权限, 使之成为 \"time critical\" , 这是"
"不建议的. 有些游戏可能会这样做, 但建议学会忍受这个问题, 因为这对Windows游戏来"
"说很常见, 而且大多数用户不会在窗口中玩游戏(反正在窗口中玩的游戏, 如益智游戏, "
"通常不会出现这个问题)."

msgid ""
"For fullscreen, Windows gives special priority to the game so stutter is no "
"longer visible and very rare. This is how most games are played."
msgstr ""
"对于全屏来说，Windows 系统对游戏给予了特殊的优先级，所以卡顿现象不再可见，也"
"非常罕见。大多数游戏都是这样玩的。"

msgid "Linux (X11)"
msgstr "Linux（X11）"

msgid ""
"Stutter may be visible on Desktop Linux, but this is usually associated with "
"different video drivers and compositors. Nouveau drivers often exhibit this, "
"while AMD or NVidia proprietary don't. Some compositors may also trigger "
"this problem (e.g. KWin), so it is advised to try using a different one to "
"rule it out as the cause."
msgstr ""
"在 Linux 桌面系统上可以看到卡顿现象，这通常与不同的视频驱动程序和合成程序相"
"关。Nouveau 驱动程序经常表现出这一点，而使用 AMD 和英伟达的驱动程序却不会出"
"现。一些合成器程序也可能引发这个问题（例如 KWin），因此我们建议用另一种方法来"
"排除其原因。"

msgid ""
"There is no workaround for driver or compositor stuttering other than "
"reporting it as an issue to the driver or compositor developers."
msgstr ""
"对于驱动程序或组合程序出现的卡顿现象，除了将其作为问题报告给驱动程序或组合程"
"序开发人员外，没有其他解决办法。"

msgid "macOS"
msgstr "macOS"

msgid ""
"Generally, macOS is stutter-free, although recently some bugs were reported "
"when running on fullscreen (this is a macOS bug). If you have a machine "
"exhibiting this behavior, please let us know."
msgstr ""
"通常情况下，macOS 不会出现卡顿现象，尽管最近在全屏运行时报告了一些 bug（这是 "
"macOS 的 bug）。如果你的机器表现出这种行为，请将这问题提交给我们。"

msgid "Android"
msgstr "Android"

msgid ""
"Generally, Android is stutter and jitter-free because the running activity "
"gets all the priority. That said, there may be problematic devices (older "
"Kindle Fire is known to be one). If you see this problem on Android, please "
"let us know."
msgstr ""
"通常情况下，Android 平台不会出现卡顿和抖动现象，因为运行活动拥有所有的优先"

"iOS devices are generally stutter-free, but older devices running newer "
"versions of the operating system may exhibit problems. This is generally "
"unavoidable."
msgstr ""
"iOS设备通常没有卡顿现象，但运行新版操作系统的旧式设备可能会出现问题。这通常是"
"不可避免的。"

msgid "Reporting stutter or jitter problems"
msgstr "报告卡顿或抖动问题"

msgid ""
"If you are reporting a stutter or jitter problem (opening an issue) not "
"caused by any of the above reasons, please specify very clearly all the "
"information possible about device, operating system, driver versions, etc. "
"This may help to better troubleshoot it."
msgstr ""
"如果您报告的卡顿或抖动问题（提交 Issue）不是由上述原因引起的，请尽可能详细说"
"明关于您的设备配置、操作系统、驱动程序版本等信息。这有助于我们更好地排除故"

msgid ""
"Also make sure to use the correct term (jitter or stutter) based on the "
"exhibited behavior. This will help understand your issue much faster. "
"Provide a project that can be used to reproduce the issue, and if possible a "
"screen capture demonstrating the bug."
msgstr ""
"还要确保根据所展示的行为使用正确的术语（抖动或卡顿）。这有助于更快地理解您的"
