msgstr "多分辨率问题"

msgid ""
"Developers often have trouble understanding how to best support multiple "
"resolutions in their games. For desktop and console games, this is more or "
"less straightforward, as most screen aspect ratios are 16:9 and resolutions "
"are standard (720p, 1080p, 1440p, 4K, …)."
msgstr ""
"开发人员经常会遇到麻烦, 不知道如何在他们的游戏中最好地支持多种分辨率. 对于桌"

msgid ""
"For mobile games, at first, it was easy. For many years, the iPhone and iPad "
"used the same resolution. When *Retina* was implemented, they just doubled "
"the pixel density; most developers had to supply assets in default and "
"double resolutions."
msgstr ""
"对于手机游戏来说，起初，这很容易。许多年来，iPhone 和 iPad 使用相同的分辨率。"
"当实行 *Retina* 后，他们只是将像素密度提高了一倍；大多数开发商不得不以默认和"
"双倍的分辨率提供素材。"

msgid ""
"Nowadays, this is no longer the case, as there are plenty of different "
"screen sizes, densities, and aspect ratios. Non-conventional sizes are also "
"becoming increasingly popular, such as ultrawide displays."
msgstr ""
"如今, 情况已不再如此, 因为有很多不同的屏幕尺寸, 密度和长宽比. 非传统的尺寸也"
"越来越受欢迎, 如超宽显示屏."

msgid ""
"For 3D games, there is not much of a need to support multiple resolutions "
"(from the aesthetic point of view). The 3D geometry will just fill the "
"screen based on the field of view, disregarding the aspect ratio. The main "
"reason one may want to support this, in this case, is for *performance* "
"reasons (running in lower resolution to increase frames per second)."
msgstr ""
"对于3D游戏来说, 没有太大的必要支持多种分辨率(从审美角度来看).3D几何图形将根据"
"视场填充屏幕, 而不考虑长宽比. 在这种情况下, 人们可能想要支持的主要原因是为了 "
"*性能* 的原因(以较低的分辨率运行以增加每秒的帧数)."

msgid ""
"For 2D and game UIs, this is a different matter, as art needs to be created "
"using specific pixel sizes in software such as Photoshop, GIMP or Krita."
msgstr ""
"对于2D和游戏UI, 这是一个不同的问题, 因为设计需要在Photoshop, GIMP或Krita等软"

msgid ""
"Since layouts, aspect ratios, resolutions, and pixel densities can change so "
"much, it is no longer possible to design UIs for every specific screen. "
"Another method must be used."
msgstr ""

msgid "One size fits all"
msgstr "万全之策"

msgid ""
"The most common approach is to use a single *base* resolution and then fit "
"it to everything else. This resolution is how most players are expected to "
"play the game (given their hardware). For mobile, Google has useful `stats "
"<https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards>`_ online, and for desktop, "
"Steam `also does <https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/>`_."

msgid ""
"As an example, Steam shows that the most common *primary display resolution* "

msgstr ""
"举个例子,Steam显示最常见的 *主要显示分辨率是* 1920×1080, 所以明智的做法是为这"

msgstr "Godot 还提供了一系列通用的容器."

msgid "Base size"
msgstr "基本大小"

msgid ""
"A base size for the window can be specified in the Project Settings under "
"**Display → Window**."
msgstr "窗口的基本尺寸可以在项目设置中的 **Display → Window** 下指定."

msgid ""
"However, what it does is not completely obvious; the engine will *not* "
"attempt to switch the monitor to this resolution. Rather, think of this "
"setting as the \"design size\", i.e. the size of the area that you work with "
"in the editor. This setting corresponds directly to the size of the blue "
"rectangle in the 2D editor."
msgstr ""
"然而, 它的作用并不完全明显; 引擎将 *不* 尝试将显示器切换到此分辨率. 相反, 将"
"此设置视为 \"设计大小\", 即您在编辑器中使用的区域的大小. 此设置直接对应于2D编"

msgid ""
"There is often a need to support devices with screen and window sizes that "
"are different from this base size. Godot offers many ways to control how the "
"viewport will be resized and stretched to different screen sizes."
msgstr ""
"通常需要支持具有与该基本大小不同的屏幕和窗口大小的设备. Godot提供了许多方法来"
"控制视区的大小调整和拉伸到不同的屏幕大小."

msgid ""
"Godot follows a modern approach to multiple resolutions. The engine will "
"never change the monitor's resolution on its own. While changing the "
"monitor's resolution is the most efficient approach, it's also the least "
"reliable approach as it can leave the monitor stuck on a low resolution if "
"the game crashes. This is especially common on macOS or Linux which don't "
"handle resolution changes as well as Windows."
msgstr ""
"Godot遵循了现代多种分辨率的方法. 引擎永远不会自行改变显示器的分辨率. 虽然改变"
"显示器的分辨率是最有效的方法, 但这也是最不可靠的方法, 因为如果游戏崩溃, 它可"
"能会让显示器卡在一个低分辨率上. 这在macOS或Linux上很常见, 因为它们对分辨率变"
"化的处理不如Windows."

msgid ""
"Changing the monitor's resolution also removes any control from the game "
"developer over filtering and aspect ratio stretching, which can be important "
"to ensure correct display for pixel art games."
msgstr ""
"更改显示器的分辨率还会取消游戏开发者对过滤和纵横比拉伸的控制, 这对于确保像素"
"游戏的正确显示画面非常重要."

msgid ""
"On top of that, changing the monitor's resolution makes alt-tabbing in and "
"out of a game much slower since the monitor has to change resolutions every "
"time this is done."
msgstr ""
"最重要的是, 更改显示器的分辨率会使游戏的Alt-Tab键切换速度变慢, 因为每次切换时"
"显示器都必须更改分辨率."

msgid "Resizing"
msgstr "调整大小"

msgid ""
"There are several types of devices, with several types of screens, which in "
"turn have different pixel density and resolutions. Handling all of them can "
"be a lot of work, so Godot tries to make the developer's life a little "
"easier. The :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` node has several functions to "
"handle resizing, and the root node of the scene tree is always a viewport "
"(scenes loaded are instanced as a child of it, and it can always be accessed "
"by calling ``get_tree().get_root()`` or ``get_node(\"/root\")``)."
msgstr ""
"市面上有着各种各样的设备, 拥有各种类型的屏幕, 依次有着不同的像素密度和分辨"

"`Viewport <class_Viewport>` 节点提供了几个处理大小调整的函数, 而场景树的根节"
"点始终是一个Viewport (场景将作为它的子节点被实例化, 并且始终可以通过调用 "
"``get_tree().get_root()`` 或 ``get_node(\"/root\")`` 来访问它."

msgid ""
"In any case, while changing the root Viewport params is probably the most "
"flexible way to deal with the problem, it can be a lot of work, code and "
"guessing, so Godot provides a simple set of parameters in the project "
"settings to handle multiple resolutions."
msgstr ""
"在任何情况下，虽然更改根 Viewport 的参数可能是解决问题的最灵活方法，但这样做"
