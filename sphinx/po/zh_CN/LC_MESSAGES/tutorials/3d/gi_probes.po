msgid "Using GIProbe"
msgstr "使用 GIProbe"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"This feature is only available when using the GLES3 backend. :ref:"
"`doc_baked_lightmaps` can be used as an alternative when using the GLES2 "
"renderer."
msgstr ""
"此功能仅在使用 GLES3 后端时可用。\\ :ref:`doc_baked_lightmaps` 可用作使用 "
"GLES2 渲染器时的替代方法。"

msgid ""
"Just like with :ref:`doc_reflection_probes`, and as stated in the :ref:"
"`doc_spatial_material`, objects can show reflected or diffuse light. GI "
"Probes are similar to Reflection Probes, but they use a different and more "
"complex technique to produce indirect light and reflections."
msgstr ""
"就像 :ref:`doc_reflection_probes`, 并且如 :ref:`doc_spatial_material` 中所"
"述, 对象可以显示反射光或漫反射光. GI探针类似于反射探针, 但它们使用不同且更复"
"杂的技术来产生间接光和反射."

msgid ""
"The strength of GI Probes is real-time, high quality, indirect light. While "
"the scene needs a quick pre-bake for the static objects that will be used, "
"lights can be added, changed or removed, and this will be updated in real-"
"time. Dynamic objects that move within one of these probes will also receive "
"indirect lighting from the scene automatically."
msgstr ""
"GI探针的强度是实时, 高质量, 间接光. 虽然场景需要对将要使用的静态对象进行快速"
"预烘焙, 但可以添加, 更改或删除灯光, 并且这将实时更新. 在其中一个探针内移动的"
"动态对象也将自动从场景接收间接光照."

msgid ""
"Just like with ``ReflectionProbe``, ``GIProbe`` can be blended (in a bit "
"more limited way), so it is possible to provide full real-time lighting for "
"a stage without having to resort to lightmaps."
msgstr ""
"就像反射探针 ``ReflectionProbe`` 一样，GI 探针 ``GIProbe`` 也可以进行混合（但"
"方式比较有限），可以为舞台提供完整的实时照明，不必依赖于光照贴图。"

msgid "The main downsides of ``GIProbe`` are:"
msgstr "``GIProbe`` 的主要缺点是："

msgid ""
"A small amount of light leaking can occur if the level is not carefully "
"designed. This must be artist-tweaked."
msgstr "如果没有仔细设计水平, 可能会发生少量漏光. 这必须是艺术家调整的."

msgid ""
"Performance requirements are higher than for lightmaps, so it may not run "
"properly in low-end integrated GPUs (may need to reduce resolution)."
msgstr ""
"性能要求高于光照贴图, 因此在低端集成GPU中可能无法正常运行(可能需要降低分辨"
"率)."

msgid ""
"Reflections are voxelized, so they don't look as sharp as with "
"``ReflectionProbe``. However, in exchange they are volumetric, so any room "
"size or shape works for them. Mixing them with Screen Space Reflection also "
"works well."
msgstr ""
"反射是体素化的，所以它们看起来不像 ``ReflectionProbe`` 那样清晰。然而，作为交"
"换，它们经过体积化，所以任何房间的大小或形状都可以适用。将它们与屏幕空间反射"
"混合使用时也很有效。"

msgid ""
"They consume considerably more video memory than Reflection Probes, so they "
"must be used with care in the right subdivision sizes."
msgstr ""
"它们比反射探头消耗的视频内存大得多, 所以在使用时必须注意正确的细分尺寸."

msgid "Setting up"
msgstr "设置"

msgid ""
"Just like a ``ReflectionProbe``, simply set up the ``GIProbe`` by wrapping "
"it around the geometry that will be affected."
msgstr ""
"就像反射探针 ``ReflectionProbe`` 一样，只需将 GI 探针 ``GIProbe`` 包裹在受影"
"响的几何体周围即可。"

msgid ""
"Afterwards, make sure to enable the **Use In Baked Light** property on the "
"geometry instances in the inspector. This is required for ``GIProbe`` to "
"recognize objects, otherwise they will be ignored:"
msgstr ""
"在此之后，请在检查器中确认这些几何体实例都启用了 **Use In Baked Light** 属"
"性。进行这样的操作后，对象才会被 ``GIProbe`` 识别，否则会被忽略："

msgid ""
"Once the geometry is set up, push the Bake button that appears on the 3D "
"editor toolbar to begin the pre-baking process:"
msgstr ""
"设置好几何体后, 按下3D编辑器工具栏上出现的 \"烘焙\" 按钮, 开始预烘焙过程:"

msgid ""
"Meshes should have sufficiently thick walls to avoid light leaks (avoid one-"
"sided walls). For interior levels, enclose your level geometry in a "
"sufficiently large box and bridge the loops to close the mesh."
msgstr ""
"网格应该有足够厚的壁, 以避免漏光(避免单面壁). 对于室内关卡, 将你的关卡几何体"
"围在一个足够大的盒子里, 并桥接环路来封闭网格."

msgid "Adding lights"
msgstr "添加灯光"

msgid ""
"Unless there are materials with emission, ``GIProbe`` does nothing by "
"default. Lights need to be added to the scene to have an effect."
msgstr ""
"除非有发光的材质，否则 ``GIProbe`` 默认什么都不做。灯光需要添加到场景中才有效"
"果。"

msgid ""
"The effect of indirect light can be viewed quickly (it is recommended you "
"turn off all ambient/sky lighting to tweak this, though, as shown below):"
msgstr ""
"可以快速查看间接光的效果(建议您关闭所有环境/天空照明以调整它, 但如下所示):"

msgid ""
"In some situations, though, indirect light may be too weak. Lights have an "
"indirect multiplier to tweak this:"
msgstr "但在某些情况下, 间接光线可能太弱. 灯具有间接乘数来调整:"

msgid ""
"And, as ``GIProbe`` lighting updates in real-time, this effect is immediate:"
msgstr "而且，由于 ``GIProbe`` 灯光是实时更新的，所以效果立竿见影："

msgid "Reflections"
msgstr "反射"

msgid ""
"For very metallic materials with low roughness, it's possible to appreciate "
"voxel reflections. Keep in mind that these have far less detail than "
"Reflection Probes or Screen Space Reflections, but fully reflect "
"volumetrically."
msgstr ""
"对于粗糙度很低的金属材质, 可以观察到体素反射. 请注意, 这些细节远不如反射探针"
"或屏幕空间反射, 但却能充分反映体积."

msgid ""
"``GIProbe``\\ s can be easily mixed with Reflection Probes and Screen Space "
"Reflections, as a full 3-stage fallback-chain. This allows to have precise "
"reflections where needed:"
msgstr ""
"``GIProbe`` 可以很容易地与反射探针和屏幕空间反射混合使用，成为一个完整的三阶"
"段回调链。这样就可以在需要的地方进行精确的反射："

msgid "Interior vs exterior"
msgstr "内部与外部"

msgid ""
"GI Probes normally allow mixing with lighting from the sky. This can be "
"disabled when turning on the *Interior* setting."
msgstr ""
"GI 探针通常允许与来自天空的照明混合。打开 *Interior* 设置时可以禁用此功能。"

msgid ""
"The difference becomes clear in the image below, where light from the sky "
"goes from spreading inside to being ignored."
msgstr "在下面的图像中, 差异变得清晰, 来自天空的光从内部传播到被忽略."

msgid ""
"As complex buildings may mix interiors with exteriors, combining GIProbes "
"for both parts works well."
msgstr ""
"由于复杂的建筑物可能将室内和室外混合在一起, 因此将两个部件的GIProbes结合起来"
"非常有效."

msgid "Tweaking"
msgstr "扭捏"

msgid "GI Probes support a few parameters for tweaking:"
msgstr "GI探针支持一些调整参数:"

msgid ""
"**Subdiv** Subdivision used for the probe. The default (128) is generally "
"good for small- to medium-sized areas. Bigger subdivisions use more memory."
msgstr ""
"**Subdiv** 探针使用的细分. 默认值(128)通常适用于中小型区域, 更大的细分将占用"
"更多内存."

msgid "**Extents** Size of the probe. Can be tweaked from the gizmo."
msgstr "**Extents（范围）**\\ 探针的大小。可以通过小工具调整。"

msgid ""
"**Dynamic Range** Maximum light energy the probe can absorb. Higher values "
"allow brighter light, but with less color detail."
msgstr "**动态范围** 探头可以吸收的最大光能. 值越高, 光线越亮, 但颜色细节越少."

msgid ""
"**Energy** Multiplier for all the probe. Can be used to make the indirect "
"light brighter (although it's better to tweak this from the light itself)."
msgstr "**能量** 所有探头的倍增器. 可用于使间接光更亮(尽管最好从灯本身调整它)."

msgid "**Propagation** How much light propagates through the probe internally."
msgstr "**传播** 内部有多少光通过探头传播."

msgid ""
"**Bias** Value used to avoid self-occlusion when doing voxel cone tracing, "
"should generally be above 1.0 (1==voxel size)."
msgstr ""
"**偏置**\\ 用于避免在进行体素锥体追踪时自我遮挡的值，通常应高于 1.0（1 == 体"
"素大小）。"

msgid ""
"**Normal Bias** Alternative type of bias useful for some scenes. Experiment "
"with this one if regular bias does not work."
msgstr ""
"**法线偏置**\\ 对某些场景有用的替代偏置类型。如果常规偏置不起作用，请尝试使用"
"此方法。"

msgid "**Interior** Allows mixing with lighting from the sky."
msgstr "**内部** 允许与天空的灯光混合."

msgid "**Compress** Currently broken. Do not use."
msgstr "**压缩** 目前已损坏. 请勿使用."

msgid ""
"**Data** Contains the light baked data after baking. If you are saving the "
"data it should be saved as a .res file."
msgstr "**数据** 包含烘焙后的光照数据. 如果您要存储, 应将其保存为.res文件."

msgid "Quality"
msgstr "质量"

msgid ""
"``GIProbe``\\ s are quite demanding. It is possible to use lower quality "
"voxel cone tracing in exchange for more performance."
msgstr ""
"``GIProbe``\\ s 的要求相当高. 可以使用较低质量的体素锥体追踪来换取更高的性能."

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
