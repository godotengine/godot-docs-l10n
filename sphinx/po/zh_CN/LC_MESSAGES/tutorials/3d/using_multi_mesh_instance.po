msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"In a normal scenario, you would use a :ref:`MeshInstance "
"<class_MeshInstance>` node to display a 3D mesh like a human model for the "
"main character, but in some cases, you would like to create multiple "
"instances of the same mesh in a scene. You *could* duplicate the same node "
"multiple times and adjust the transforms manually. This may be a tedious "
"process and the result may look mechanical. Also, this method is not "
"conducive to rapid iterations. :ref:`MultiMeshInstance "
"<class_MultiMeshInstance>` is one of the possible solutions to this problem."
msgstr ""
"在正常情况下, 使用一个 :ref:`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>` 节点来显示一"
"个3D网格, 比如主角的人体模型, 但在某些情况下, 会想在一个场景中创建同一个网格"
"的多个实例. 你 *可以* 多次复制同一个节点, 并手动调整变换. 这可能是一个乏味的"
"过程, 结果可能看起来很机械. :ref:`MultiMeshInstance "
"<class_MultiMeshInstance>` 是解决这个问题的一种可能的方法."

msgid ""
"MultiMeshInstance, as the name suggests, creates multiple copies of a "
"MeshInstance over a surface of a specific mesh. An example would be having a "
"tree mesh populate a landscape mesh with trees of random scales and "
"orientations."
msgstr ""
"MultiMeshInstance, 顾名思义, 在特定网格的表面上创建MeshInstance的多个副本. 一"
"个示例是树形网格用随机比例和方向的树填充景观网格."

msgid "Setting up the nodes"
msgstr "设置节点"

msgid ""
"The basic setup requires three nodes: the MultiMeshInstance node and two "
"MeshInstance nodes."
msgstr "基本设置需要三个节点:MultiMeshInstance节点和两个MeshInstance节点."

msgid ""
"One node is used as the target, the mesh that you want to place multiple "
"meshes on. In the tree example, this would be the landscape."
msgstr "一个节点用作目标, 即要放置多个网格的网格. 在树的示例中, 这将是景观."

msgid ""
"The other node is used as the source, the mesh that you want to have "
"duplicated. In the tree case, this would be the tree itself."
msgstr ""
"另一个节点是作为源节点, 也就是你想复制的网格. 在树的情况下, 这将是树本身."

msgid ""
"In our example, we would use a :ref:`Spatial <class_Spatial>` node as the "
"root node of the scene. Your scene tree would look like this:"
msgstr ""
"在我们的示例中, 将使用 :ref:`Node <class_Node>` 作为场景的根节点. 场景树看起"
"来像这样:"

msgid "For simplicity's sake, this tutorial uses built-in primitives."
msgstr "出于简化目的，本教程使用内置图元。"

msgid ""
"Now you have everything ready. Select the MultiMeshInstance node and look at "
"the toolbar, you should see an extra button called ``MultiMesh`` next to "
"``View``. Click it and select *Populate surface* in the dropdown menu. A new "
"window titled *Populate MultiMesh* will pop up."
msgstr ""
"现在您准备好了一切。选择 MultiMeshInstance 节点并查看工具栏，您应该在\\ ``视"
"图``\\ 旁边看到一个名为 ``MultiMesh`` 的额外按钮。单击它并在下拉菜单中选择\\ "
"*填充表面*\\ 。将弹出一个名为\\ *填充表面*\\ 的新窗口。"

msgid "MultiMesh settings"
msgstr "MultiMesh 设置"

msgid "Below are descriptions of the options."
msgstr "以下是选项说明."

msgid "Target Surface"
msgstr "目标表面"

msgid ""
"The mesh used as the target surface on which to place copies of your source "
"mesh."
msgstr "用来放置源网格副本的目标表面的网格."

msgid "Source Mesh"
msgstr "源网格"

msgid "The mesh you want duplicated on the target surface."
msgstr "要在目标曲面上复制的网格."

msgid "Mesh Up Axis"
msgstr "网格向上轴"

msgid "The axis used as the up axis of the source mesh."
msgstr "轴用作源网格的上轴."

msgid "Random Rotation"
msgstr "随机旋转"

msgid "Randomizing the rotation around the up axis of the source mesh."
msgstr "随机地围绕源网格的向上轴旋转."

msgid "Random Tilt"
msgstr "随机砖块"

msgid "Randomizing the overall rotation of the source mesh."
msgstr "随机化源网格的整体旋转."

msgid "Random Scale"
msgstr "随机缩放"

msgid "Randomizing the scale of the source mesh."
msgstr "随机化源网格的比例."

msgid "Scale"
msgstr "Scale(大小)"

msgid ""
"The scale of the source mesh that will be placed over the target surface."
msgstr "将放置在目标曲面上的源网格的比例."

msgid "Amount"
msgstr "量"

msgid "The amount of mesh instances placed over the target surface."
msgstr "放置在目标曲面上的网格实例数量."

msgid ""
"Select the target surface. In the tree case, this should be the landscape "
"node. The source mesh should be the tree node. Adjust the other parameters "
"according to your preference. Press ``Populate`` and multiple copies of the "
"source mesh will be placed over the target mesh. If you are satisfied with "
"the result, you can delete the mesh instance used as the source mesh."
msgstr ""
"选择目标曲面. 在树情况下, 这应该是横向节点. 源网格应该是树节点. 根据您的喜好"
"调整其他参数. 按 ``Populate`` , 源网格的多个副本将放在目标网格上. 如果对结果"
"满意, 可以删除用作源网格的网格实例."

msgid "The end result should look like this:"
msgstr "最终结果应如下所示:"

msgid ""
"To change the result, repeat the previous steps with different parameters."
msgstr "要更改结果, 请使用不同的参数重复相同的步骤."

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
