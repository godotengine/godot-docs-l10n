"Normally, an artist does all the 3D modelling, then all the texturing, looks "
"at their awesome looking model in the 3D DCC and says \"looks fantastic, "
"ready for integration!\" then goes into the game, lighting is setup and the "
"game runs."
msgstr ""
"通常情况下，艺术家会进行所有 3D 建模，然后进行所有纹理处理，在 3D DCC 中查看"
"他们令人敬畏的模型并说“看起来很棒，可以进行整合！”然后进入游戏，设置灯光并运"
"行游戏。"

"So at what point does all this \"HDR\" business come into play? To "
"understand the answer, we need to look at how displays behave."
msgstr ""
"那么, 所有这些\" HDR\"业务在什么时候发挥作用？要理解答案, 我们需要查看显示器"
"的行为."

"Your display outputs linear light ratios from some maximum to some minimum "
"intensity. Modern game engines perform complex math on linear light values "
"in their respective scenes. So what's the problem?"
msgstr ""
"您的显示器输出线性光比率从某个最大强度到某个最小强度. 现代游戏引擎在各自的场"
"景中对线性光值进行复杂的数学计算. 这将会有什么问题呢？"

msgid ""
"The display has a limited range of intensity, depending on the display type. "
"The game engine renders to an unlimited range of intensity values, however. "
"While \"maximum intensity\" means something to an sRGB display, it has no "
"bearing in the game engine; there is only a potentially infinitely wide "
"range of intensity values generated per frame of rendering."
msgstr ""
"根据显示器类型的不同, 显示的强度范围有限. 然而, 游戏引擎渲染的强度值范围没有"
"限制. 虽然 \"最大强度\" 对sRGB显示器来说有一定的意义, 但在游戏引擎中却没有任"
"何影响；每帧渲染时可能产生无限宽的强度值范围."

msgid ""
"This means that some transformation of the scene light intensity, also known "
"as *scene-referred* light ratios, need to be transformed and mapped to fit "
"within the particular output range of the chosen display. This can be most "
"easily understood if we consider virtually photographing our game engine "
"scene through a virtual camera. Here, our virtual camera would apply a "
"particular camera rendering transform to the scene data, and the output "
"would be ready for display on a particular display type."
msgstr ""
"这意味着场景光强，也称为\\ *场景对应*\\ （scene-referred）的光照比率，需要进"
"行转换和映射以适应所选显示器的特定输出范围。这就类似通过虚拟摄像机拍摄我们的"
"游戏引擎场景，在这里，我们的虚拟摄像机将对场景数据应用特定的摄像机渲染变换，"
"其输出将以特定的显示类型显示。"

msgid ""
"Godot does not support high dynamic range *output* yet. It can only perform "
"lighting in HDR and tonemap the result to a low dynamic range image."
msgstr ""
"Godot目前尚不支持高动态范围 *输出*. 它只能在HDR中执行照明, 并将结果映射为低动"
"态范围的图像."

msgid ""
"For advanced users, it is still possible to get a non-tonemapped image of "
"the viewport with full HDR data, which can then be saved to an OpenEXR file."
msgstr ""
"对于高级用户来说, 仍然可以得到一个非色调映射的视图图像与完整的HDR数据, 然后可"
"以保存到一个OpenEXR文件."

msgid "Computer displays"
msgstr "计算机显示器"

msgid ""
"Almost all displays require a nonlinear encoding for the code values sent to "
"them. The display in turn, using its unique transfer characteristic, "
"\"decodes\" the code value into linear light ratios of output, and projects "
"the ratios out of the uniquely colored lights at each reddish, greenish, and "
"blueish emission site."
msgstr ""
"几乎所有显示器都需要对发送给它们的代码值进行非线性编码. 显示器又利用其独特的"
"传输特性, 将代码值 \"解码\" 为输出的线性光比, 并在每个红色, 绿色和蓝色发射点"
"的独特颜色的光中投射出这些比值."

msgid ""
"For a majority of computer displays, the specifications of the display are "
"outlined in accordance with IEC 61966-2-1, also known as the 1996 sRGB "
"specification. This specification outlines how an sRGB display is to behave, "
"including the color of the lights in the LED pixels as well as the transfer "
"characteristics of the input (OETF) and output (EOTF)."
msgstr ""
"对于大多数计算机显示器来说，显示器的规格是根据 IEC 61966-2-1，即 1996 年的 "
"sRGB 规格，进行概述的。该规范概述了 sRGB 显示器的性能，包括 LED 像素中的灯光"
"颜色以及输入（OETF）和输出（EOTF）的传输特性。"

msgid ""
"Not all displays use the same OETF and EOTF as a computer display. For "
"example, television broadcast displays use the BT.1886 EOTF. However, Godot "
"currently only supports sRGB displays."
msgstr ""
"并非所有显示器都使用与计算机显示器相同的OETF和EOTF. 例如, 电视广播显示器使用"
"BT.1886 EOTF. 然而,Godot目前只支持sRGB显示器."

msgid ""
"The sRGB standard is based around the nonlinear relationship between the "
"current to light output of common desktop computing CRT displays."
msgstr ""
"sRGB标准是围绕着常见的桌面计算CRT显示器的电流与光输出之间的非线性关系而制定"
"的."

msgid ""
"The mathematics of a scene-referred model require that we multiply the scene "
"by different values to adjust the intensities and exposure to different "
"light ranges. The transfer function of the display can't appropriately "
"render the wider dynamic range of the game engine's scene output using the "
"simple transfer function of the display. A more complex approach to encoding "
"is required."
msgstr ""
"场景参考模型的数学要求我们将场景乘以不同的值, 以调整不同光照范围的强度和曝"
"光. 显示器简单的传递函数不能恰当地渲染游戏从引擎场景中输出的更大动态范围. 这"
"需要一种更复杂的编码方法."

msgid "Scene linear & asset pipelines"
msgstr "场景线性和资源管道"

msgid ""
"Working in scene-linear sRGB is not as simple as just pressing a switch. "
"First, imported image assets must be converted to linear light ratios on "
"import. Even when linearized, those assets may not be perfectly well-suited "
"for use as textures, depending on how they were generated."
msgstr ""
"在场景线性sRGB中工作并不像按一下开关那样简单. 首先, 导入的图像资产必须在导入"
"时转换为线性光比例. 即使将其线性化, 这些资产也可能并不完全适合用作纹理, 具体"
"取决于它们的生成方式."

msgid "There are two ways to do this:"
msgstr "有两种方法可以做到这一点:"

msgid "sRGB transfer function to display linear ratios on image import"
msgstr "用于在图像导入时显示线性比率的sRGB传递函数"

msgid ""
"This is the easiest method of using sRGB assets, but it's not the most "
"ideal. One issue with this is loss of quality. Using 8 bits per channel to "
"represent linear light ratios is not sufficient to quantize the values "
"correctly. These textures may also be compressed later, which can exacerbate "
"the problem."
msgstr ""
"这是最简单的使用sRGB资源的方法, 但不是最理想的. 这样做的一个问题是质量的损"
"失. 每通道使用8位来表示线性光比率, 不足以正确量化这些值. 这些纹理以后也可能会"
"被压缩, 可能会加剧这个问题."

msgid "Hardware sRGB transfer function to display linear conversion"
msgstr "硬件sRGB传输函数显示线性转换"

msgid ""
"The GPU will do the conversion after reading the texel using floating-point. "
"This works fine on PC and consoles, but most mobile devices don't support "
"it, or they don't support it on compressed texture formats (iOS for example)."
msgstr ""
"GPU 会在使用浮点读取纹素后进行转换。这在 PC 和游戏主机上很好用，但大多数移动"
"设备不支持，或者它们不支持压缩的纹理格式（例如 iOS）。"

msgid "Scene linear to display-referred nonlinear"
msgstr "场景线性到显示参考的非线性"

msgid ""
"After all the rendering is done, the scene linear render requires "
"transforming to a suitable output such as an sRGB display. To do this, "
"enable sRGB conversion in the current :ref:`Environment <class_Environment>` "
"(more on that below)."
msgstr ""
"完成所有渲染后, 场景线性渲染需要转换为适当的输出, 例如sRGB显示. 为此, 请在当"
"前的: :ref:`Environment <class_Environment>` 中启用 sRGB 转换(更多内容见下"
"文)."

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that the **sRGB -> Display Linear** and **Display Linear -> "
"sRGB** conversions must always be **both** enabled. Failing to enable one of "
"them will result in horrible visuals suitable only for avant-garde "
"experimental indie games."
msgstr ""
"请记住, **sRGB ->显示线性(Display Linear)** 和 **显示线性 -> sRGB** 的转换必"
"须始终 **全部(both)** 启用. 未能启用其中一个将导致仅适用于前卫实验性独立游戏"
"的可怕视觉效果."

msgid "Parameters of HDR"
msgstr "HDR的参数"

msgid ""
"HDR settings can be found in the :ref:`Environment <class_Environment>` "
"resource. Most of the time, these are found inside a :ref:`WorldEnvironment "
"<class_WorldEnvironment>` node or set in a Camera node. For more "
"information, see :ref:`doc_environment_and_post_processing`."
msgstr ""
