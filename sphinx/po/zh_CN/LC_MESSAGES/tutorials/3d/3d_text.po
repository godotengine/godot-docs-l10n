"In a project, there may be times when text needs to be created as part of a "
"3D scene and not just in the HUD. Godot provides two methods to do this. The "
"Label3D node and the text mesh for a MeshInstance node."
msgstr ""
"项目中不仅会要在 HUD 中使用文本，有时也会需要把文本作为 3D 场景的一部分。"
"Godot 为此提供了两种方法。Label3D 节点以及 MeshInstance 节点的文本网格。"

"This page does **not** cover how to display a GUI scene in a 3D environment. "
"For information on how to do that see `this <https://github.com/godotengine/"
"godot-demo-projects/tree/master/viewport/2d_in_3d>`__ demo project."
msgstr ""
"这个页面\\ **不会**\\ 涉及如何在 3D 环境中显示 GUI 场景。相关的信息请参考\\ `"
"这个 <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/"
"viewport/2d_in_3d>`__\\ 演示项目。"

msgid "Label3D"
msgstr "Label3D"

msgid ""
"Label3D behaves like a label node but in a 3D space. Unlike label node this "
"can not inherit properties of a GUI theme. However its look remains "
"customizable and uses the same DynamicFont and BitmapFont subresources "
"control nodes use."
msgstr ""
"Label3D 与标签节点行为类似，只不过是换到了 3D 空间中。与标签节点不同，它是不"
"会继承 GUI 主题属性的。不过，还是可以自定义外观的，使用的也是和控件节点同样"
"的 DynamicFont 和 BitmapFont 子资源。"

msgid ""
"Label3D has minimal interaction with a 3D environment, it can be lit up and "
"shaded by light sources if the shaded flag is enabled, but it will not cast "
"a shadow, even with cast shadow turned on under the nodes GeometryInstance3D "
"settings. This is because the node is a quad mesh (one glyph per quad) with "
"transparent textures and has the same limitations as Sprite3D. See :ref:"
"`this page <doc_3d_rendering_limitations_transparency_sorting>` for more "
"information."
msgstr ""
"Label3D 和 3D 环境的交互很少，着色标志启用时能够接受光照、被光源着色，但即便 "
"GeometryInstance3D 节点打开了阴影投射，它也不会投射阴影。这是因为该节点是一个"
"带透明纹理的四边形网格（每个四边形一个字形），有着和 Sprite3D 一样的限制。详"
"情请参阅\\ :ref:`这个页面 "
"<doc_3d_rendering_limitations_transparency_sorting>`。"

msgid "Text mesh"
msgstr "文本网格"

msgid ""
"Text meshes have similarities to Label3D. They display text in a 3D scene, "
"and will use the same DynamicFont subresource. However text is 3D and has "
"the properties of a mesh. A text mesh cast shadows onto the environment and "
"can have a material applied to it. Here is an example of a texture and how "
"it's applied to the mesh."
msgstr ""
"文本网格与 Label3D 类似。会在 3D 场景中显示文本，也会用到相同的 DynamicFont "
"子资源。不过文本是 3D 的，具有网格的属性。文本网格会向环境投射阴影，并且能够"
"应用材质。这个例子展示的是如何在该网格上应用纹理。"

msgid ""
"There are two limitations to text mesh. It can't use bitmap fonts, or fonts "
"with self intersection."
msgstr "文本网格有两个限制。它无法使用位图字体，也不能使用存在自交的字体。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
