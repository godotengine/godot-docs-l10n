msgid "Background"
msgstr "背景"

msgid ""
"The Background section contains settings on how to fill the background "

msgstr ""
"\"背景(Background) \"部分包含有关如何填充背景的设置(屏幕中未绘制对象的部分). "

msgid "There are many ways to set the background:"
msgstr "设置背景的方法有很多种:"

msgid ""
"**Clear Color** uses the default clear color defined by the project. The "

msgid "**Custom Color** is like Clear Color, but with a custom color value."
msgstr ""
"**自定义颜色(Custom Color)** 与清晰颜色(Clear Color)类似, 但具有自定义颜色值."

msgid ""
"**Sky** lets you define a panorama sky (a 360 degree sphere texture) or a "
"procedural sky (a simple sky featuring a gradient and an optional sun). "
"Objects will reflect it and absorb ambient light from it."
msgstr ""
"**天空(Sky)** 可让您定义全景天空（360 度球体纹理）或程序式天空（具有渐变和可"
"选太阳的简单天空）。物体将反射它并从中吸收环境光。"

"that might be added to the scene."
msgstr ""
"环境(如此处定义)是一种光, 它影响具有相同强度的每个几何体. 它是全局的, 独立于"

msgid ""
"There are two types of ambient light: the *Ambient Color* (which is a "
"constant color multiplied by the material albedo) and then one obtained from "
"the *Sky* (as described before, but a sky needs to be set as background for "
"this to be enabled)."
msgstr ""

msgstr "最后有一个 **能量(Energy)** 设置, 这是一个乘数, 在使用HDR时非常有用."

msgid ""
"In general, ambient light should only be used for simple scenes, large "
"exteriors, or for performance reasons (ambient light is cheap), as it does "
"not provide the best lighting quality. It's better to generate ambient light "
"from ReflectionProbe or GIProbe, which will more faithfully simulate how "
"indirect light propagates. Below is a comparison, in terms of quality, "
"between using a flat ambient color and a GIProbe:"
msgstr ""
"一般来说, 环境光应该只用于简单的场景和大型外景, 或是出于性能考虑(环境光消耗"
"少), 但它不能提供最好的光照质量. 最好是用ReflectionProbe或GIProbe生成环境光, "
"这样可以更忠实地模拟间接光的传播方式. 下面是使用平面环境色和GIProbe在质量上的"

msgid "Fog"
msgstr "雾"

msgid ""

msgid ""
"Both of these fog types can have their curve tweaked, making their "

msgstr "这两种雾类型都可以调整它们的曲线, 使它们的过渡或多或少变得清晰."

msgid "Two properties can be tweaked to make the fog effect more interesting:"
msgstr "可以调整两个属性以使雾效果更有趣:"

msgid ""
"The first is **Sun Amount**, which makes use of the Sun Color property of "
"the fog. When looking towards a directional light (usually a sun), the color "
"of the fog will be changed, simulating the sunlight passing through the fog."
msgstr ""
"第一个是 **Sun Amount**\\ ，它利用雾的太阳颜色属性。当朝向平行光（通常是太"
"阳）时，雾的颜色将会改变，模拟穿过雾的阳光。"

msgid ""
"The second is **Transmit Enabled** which simulates more realistic light "
"transmittance. In practice, it makes light stand out more across the fog."
msgstr ""
"第二个是 **Transmit Enabled**\\ ，可以模拟更逼真的透射率。实践中会使光线在雾"

msgid "Tonemap"
msgstr "色调映射"

msgid "*This feature is only available when using the GLES3 backend.*"
msgstr "*此选项仅在使用 GLES3 后端时适用。*"

msgid ""
"Selects the tonemapping curve that will be applied to the scene, from a list "

"other than Linear are used to make light and dark areas more homogeneous, "
"while also avoiding clipping of bright highlights."
msgstr ""
"选择应用于场景的色调映射曲线，选项为电影和游戏工业中所使用的标准曲线。"

msgid "The tone mapping options are:"
msgstr "色调映射选项有："

msgid "**Mode:** The tone mapping mode to use."
msgstr "**Mode（模式）：**\\ 色调映射所使用的模式。"

msgid ""
"**Linear:** The default tonemapping mode. This is the fastest and simplest "
"tonemapping operator, but it causes bright lighting to look blown out, with "
"noticeable clipping in the output colors."
msgstr ""
"**Linear（线性）：**\\ 默认的色调映射模式。这是最快也是最简单的色调映射运算"
"子，但会导致高亮区域过曝，输出颜色出现可见的裁剪。"

msgid ""
"**Reinhardt:** Performs a variation on rendered pixels' colors by this "
"formula: ``color = color / (1 + color)``. This avoids clipping bright "
"highlights, but the resulting image can look a bit dull."
msgstr ""
"**Reinhardt：**\\ 对渲染后像素的颜色按照这个公式执行变化：\\ ``color = "
"color / (1 + color)``\\ 。可以防止裁剪高亮区域，但最终的图像可能会有些暗淡。"

msgid ""
"**Filmic:** This avoids clipping bright highlights, with a resulting image "
"that usually looks more vivid than Reinhardt."
msgstr "**Filmic：**\\ 防止裁剪高亮区域，最终的图像通常比 Reinhardt 鲜艳。"

msgid ""
"**ACES Fitted:** Academy Color Encoding System tonemapper. ACES Fitted is "
"slightly more expensive than other options, but it handles bright lighting "
"in a more realistic fashion by desaturating it as it becomes brighter. ACES "
"typically has a more contrasted output compared to Reinhardt and Filmic. "
"ACES is the recommended option when aiming for photorealistic visuals."
msgstr ""
"**ACES Fitted：**\\ Academy Color Encoding System（学院色彩编码系统）色调映射"
"器。ACES Fitted 比其他选项更耗性能一些，但对于高亮区域的处理方式更真实，越亮"
"饱和度越低。ACES 输出的图像通常比 Reinhardt 和 Filmic 的对比度更高。想要让画"
"面更具真实感时，推荐选用 ACES。"

msgid ""
"**ACES:** *Deprecated (will be removed in Godot 4.0).* Behaves like ACES, "
"but doesn't desaturate lighting as it becomes brighter (which is less "
"realistic). It's recommended to use ACES Fitted instead of ACES."
msgstr ""
"**ACES：**\\ *已废弃（会在 Godot 4.0 中移除）。*\\ 与 ACES 的行为类似，但不会"
"随着灯光的变亮而降低饱和度（真实度更低）。推荐使用 ACES Fitted，不推荐 ACES。"

msgid ""
"**Exposure:** Tone mapping exposure which simulates amount of light received "
"over time (default: ``1.0``). Higher values result in an overall brighter "
"appearance. If the scene appears too dark as a result of a tonemapping "
"operator or whitepoint change, try increasing this value slightly."
msgstr ""
"**Exposure（曝光）：**\\ 色调映射曝光，模拟长时间获取的光照量（默认：\\ "
"``1.0``\\ ）。值越高，整体更亮。修改色调映射运算子或白点后，如果场景看上去太"
"暗，请尝试将这个值略微调高。"

msgid ""
"**White:** Tone mapping whitepoint, which simulates where in the scale white "
"is located (default: ``1.0``). For photorealistic lighting, recommended "
"values are between ``6.0`` and ``8.0``. Higher values result in less blown "
"out highlights, but make the scene appear slightly darker as a whole."
msgstr ""
"**White（白点）：**\\ 光照映射白点，模拟白色在整个尺度中所处的位置（默认：\\ "
"``1.0``\\ ）。为了让光照更真实，推荐使用 ``6.0`` 到 ``8.0`` 之间的值。值越"
"高，高光区域更少过曝，但会让场景整体看起来更暗。"

msgid "Auto Exposure (HDR)"
msgstr "自动曝光（HDR）"

msgid ""
"Even though, in most cases, lighting and texturing are heavily artist "
"controlled, Godot supports a simple high dynamic range implementation with "
"the auto exposure mechanism. This is generally used for the sake of realism "
"when combining interior areas with low light and outdoors. Auto exposure "
"simulates the camera (or eye) in an effort to adapt between light and dark "
"locations and their different amounts of light."
msgstr ""
"尽管在大多数情况下, 照明和纹理都受到艺术家的严格控制, 但Godot通过自动曝光机制"
"支持简单的高动态范围实现. 当将内部区域与低光和户外相结合时, 这通常用于真实"
"性. 自动曝光模拟相机(或眼睛), 以适应明暗位置和不同光量."

msgid ""
"The simplest way to use auto exposure is to make sure outdoor lights (or "
"other strong lights) have energy beyond 1.0. This is done by tweaking their "
"**Energy** multiplier (on the Light itself). To make it consistent, the "
"**Sky** usually needs to use the energy multiplier too, to match with the "
"directional light. Normally, values between 3.0 and 6.0 are enough to "
"simulate indoor-outdoor conditions."
msgstr ""
"使用自动曝光的最简单方法是确保室外灯光（或其他强光）的能量超过 1.0。这是通过"
"调整它们的 **Energy** 乘数（对灯光本身）来实现的。为了使其保持一致，\\ "
"**Sky** 通常也需要使用能量乘数，以配合平行光。通常情况下，数值在 3.0 到 6.0 "
"之间，就足以模拟室内室外条件。"

msgid ""
"By combining Auto Exposure with *Glow* post processing (more on that below), "
"pixels that go over the tonemap **White** will bleed to the glow buffer, "
"creating the typical bloom effect in photography."
msgstr ""
"通过将自动曝光与 *Glow* 后处理相结合（更多内容如下），超过色调映射 **White** "
"的像素将会逸出至辉光缓冲区，从而在摄影中创造典型的泛光效果。"

msgid ""
"The user-controllable values in the Auto Exposure section come with sensible "
"defaults, but you can still tweak them:"
msgstr "\"自动曝光\" 部分中的用户可控值具有合理的默认值, 但您仍然可以调整它们:"

msgid ""
"**Scale:** Value to scale the lighting. Brighter values produce brighter "
"images, smaller ones produce darker ones."
msgstr ""
"**比例:** 用于缩放照明的值. 较亮的值会产生较亮的图像, 较小的值会产生较暗的图"
"像."

msgid ""
"**Min Luma:** Minimum luminance that auto exposure will aim to adjust for. "
"Luminance is the average of the light in all the pixels of the screen."
msgstr ""
"** Min Luma:** 自动曝光旨在调整的最小亮度. 亮度是屏幕所有像素中光线的平均值."

msgid ""
"**Max Luma:** Maximum luminance that auto exposure will aim to adjust for."
msgstr "** Max Luma:** 自动曝光旨在调整的最大亮度."

msgid ""
"**Speed:** Speed at which luminance corrects itself. The higher the value, "
"the faster correction happens."
msgstr "**速度:** 亮度校正的速度. 值越高, 发生的校正越快."

msgid "Mid- and post-processing effects"
msgstr "中后期处理效果"

msgid ""
"A large amount of widely-used mid- and post-processing effects are supported "
"in the Environment."
msgstr "环境支持大量广泛使用的中间和后期处理效果."

msgid "Screen-Space Reflections (SSR)"
msgstr "屏幕空间反射(SSR)"

msgid ""
"While Godot supports three sources of reflection data (Sky, ReflectionProbe, "
"and GIProbe), they may not provide enough detail for all situations. "
"Scenarios where Screen Space Reflections make the most sense are when "
"objects are in contact with each other (object over floor, over a table, "
"floating on water, etc)."
msgstr ""
"虽然 Godot 支持三种反射数据源（Sky、ReflectionProbe、GIProbe），但它们可能无"
"法为所有情况提供足够的细节。屏幕空间反射最有意义的场景是物体彼此接触（地板上"
"的物体、桌子上的物体、漂浮在水面上等）。"

msgid ""
"The other advantage (even if only enabled to a minimum), is that it works in "
"real-time (while the other types of reflections are pre-computed). This can "
"be used to make characters, cars, etc. reflect on surrounding surfaces when "
"moving around."
msgstr ""
"另一个优点(即使只启用最小), 它是实时工作(而其他类型的反射是预先计算的). 这可"
"以用来使人物, 汽车等在移动时反射到周围的表面上."

msgid ""
"A few user-controlled parameters are available to better tweak the technique:"
msgstr "一些用户控制的参数可用于更好地调整技术:"

msgid ""
"**Max Steps** determines the length of the reflection. The bigger this "
"number, the more costly it is to compute."
msgstr "**最大步数** 确定反射的长度. 这个数字越大, 计算成本就越高."

msgid ""
"**Fade In** allows adjusting the fade-in curve, which is useful to make the "
"contact area softer."
msgstr "**淡入** 允许调整淡入曲线, 这有助于使接触区域更柔和."

msgid ""
"**Fade Out** allows adjusting the fade-out curve, so the step limit fades "
"out softly."
msgstr "**淡出** 允许调整淡出曲线, 因此步长限制会轻微淡出."

msgid ""
"**Depth Tolerance** can be used for screen-space-ray hit tolerance to gaps. "
"The bigger the value, the more gaps will be ignored."
msgstr ""
"** Depth Tolerance ** 可用于屏幕空间射线对间隙的容差. 值越大, 忽略的差距就越"
"大."

msgid ""
"**Roughness** will apply a screen-space blur to approximate roughness in "
"objects with this material characteristic."
msgstr "**粗糙度** 将应用屏幕空间模糊来近似具有此材质特征的对象的粗糙度."

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that screen-space-reflections only work for reflecting opaque "
"geometry. Transparent materials won't be reflected, as they don't write to "
"the depth buffer. This also applies to shaders that use ``SCREEN_TEXTURE`` "
"or ``DEPTH_TEXTURE``."
msgstr ""
"请记住，屏幕空间反射仅适用于反射不透明几何体。透明对象无法反射，因为它们不会"
"写入深度缓冲。同样也适用于使用 ``SCREEN_TEXTURE`` 或 ``DEPTH_TEXTURE`` 的着色"
"器。"

msgid "Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)"
msgstr "屏幕空间环境遮挡(SSAO)"

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the **Ambient** section, areas where light from light nodes "
"does not reach (either because it's outside the radius or shadowed) are lit "
"with ambient light. Godot can simulate this using GIProbe, ReflectionProbe, "
"the Sky, or a constant ambient color. The problem, however, is that all the "
"methods proposed previously act more on a larger scale (large regions) than "
"at the smaller geometry level."
msgstr ""
"正如在 **环境** 部分提到的, 光节点的光线无法到达的区域会被环境光照亮(要么是因"
"为它在半径之外, 要么是阴影).Godot可以使用GIProbe, ReflectionProbe, Sky或恒定"
"的环境色来模拟这种情况. 但问题是, 之前提出的所有方法都更多地作用于较大的尺度"
"(大区域), 而不是较小的几何层面."

msgid ""
"Constant ambient color and Sky are the same everywhere, while GI and "
"Reflection probes have more local detail, but not enough to simulate "
"situations where light is not able to fill inside hollow or concave features."
msgstr ""
"恒定环境色和Sky在任何地方都是一样的, 而GI和反射探针的局部细节较多, 但不足以模"
"拟光线无法填充到中空或凹面特征内部的情况."

msgid ""
"This can be simulated with Screen Space Ambient Occlusion. As you can see in "
"the image below, its purpose is to make sure concave areas are darker, "
"simulating a narrower path for the light to enter:"
msgstr ""
"这可以用屏幕空间环境遮挡来模拟. 如下图所示, 它的目的是确保凹陷区域更暗, 模拟"
"光线进入的较窄路径:"

msgid ""
"It is a common mistake to enable this effect, turn on a light, and not be "
"able to appreciate it. This is because SSAO only acts on *ambient* light, "
"not direct light."
msgstr ""
"启用此效果, 打开灯光并且无法欣赏它是一个常见的错误. 这是因为 SSAO 仅作用于\\ "
"*环境光*\\ ，而不是直接光。"

msgid ""
"This is why, in the image above, the effect is less noticeable under the "
"direct light (on the left). If you want to force SSAO to work with direct "
"light too, use the **Light Affect** parameter (even though this is not "
"correct, some artists like how it looks)."
msgstr ""
"这就是为什么在上图中，直射光下效果不太明显的原因（在左边）。如果你想强制 "
"SSAO 也在直射光下工作，请使用 **Light Affect**\\ （光线影响）参数（尽管并这不"

msgstr ""
"**半径/强度:** 要控制遮挡的半径或强度, 可以使用这两个参数. 半径是世界(公制)单"

msgstr ""
"** Radius2 / Intensity2:** 可以使用辅助半径/强度. 结合大半径和小半径AO通常效"

msgid ""
"**Bias:** This can be tweaked to solve self occlusion, though the default "
"generally works well enough."
msgstr ""
"**偏置（Bias）：**\\ 这可以通过调整来解决自我遮挡问题，但默认情况下通常效果不"

msgstr ""
"**光线影响(Light Affect):** SSAO仅影响环境光线, 但增加此滑块可能会影响直射光"
"线. 有些艺术家喜欢这种效果."

msgid ""
"**Ao Channel Affect:** If a value of zero is used, only the material's AO "

"greater than 0 multiply the AO texture by the SSAO effect to varying "
"degrees. This does not affect materials without an AO texture."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""
"**质量(Quality):** 根据质量,SSAO将针对每个像素对球体进行更多采样. 高品质仅适"

msgid ""
"**Blur:** Type of blur kernel used. The 1x1 kernel is a simple blur that "
"preserves local detail better, but is not as efficient (generally works "
"better with the high quality setting above), while 3x3 will soften the image "
"better (with a bit of dithering-like effect), but does not preserve local "
