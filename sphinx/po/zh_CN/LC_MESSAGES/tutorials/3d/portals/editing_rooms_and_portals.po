msgid "Example SceneTree"
msgstr "示例 SceneTree"

msgid "Putting all the ideas together, here is an example scene tree:"
msgstr "综合所有内容，这就是一个示例场景树："

msgid ""
"We have used a :ref:`RoomGroup<class_RoomGroup>` to denote an outside area."
msgstr "我们使用一个 :ref:`RoomGroup<class_RoomGroup>` 来表示外部区域。"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`MeshInstance<class_MeshInstance>`\\ s inside the :ref:"
"`Room<class_Room>`\\ s are either ``STATIC`` or ``DYNAMIC``."
msgstr ""
":ref:`Room<class_Room>` 内部的 :ref:`MeshInstance<class_MeshInstance>` 不是 "
"``STATIC`` 就是 ``DYNAMIC``\\ 。"

msgid ""
"We have created a :ref:`Spatial<class_Spatial>` (I decided to call it "
"'Freeform', but you could use any name) under which to place ``STATIC`` and "
"``DYNAMIC`` objects that will be autoplaced in rooms (Freeform is inside the "
"``roomlist``, but *not* inside a room.)"
msgstr ""
"我们创建了一个 :ref:`Spatial<class_Spatial>`\\ （我决定称之为“Freeform”自由，"
"你可以随便起名）用来放置需要自动放置到房间里的 ``STATIC`` 和 ``DYNAMIC`` 对"
"象。（Freeform 在 ``roomlist`` 里，但\\ *不在*\\ 房间之中。）"

msgid "The player and the monsters are on branches *OUTSIDE* the ``roomlist``."
msgstr "玩家和怪物位于 ``roomlist`` *之外*\\ 的分支上。"

msgid ""
"The player and monster meshes have portal mode ``ROAMING`` so they can be in "
"any room."
msgstr "玩家和怪物网格的入口模式是 ``ROAMING``，因此可以进入任意房间。"

msgid "The camera is outside the ``roomlist``."
msgstr "相机位于 ``roomlist`` 之外。"

msgid "Creating room systems in Blender (or other modeling tools)"
msgstr "在 Blender 中创建房间系统（或者其他建模工具）"

msgid ""
"Although you can create your room system entirely within the editor, you can "
"also build rooms and portals within your modeling tool. There is one small "
"snag - modeling tools such as Blender have no knowledge of Room, RoomGroup "
"and Portal nodes. In order to work around this we use a series of naming "
"conventions. The first time Godot encounters these specially named nodes, it "
"will convert them into Rooms, RoomGroups and Portals."
msgstr ""
"你可以完全在编辑器中创建房间系统，也可以在建模工具中建立。有一个小问题--"
"Blender等建模工具不了解Room、RoomGroup和Portal节点。为了解决这个问题，我们使"
"用了一系列的命名规则。当Godot首次遇到这些命名特别的节点时，把它们转换成Room、"
"RoomGroups和Portals。"

msgid "Postfix convention"
msgstr "后缀约定"

msgid "``-room`` becomes a :ref:`Room<class_Room>`."
msgstr "``-room`` 变成 :ref:`Room<class_Room>`\\ 。"

msgid "``-roomgroup`` becomes a :ref:`RoomGroup<class_RoomGroup>`."
msgstr "``-roomgroup`` 变成 :ref:`RoomGroup<class_RoomGroup>`\\ 。"

msgid "``-portal`` becomes a :ref:`Portal<class_Portal>`."
msgstr "``-portal`` 变成 :ref:`Portal<class_Portal>`\\ 。"

msgid "``-bound`` becomes a manual bound."
msgstr "``-bound`` 变成手动边界。"

msgid ""
"Rooms and RoomGroups should be created as Empties within Blender. Any mesh "
"children of the ``-room`` Empty will thus be placed in the Room during "
"conversion in Godot."
msgstr ""
"Room 和 RoomGroup 在 Blender 中应该被创建为空物体。这样在 Godot 中进行转换"
"时，\\ ``-room`` 空物体的子网格就会被自动放进该房间。"

msgid "For example:"
msgstr "例如:"

msgid "``kitchen-room`` - create a Room called \"kitchen\"."
msgstr "``kitchen-room`` - 创建名为“kitchen”的 Room。"

msgid "``outside-roomgroup`` - create a RoomGroup called \"outside\"."
msgstr "``outside-roomgroup`` - 创建名为“outside”的 RoomGroup。"

msgid "``kitchen-portal`` - create a Portal leading to the \"kitchen\" Room."
msgstr "``kitchen-portal`` - 创建通向“kitchen”房间的 Portal。"

msgid "Portals"
msgstr "入口"

msgid ""
"Portals are different from Rooms. In Portals, we need to specify the "
"geometry of the Portal in our modelling tool, in addition to just the name. "
"To do this your \"portal-to-be\" should be created as a Mesh."
msgstr ""
"入口与房间不同。对于入口，除了名称之外，我们还需要在建模工具中指定入口的几何"
"形状。对于这点，你的“待建入口”应该被创建为网格。"

msgid ""
"Portal meshes have some restrictions to work properly. They must be convex, "
"and the polygon points should be in the same plane. The accuracy to the "
"plane does not have to be exact, as Godot will automatically average the "
"direction of the portal plane. Once converted to a :ref:"
"`Portal<class_Portal>` node, the snapping to the portal plane is enforced, "
"and the vertices are specified (and editable) as 2D coordinates in the "
"inspector, rather than 3D points."
msgstr ""
"为了正常工作，对入口的网格有一些限制。它们必须是凸的，并且多边形的点应该位于"
"同一平面。平面不必非常精确，因为 Godot 会自动对入口平面的方向求均值。 :ref:"
"`Portal<class_Portal>` 节点一旦转换完成，就会强制吸附到入口平面，顶点会以 2D "
"坐标而不是 3D 点的形式给出（编辑时亦然）。"

msgid ""
"The portal's naming is quite important. You can either name the portal ``-"
"portal`` which will attempt to autolink the Portal in Godot, or you can use "
"the name of the Room you wish to link the Portal to as a prefix."
msgstr ""
"入口的命名相当重要。你可以把入口命名为 ``-portal`` 让 Godot 尝试自动链接入"
"口，也可以把想要链接的房间名作为入口的前缀。"

msgid "Wildcard"
msgstr "通配符"

msgid ""
"In most cases, this can be done using a name such as ``kitchen-portal``. "
"However, there is one problem. Blender and Godot do not deal well when you "
"have multiple objects with the same name. What happens when we want more "
"than one Portal to lead to the kitchen?"
msgstr ""
"大多数情况下，用类似 ``kitchen-portal`` 这样的名字就可以了。然而还有一个问"
"题。Blender 和 Godot 并不善于处理多个对象名称相同的情况，那么我们想让厨房"
"（kitchen）的入口不止一个该怎么办呢？"

msgid ""
"The workaround is the use of a *wildcard* character, ``*``. When Godot reads "
"the wildcard, it will ignore anything placed after it in the name."
msgstr ""
"变通的方法是使用\\ *通配符* ``*``\\ 。Godot 读到名称中的通配符时，就会忽略后"
"续的内容。"

msgid "This means we can use the following portal names:"
msgstr "也就是说，我们可以使用如下的入口名称："

msgid "``kitchen*1-portal`` - creates a Portal leading to the \"kitchen\"."
msgstr "``kitchen*1-portal`` - 创建通往“kitchen”的 Portal。"

msgid ""
"``kitchen*2-portal`` - also creates a Portal leading to the \"kitchen\"."
msgstr "``kitchen*2-portal`` - 同样创建通往“kitchen”的 Portal。"

msgid "``kitchen*anything_you_want_here-portal`` - also works."
msgstr "``kitchen*anything_you_want_here-portal`` - 也行。"

msgid "Wildcards work on all of the nodes which use these naming conventions."
msgstr "使用这些命名约定的节点都支持使用通配符。"

msgid "Manual bounds"
msgstr "手动定界"

msgid ""
"Manual bounds are a way of explicitly setting the convex hull for a room, "
"and are used if they are present as children of a room in the scene tree. "
"Aside from the postfix, the naming is unimportant. They should be meshes (i."
"e. MeshInstance in Godot). Bear in mind they will be converted to convex "
"hulls during the conversion process, so they don't have to be perfect."
msgstr ""
"手动边界是一种为房间显式设置凸体的方式，如果它们作为场景树中房间的子项出现，"
"则会使用它们。除了后缀，命称并不重要。它们应该是网格，即 Godot 中的 "
"MeshInstance。注意，它们是在转换的过程中，转换为凸体，所以不一定完美。"

msgid ""
"Once used during conversion, they will be converted to the ``IGNORE`` "
"**Portal Mode** and won't be shown. You can alternatively use **Generate "
"Points** within the editor to convert these to a set of points stored in the "
"room, and delete the original ``-bound`` MeshInstance."
msgstr ""
"一旦在转换过程中使用，它们将被转换为 ``IGNORE`` \\ **入口模式**\\ ，不会被显"
"示。你也可以在编辑器中使用\\ **Generate Points**\\ ，将这些点转换为存储在房间"
"中的一组点，并删除原来的``-bound`` 网格实例。"

msgid "Portal point editing"
msgstr "编辑入口点"

msgid ""
"Portals are defined by a combination of the transform of the portal node, "
"and by a set of points which form the corners."
msgstr "入口由入口节点的变换和形成角的一组点的组合来定义。"

msgid "The default portal has 4 corners as shown in the inspector:"
msgstr "默认入口有 4 个角，检查器中会显示："

msgid ""
"You can edit these points in the gizmo or inspector to make a better match "
"to the opening in your game level. It's generally better to keep the number "
"of points as low as possible for the efficiency of the system. For example, "
"it's better to risk rendering a little too much than to spend the time "
"culling objects at 20 different edges."
msgstr ""
"您通过小工具或检查器来编辑这些点，以在游戏关卡的开场中有更好地匹配。为了提高"
"系统效率，通常，最好尽可能保持少的点。例如，与其花时间在 20 个不同的边上剔除"
"对象，不如尝试更多渲染。"

msgid "Room point editing"
msgstr "编辑房间点"

msgid ""
"You also have the option to manually edit the points used to define the "
"convex hull of a room. These points are not present by default. You would "
"typically create them by pressing the **Generate Points** button in the "
"editor toolbar when a room is selected. This will transfer the auto bound "
"from the geometry (or manual ``-bound`` mesh) into the inspector. Once there "
"are points in the inspector, they will be used and override any other "
"method. So if you wish to revert your manual editing, delete all the room's "
"points."
msgstr ""
"你也可以选择手动编辑用于定义房间凸体的点。这些点在默认情况下是不存在的。通常"
"选择一个房间，按下编辑器工具栏上的\\ **生成点**\\ 按钮来创建它们。这将把自动"
"绑定的几何体（或手动 ``-bound`` 的网格）转移到检查器中。一旦检查器中出现了"
"点，它们就会被使用，并覆盖其他的方式。因此，如果你想恢复手动编辑，请删除所有"
"房间的点。"

msgid ""
"Manually editing points can be useful in some situations, especially where "
"the auto-bound doesn't *quite* get the right result you want. It is usually "
"a good idea to use a lot of **Simplification** in the inspector for the Room "
"before generating the points. Be aware though that by default, the "
"**Simplification** value will be inherited from the RoomManager."
msgstr ""
"手动编辑点在某些情况下是有用的，尤其是在自动绑定不能\\ *完全*\\ 获得您想要的"
"正确结果的情况下。在生成点之前，在房间的检查器中使用大量\\ "
"**Simplification**\\ 通常是个好主意。注，默认情况下，\\ **Simplification**\\ "
"值将从RoomManager继承。"

msgid "RoomManager"
msgstr "RoomManager"

msgid "Show Debug"
msgstr "显示调试（Show Debug）"

msgid ""
"This can be used to control the amount of logging, especially the room "
"conversion logs. Debug will always be set to ``false`` on exported projects."
msgstr ""
"可以用来控制日志的量，尤其是房间转换日志。导出后的项目始终是 ``false``\\ 。"

msgid "Debug Sprawl"
msgstr "调试蔓延（Debug Sprawl）"

msgid ""
"This mode will only display meshes that are sprawling through portals from "
"the current camera room. Large statics that cross portals are usually the "
"ones you want to sprawl. Typical examples might be terrain mesh areas, or "
"large floor or ceiling meshes. You usually don't want things like door "
"frames to sprawl to the adjacent room - that is what fine tuning the "
"**Portal Margin** is for."
msgstr ""
"此模式将仅显示从当前相机房间穿过入口扩展的网格。通常想要扩展大型静态体跨入"
"口。典型示例可能是地形网格区域，或大型地板或天花板网格。通常不希望门框之类的"
"东西扩展到相邻的房间，这就是微调 **Portal Margin** 的目的。"

msgid "Merge Meshes"
msgstr "合并网格（Merge Meshes）"

msgid ""
"To keep drawcalls to a minimum, the system offers the option to "
"automatically merge similar ``STATIC`` meshes within a room (also known as "
"*static batching*). This can increase performance in many cases. The culling "
"accuracy is reduced, but as a room is a fairly logical unit for culling, "
"this trade off usually works in your favor."
msgstr ""
"为了让绘制调用保持最低，系统提供该选项，自动合并房间中相似的 ``STATIC`` 网格"
"（也被称作\\ *静态批处理*\\ ）。很多情况下都能提升性能。虽然降低了剔除的精"
"度，但是因为房间通常是剔除的逻辑单元，这样的折衷方案通常能帮到你。"

msgid "Plane Simplification"
msgstr "平面简化（Plane Simplification）"

msgid ""
"In some cases, the convex hulls automatically generated for rooms may "
"contain a very large number of planes, particularly if you use curved "
"surfaces. This is not ideal because it slows down the system. This option "
"can optionally simplify hulls. The degree of simplification can be selected "
"by the user, between ``0`` (no simplification) and ``1`` (maximum "
"simplification). You can also override this value in individual rooms."
msgstr ""
"部分情况下，根据房间自动生成的凸包轮廓可能包含大量平面，尤其是在使用了曲面的"
"时候。这种情况并不理想，因为会拖慢系统。本选项可以把外包轮廓简化。用户可以在 "
"``0``\\ （不简化）和 ``1``\\ （最简）之间选择简化的程度。也可以在单独的房间上"
"覆盖这个值。"

msgid "Portal Active"
msgstr "入口激活（Portal Active）"

msgid ""
"Portals can be turned on and off at runtime. This is especially useful if "
"you have doors that can open and close."
msgstr "入口可以在运行时打开和关闭。如果你有可以打开和关闭的房门，就很有用。"

msgid "Two Way"
msgstr "双向（Two Way）"

msgid ""
"Portals can either be two-way or one-way. The default two-way portals are "
"quicker to set up in most circumstances, but one-way portals can be useful "
"in some cases. For example, you can use one-way portals to create windows "
"that can be seen out of, but not seen into. This can help performance when "
"viewing buildings from outdoors."
msgstr ""
"入口可以是双向的也可以是单向的。在大多数情况下，默认的双向入口设置起来比较"
"快，但单向入口在某些情况下也很有用。例如，你可以使用单向入口来创建可以看到外"
"面，但看不到里面的窗口。这可以改善从室外查看建筑物的性能。"

msgid "Particle Systems"
msgstr "粒子系统"

msgid ""
"Be aware that when placing ``STATIC`` particle systems, the AABB on "
"conversion may have zero size. This means the particle system may be "
"unexpectedly culled early. To prevent this, either set the particle system "
"``portal mode`` to ``DYNAMIC``, or alternatively, add an **Extra Cull "
"Margin** to the particle system in the Geometry Inspector."
msgstr ""
"请注意，在放置 ``STATIC`` 粒子系统时，转换时的AABB尺寸可能是零。因此，粒子系"
"统可能会被意外地提前剔除。为了防止这种情况，可以将粒子系统的 ``portal mode`` "
"入口模式设置为 ``DYNAMIC`` ，或者在 几何检查器中为粒子系统添加额外的剔除边界"
"\\ **Extra Cull Margin**\\ 。"

msgid "Multimeshes"
msgstr "MultiMesh"

msgid ""
"Note that multimeshes will be culled as a group, rather than individually. "
"You should therefore attempt to keep them localised to the same area "
"wherever possible."
msgstr ""
"请注意，多重网格被当作一组剔除，而不是单独剔除，因此，你应该尽可能地将其保持"
"在同一区域内。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
