msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"This tutorial will introduce you to building a \"Hello World\" room system "
"with two rooms, and a portal in between."
msgstr ""
"本教程将向你介绍如何建立有两个房间的 \"Hello World\" 房间系统，以及中间的入"
"口。"

msgid "Step 1"
msgstr "第一步"

msgid "Create a new project."
msgstr "创建新项目。"

msgid ""
"Add a :ref:`Spatial<class_Spatial>` as the scene root (on the screenshot, "
"it's called \"Root\")."
msgstr ""
"添加一个 :ref:`Spatial<class_Spatial>` 作为场景根节点（截图里称作“Root”）。"

msgid ""
"Next add a :ref:`RoomManager<class_RoomManager>` node. We will need this "
"later to process the room system."
msgstr ""
"然后添加一个 :ref:`RoomManager<class_RoomManager>` 节点。我们后面处理房间系统"
"时会用到。"

msgid ""
"Next we need to start defining our rooms. We create all our rooms under "
"another Spatial we have called 'RoomList'."
msgstr ""
"然后我们就要开始定义我们的房间了。我们在另一个叫做“RoomList”（房间列表）的 "
"Spatial 节点下创建房间。"

msgid "Add a new :ref:`Room<class_Room>` node as a child of the roomlist."
msgstr "新建一个 :ref:`Room<class_Room>` 节点作为房间列表的子节点。"

msgid "We have named the room ``Kitchen``."
msgstr "我们把这个房间命名为 ``Kitchen``\\ （厨房）。"

msgid ""
"We will now create the geometry of our room. The names you give to the "
"geometry is up to you."
msgstr "我们现在来创建这个房间的几何体。几何体的名字你可以随便起。"

msgid ""
"Create a :ref:`MeshInstance<class_MeshInstance>` for the floor. Create a box "
"by adding a CubeMesh resource to the MeshInstance. Scale and position it to "
"form a floor."
msgstr ""
"创建一个 :ref:`MeshInstance<class_MeshInstance>` 作为地板。先给 MeshInstance "
"添加一个 CubeMesh 资源形成盒子，然后缩放平移成地板的样子。"

msgid ""
"Create MeshInstances for the walls. Create more box meshes for this, then "
"scale and position them. Be sure to leave an opening on one side. You will "
"need to create two wall segments to do this on that side."
msgstr ""
"为墙壁添加几个 MeshInstance。创建的应该也是盒子网格，然后缩放平移即可。记得留"
"一个开口，开口那一面墙需要分两段。"

msgid "Step 2"
msgstr "第二步"

msgid "Now we need to create the other room."
msgstr "现在我们需要创建另一个房间。"

msgid ""
"You can do this simply by duplicating the first room (select the ``Kitchen`` "
"node, right click and choose **Duplicate**)."
msgstr ""
"可以直接复制第一个房间（选择 ``Kitchen`` 节点，右键，然后选择\\ **制作副本"
"**\\ ）。"

msgid "Rotate and position the second room so that the openings line up."
msgstr "通过旋转平移第二个房间，把两个房间的开口对齐。"

msgid "Rename the second room to ``Lounge``."
msgstr "把第二个房间重命名为 ``Lounge``\\ （起居室）。"

msgid "Step 3"
msgstr "第三步"

msgid "Next, we will add a portal between the two rooms."
msgstr "接下来，我们要在两个房间之间添加一个入口。"

msgid "Create a new :ref:`Portal<class_Portal>` in the kitchen."
msgstr "在厨房中新建一个 :ref:`Portal<class_Portal>`\\ 。"

msgid ""
"Scale and position the portal using the node ``Transform`` in the inspector, "
"so it fits within the opening between the two rooms."
msgstr ""
"使用检查器中的节点的 ``Transform`` 来调整入口的缩放和坐标，使其适合两个房间之"
"间的开口。"

msgid ""
"The portal plane should face *outward* from the source room, i.e. towards "
"the lounge. This direction is indicated by the arrow in the editor gizmo, "
"and portal gizmo's color."
msgstr ""
"入口的平面应该朝向源房间的 *外侧* ，也就是朝向休息室。这个方向由编辑器中的箭"
"头和入口的颜色表示。"

msgid "Step 4"
msgstr "第四步"

msgid ""
"To make things more exciting, we want to add a few more boxes to the rooms."
msgstr "为了更有趣，我们在房间里多加几个盒子。"

msgid ""
"Placing these boxes as children or grandchildren of the room nodes "
"explicitly tells the system which room the objects should be in. However, we "
"can also create these objects *outside* the rooms. Provided they are in the "
"RoomList branch, the system will attempt to automatically place them in the "
"correct room at runtime."
msgstr ""
"将这些盒子作为房间节点的子节点或孙节点，明确告知系统这些对象应该在哪个房间。"
"然而，我们也可以在房间之外创建这些对象。只要它们在房间列表分支当中，系统就会"
"尝试在运行时自动将它们放在正确的房间中。"

msgid ""
"On the screenshot, the boxes were places as children of a Spatial I have "
"called ``Freeform`` to keep things tidy."
msgstr "在截图中，这些盒子是作为名为 ``Freeform`` 空间的子项，以保持整洁。"

msgid ""
"Boxes also have a green SpatialMaterial assigned to them to make them stand "
"out more from the rest of the room."
msgstr "给盒子分配绿色的 SpatialMaterial，以使其在房间中突显。"

msgid ""
"Let's also create an :ref:`OmniLight<class_OmniLight>` so it will be "
"autoplaced in one of the rooms."
msgstr ""
"我们再创建一个 :ref:`OmniLight<class_OmniLight>`，它将被自动放置在其中一个房"
"间中。"

msgid "Step 5"
msgstr "第五步"

msgid ""
"Next comes a crucial stage. We must let the RoomManager know where the rooms "
"are!"
msgstr "接下来是关键阶段。我们必须让RoomManager房间管理器知道房间在哪里!"

msgid ""
"Select the RoomManager and look in the Inspector window in the **Paths** "
"section."
msgstr "选择RoomManager，查看检查器窗口的\\ **Paths**\\ 部分。"

msgid ""
"You need to assign the **Room List** to point to the RoomList node we "
"created earlier (which is the parent of all the rooms)."
msgstr ""
"你需要将\\ **Room List**\\ 指向我们之前创建的RoomList节点，RoomList是所有房间"
"的父节点。"

msgid "Step 6"
msgstr "第六步"

msgid ""
"Make sure you have saved your project before this next step. It is always a "
"good idea to save and make a backup before converting."
msgstr ""
"确保在进行下一步之前，你已经保存了项目。在转换之前，最好总是保存并做备份。"

msgid ""
"Select the RoomManager, and you will see a button in the toolbar at the top "
"of the 3d editor viewport called **Convert Rooms**. Press this button."
msgstr ""
"选择RoomManager，你会在3D编辑器视窗顶部的工具栏中看到一个按钮，叫做\\ "
"**Convert Rooms**\\ ，按下这个按钮。"

msgid ""
"If all goes well, the RoomManager will have created the runtime data (the "
"*room graph*) to perform occlusion culling at runtime."
msgstr ""
"如果一切顺利，RoomManager将创建运行时数据（ \\ *房间图*\\ ），以便在运行时进"
"行遮挡剔除。"

msgid ""
"You can see a log of the conversion process in the output window. This is "
"helpful for finding problems."
msgstr "您可以在输出窗口中看到转换过程的日志。这有助于发现问题。"

msgid ""
"If you now move the editor camera inside the rooms, you should see the "
"meshes in the opposite room being culled depending on what you can see "
"through the portal."
msgstr ""
"如果你现在在房间内移动编辑器相机，应该可以看到对面房间的网格被剔除，是取决于"
"你通过入口所能看到的东西。"

msgid "Conclusion"
msgstr "总结"

msgid ""
"This concludes this simple tutorial. Don't be afraid to experiment with the "
"new room system you have created."
msgstr "这个简单的教程到此结束。你可以尝试创建的新房间系统。"

msgid "Some things to try"
msgstr "试一试"

msgid ""
"Create different types of geometry. CSG nodes, Particle systems, and "
"Multimeshes are all supported by the portal system."
msgstr "创建不同类型的几何体。入口系统支持 CSG 节点、粒子系统和多重网格。"

msgid ""
"Try creating a Camera and adding it to the scene. If you run the scene you "
"will notice that the portal culling is not active. This is because the "
"``room graph`` must be created each time you load a level, by converting the "
"rooms. Instead of using a button in the editor, in real games you call a "
"function in the RoomManager to convert the level, called "
"``rooms_convert()``. Try this out with a script, perhaps running within a "
"``_ready()`` function."
msgstr ""
"尝试创建相机并将其添加到场景中。如果运行场景，您会注意到入口剔除未处于活动状"
"态。这是因为每次加载关卡时都必须通过转换房间来创建房间数据 ``room "
"graph``\\ 。在实际游戏中，您无需在编辑器中使用按钮，而是通过 RoomManager 调用"
"函数来转换关卡， ``rooms_convert()``\\ 。使用脚本试用此内容，也许是在 "
"``_ready()`` 函数中运行。"

msgid ""
"The geometry you created so far is all ``STATIC`` (non-moving). If you look "
"in the inspector for geometry nodes, you will see they derive from "
"``CullInstance``. Here you can set the **Portal Mode** for objects in the "
"portal system. This determines how the node is processed."
msgstr ""
"到目前为止，你创建的几何体都是 ``STATIC``\\ （非移动的）。如果在检查器中查看"
"几何体节点，你会看到它们源自 ``CullInstance``\\ 。你可以为入口系统中的对象设"
"置\\ **入口模式**\\ ，其决定了节点的处理方式。"

msgid ""
"If you now write a script to move one of your objects within a room and view "
"it through a Camera as the scene runs, you may notice that the object gets "
"culled incorrectly. This is because ``STATIC`` objects are assumed not to "
"move in the system. If you instead change the object to ``DYNAMIC``, it "
"should now update the culling correctly."
msgstr ""
"如果你现在写一个脚本，在房间里移动一个对象，并在场景运行时，通过相机查看，你"
"可能会注意到这个对象被错误地剔除了。这是因为 ``STATIC`` 对象被认为不会在系统"
"中移动。如果你把这个对象改为 ``DYNAMIC`` 后，应该能正确地更新剔除。"

msgid ""
"There are several ``portal_modes``, these are described in the main "
"documentation."
msgstr "有几种 ``portal_modes`` ，在主文档中有描述。"

msgid ""
"Try turning the portal on and off at runtime from your script. You can call "
"``set_portal_active()`` to open and close the portal."
msgstr "试着在运行时，从脚本中调用 ``set_portal_active()`` 来打开和关闭入口。"

msgid ""
"If you select the portal, you should see 4 handles appear. Try dragging the "
"portal points with the mouse, and see how it affects the objects that are "
"culled."
msgstr ""
"如果你选择了入口，应该可能看到出现4个手柄。试着用鼠标拖动入口的点，看看它对被"
"剔除的对象有什么影响。"

msgid ""
"If you select a room and click the **Generate Points** button in the "
"toolbar, it will store the points of the room hull in the room inspector. "
"You can now edit these with the gizmo handles."
msgstr ""
"如果你选择一个房间并点击工具栏上的\\ **Generate Points**\\ 按钮，它将把房间外"
"体的点储存在房间的检查器中。你现在可以用辅助工具手柄来编辑这些点。"
