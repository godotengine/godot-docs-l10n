msgid "Introduction to Rooms and Portals"
msgstr "房间和入口的介绍"

msgid ""
"The rooms and portals system is an optional component of Godot that allows "
"you to partition your 3D game levels into a series of :ref:"
"`Room<class_Room>` s (*aka cells*), and :ref:`Portal<class_Portal>` s. "
"Portals are openings between the rooms that the :ref:`Camera<class_Camera>` "
"(and lights) can see through."
msgstr ""
"房间（Room）和入口（Portal）系统是 Godot 的可选组件，它允许您将 3D 游戏关卡划"
"分为一系列 :ref:`Room<class_Room>`\\ （\\ *即单间*\\ ）和 :ref:"
"`Portal<class_Portal>`\\ 。入口是房间之间的开口，\\ :ref:`相机 "
"<class_Camera>`\\ （和灯光）可以通过这个开口看到另一个房间。"

msgid "This allows several features:"
msgstr "可以用来实现许多功能："

msgid ""
"**Portal occlusion culling**, which can increase performance by reducing the "
"number of objects that are drawn, both to cameras and to shadow maps."
msgstr ""
"**入口遮挡剔除**\\ ，可以减少绘制对象的数量来提高性能，包括相机和阴影贴图。"

msgid ""
"**Gameplay callbacks**, which allow turning off activity outside the "
"gameplay area - AI, physics, animation, processing etc."
msgstr "**游戏回调**\\ ，允许关闭游戏区域以外的活动——AI、物理、动画、过程等。"

msgid ""
"The trade off for these features is that we have to manually partition our "
"level into rooms, and add portals between them."
msgstr "这些功能的代价是，必须手动将关卡划分为房间，并在房间之间添加入口。"

msgid ""
"Godot portals should not be confused with those in the `game of the same "
"name <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)>`__. They do not "
"warp space, they simply represent a window that the camera (or lights) can "
"see through."
msgstr ""
"Godot 的入口（Portal）不应与\\ `同名游戏 <https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"%E5%82%B3%E9%80%81%E9%96%80>`__\\ 混淆。它们不会扭曲空间，只是表示相机（或灯"
"光）可以透过的窗口。"

msgid "Minimizing manual labour"
msgstr "尽量减少手动操作"

msgid ""
"Although the effort involved in creating rooms for a large level may seem "
"daunting, there are several factors which can make this much easier:"
msgstr ""
"尽管为大关卡创建房间所涉及的工作似乎令人生畏，但有几项因素可以使这变得更容易"
"些："

msgid ""
"If you are \"kit bashing\" and reusing rooms or areas already, this is an "
"ideal way to save effort. Your level tiles can be rooms, with portals "
"already placed."
msgstr ""
"如果您使用的是现成资产库，已经在重复使用房间或区域，这是节省精力的理想方式。"
"您可以把关卡图块用作房间，并且已经放置了入口。"

msgid ""
"If you are creating procedural levels, you can create rooms and portals as "
"part of the procedural generation algorithm you're writing."
msgstr ""
"如果你正在创建程序式关卡，你可以创建房间和入口，作为你正在编写的程序式生成算"
"法的一部分。"

msgid ""
"Finally, if you are manually creating freeform levels, bear in mind there "
"are absolutely no rules as to how far you go with portalling. Even if you "
"separate a large game level into only two rooms, with a single portal "
"between them, this can still result in relatively large performance gains."
msgstr ""
"那么，如果您手动创建自由形式的关卡，请记住，对于入口的使用没有任何规定。即使"
"你将一个大型游戏关卡分成两个房间，它们之间只有一个入口，这仍然可以带来相对较"
"大的性能提升。"

msgid ""
"The performance benefits (especially in terms of occlusion) follow an L-"
"shaped curve, with the lion's share occurring when you have created just a "
"few rooms. So do not be afraid to be lazy - **\\*work smart\\***."
msgstr ""
"性能优势遵循 L 型曲线（特别是在遮挡方面），当你仅创建几个房间后，大部分优势就"
"能体现。因此，不要害怕偷懒——\\ **\\*工作让人聪明\\***\\ 。"

msgid ""
"In general, when it comes to medium and large-sized levels, it is better to "
"do a little portalling than none at all."
msgstr "一般来说，当涉及到中型和大型关卡时，做一点入口总比不做要好。"

msgid "Some caveats"
msgstr "一些注意事项"

msgid ""
"The portal system should be considered an **advanced feature** of Godot. You "
"should not attempt to use rooms and portals until you are familiar with the "
"Godot editor, and have successfully made at least a couple of test games."
msgstr ""
"入口系统应被视为 Godot 的\\ **高级功能**\\ 。在熟悉 Godot 编辑器并成功制作出"
"几个测试游戏之前，你不应该尝试使用房间和入口。"

msgid ""
"It gives you great power as a game designer, but the trade off is that it "
"requires a very technical approach to level design. It is aimed at producing "
"professional-grade results, and assumes the user is prepared to put in the "
"work for this. It is not intended to be used for all 3D games. Not all games "
"will significantly benefit from portals, and it may require more time than a "
"short game jam allows."
msgstr ""
"作为游戏设计师，它给了你很大的权力，但代价是，它需要具有非常好的关卡设计技"
"巧。它的目标是产生专业级的结果，并假定用户准备为此付出努力。它并不打算用于所"
"有的 3D 游戏。并非所有的游戏都能从中明显受益，而且，它所需要的时间可能比短期"
"游戏竞赛要多。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
