"Although occlusion culling greatly reduces the number of objects that need "
"to be rendered, there are other costs to maintaining objects in a game "
"besides the final rendering. For instance, in Godot, animated objects will "
"still be animated whether they appear on screen or not. This can take up a "
"lot of processing power, especially for objects that use software skinning "
"(where skinning is calculated on the CPU)."
msgstr ""
"尽管遮挡剔除大大减少了需要渲染的对象数量，但除了最终渲染之外，在游戏中维护对"
"象还有其他成本。例如，在 Godot 中，无论是否出现在屏幕上，动画对象仍然会被动画"
"化。这会占用大量处理能力，尤其是对于使用软件蒙皮的对象（蒙皮在 CPU 中计算）。"

msgid "Fear not, rooms and portals can solve these problems, and more."
msgstr "不要担心，房间和入口可以解决这些问题，还有别的。"

msgid ""
"By building our system of rooms for our game level, not only do we have the "
"information needed for occlusion culling, we also have handily created the "
"information required to know which rooms are in the local \"gameplay area\" "
"of the player (or camera). If you think about it, in a lot of cases, there "
"is no need to do a lot of simulation on objects that have nothing to do with "
"gameplay."
msgstr ""
"通过为我们的游戏关卡构建房间系统，我们不仅拥有遮挡剔除所需的信息，还轻松创建"
"了了解哪些房间位于玩家（或相机）的局部 \"gameplay area\" 游戏区域所需的信息."
"仔细想想，在很多情况下，不需要对与游戏玩法无关的对象进行大量模拟。"

msgid ""
"The gameplay area is not confined to just the objects you can see in front "
"of you. AI monsters behind you still need to attack you when your back is "
"turned! In Godot the gameplay area is defined as the *potentially visible "
"set* (PVS) of rooms, from the room you are currently within. That is, if "
"there is any part of a room that can possibly be viewed from any part of the "
"room you are in (even from a corner), it is considered within the PVS, and "
"hence the gameplay area."
msgstr ""
"游戏区域并不局限于你面前可以看到的物体。你身后的AI怪物仍然需要在你转身的时候"
"攻击你。在Godot中，游戏区域被定义为从你当前所在的房间开始的房间的 *潜在可见集"
"合* （PVS） 。也就是说，如果房间的任意部分可以从你所在的房间的任何部分看到"
"（甚至从一个角落），它就被认为是在PVS之内，因此也是游戏区域。"

msgid ""
"This works because if a monster is in an area that is completely out of view "
"for yourself or the monster, you are less likely to care what it is doing."
msgstr ""
"这是有效的，因为如果怪物在你自己或怪物完全看不见的区域，你就不太可能关心它在"
"做什么。"

msgid "How does a monster know whether it is within the gameplay area?"
msgstr "怪物如何知道它是否在游戏区域内？"

msgid ""
"This problem is solved because the portal system contains a subsystem called "
"the **Gameplay Monitor** that can be turned on and off from the :ref:"
"`RoomManager<class_RoomManager>`. When switched on, any roaming objects that "
"move inside or outside the gameplay area (whether by moving themselves, or "
"the camera moving) will receive callbacks to let them know of this change."
msgstr ""
"这个问题是有解的，入口系统包含称为 **Gameplay Monitor** 的游戏监控子系统，可"
"以从 :ref:`RoomManager<class_RoomManager>` 中打开或关闭。当开启时，任何在游戏"
"区域内外移动的漫游对象都会收到回调（无论是通过移动自己，还是摄像机移动），让"
"他们知道这一变化。"

msgid ""
"You can choose to either receive these callbacks as ``signals``, or as "
"``notifications``."
msgstr "你可以选择以 ``signals`` 或 ``notifications`` 的方式接收这些回调。"

msgid "Notifications can be handled in GDScript or other scripting languages:"
msgstr "通知可以用GDScript或其他脚本语言来处理:"

msgid ""
"Signals are sent just as any other signal. They can be attached to functions "
"using the editor inspector. The signals are called ``gameplay_entered`` and "
"``gameplay_exited``."
msgstr ""
"信号的发送就像其他信号一样。可以使用编辑器检查器附加到函数中。信号名为 "
"``gameplay_entered`` 和 ``gameplay_exited``\\ 。"

msgid ""
"In fact, you don't just receive these callbacks for ``ROAMING`` objects. In "
"addition Rooms and RoomGroups (which can be used to form groups of rooms) "
"can also receive callbacks. For example, you can use this to trigger AI "
"behaviour when the player reaches certain points in a level."
msgstr ""
"事实上，不仅是这些 ``ROAMING`` 对象的收到回调。此外，房间和房间组也可以接收回"
"调。例如，当玩家达到某个关卡的特定点时，您可以使用它来触发 AI 行为。"

msgid "VisbilityNotifiers / VisibilityEnablers"
msgstr "VisbilityNotifier / VisibilityEnabler"

msgid ""
"Gameplay callbacks have one more useful function. By default in Godot, "
"animation and physics are still processed regardless of whether an object is "
"within view. This can sap performance, especially when using software "
"skinning."
msgstr ""
"游戏回调还有一个有用的功能。在Godot中，默认情况下，无论物体是否在视野内，动画"
"和物理都会被处理。这可能会降低性能，特别是在使用软件换肤时。"

msgid ""
"The engine's solution to this problem is the :ref:"
"`VisibilityNotifier<class_VisibilityNotifier>` node, and its slightly easier "
"to use variation, the :ref:`VisibilityEnabler<class_VisibilityEnabler>` "
"node. VisibilityEnabler can be used to switch off animation and sleep "
"physics when an object is outside the view frustum. You do this by simply "
"placing a VisibilityEnabler node in your subscene (for e.g. a monster). It "
"will do the rest. Consult the :ref:"
"`VisibilityEnabler<class_VisibilityEnabler>` documentation for full details."
msgstr ""
"引擎对这个问题的解决方案是 :ref:"
"`VisibilityNotifier<class_VisibilityNotifier>` 节点，以及稍微容易使用的它的变"
"体， :ref:`VisibilityEnabler<class_VisibilityEnabler>` 节点。"
"VisibilityEnabler可以用来关闭动画和休眠物理，当一个物体在视野范围之外时。你只"
"需要在子场景中放置一个VisibilityEnabler节点就可以做到这一点（例如，一个怪"
"物）。它将完成剩下的工作。请查阅 :ref:"
"`VisibilityEnabler<class_VisibilityEnabler>` 文档，以了解详细内容。"

msgid ""
"What if the VisibilityEnabler could turn off objects when they were "
"occlusion culled? Well it turns out VisibilityEnabler can. All you have to "
"do is enable the **Gameplay Monitor** in the RoomManager and the rest "
"happens automatically."
msgstr ""
"那么在VisibilityEnabler对象被遮挡时能关闭它们吗？是的，可以，你所要做的就是在"
"RoomManager中启用\\ **Gameplay Monitor**\\ ，就会自动进行。"

msgid "RoomGroups"
msgstr "RoomGroup"

msgid ""
"A :ref:`RoomGroup<class_RoomGroup>` is a special node which allows you to "
"deal with a group of rooms at once, instead of having write code for them "
"individually. This is especially useful in conjunction with gameplay "
"callbacks. The most important use for RoomGroups is to delineate between "
"\"inside\" and \"outside\" areas."
msgstr ""
":ref:`RoomGroup<class_RoomGroup>` 是一个特殊的节点，它允许你一次处理一组房"
"间，而不必单独书写代码。这在与游戏回调相结合时，很有用。RoomGroups房间组最重"
"要的用途是划分 \"内部\" 和 \"外部\" 区域。"

msgid ""
"For instance, when outside you may wish to use a :ref:"
"`DirectionalLight<class_DirectionalLight>` to represent the sun. When the "
"outside RoomGroup receives an ``enter gameplay`` callback, you can turn the "
"light on, and you can turn it off when the RoomGroup exits gameplay. With "
"the light off, performance will increase as there is no need to render it "
"indoors."
msgstr ""
"例如，当在外部时，你可能希望使用一个 :ref:"
"`DirectionalLight<class_DirectionalLight>` 来表示太阳。当外部的房间组收到 "
"``enter gameplay`` 回调时，你可以打开灯，当房间组退出游戏时，把它关掉。关闭灯"
"光后，会提高性能，因为不需要在室内渲染。"

msgid ""
"This is an example of a simple RoomGroup script to turn on and off a "
"DirectionalLight. Note that you can also use signals for callbacks (the "
"choice is up to you):"
msgstr ""
"这是一个简单的RoomGroup房间组脚本的例子，用来打开和关闭平行光照。注，你也可以"
"选择使用信号进行回调:"

msgid ""
"You can apply the same technique for switching on and off weather effects, "
"skyboxes and much more."
msgstr "你可以应用同样的方式来打开和关闭天气效果、天空盒和更多。"

msgid "Internal Rooms"
msgstr "内部房间"

msgid ""
"There is one more trick that RoomGroups have up their sleeve. A very common "
"desire is to have a game level with a mixed outdoor and indoor environment. "
"We have already mentioned that rooms can be used to represent both rooms in "
"a building, and areas of landscape, such as a canyon."
msgstr ""
"还有一个技巧，房间组有他们的管道。一个常见需求是有室外和室内混合环境的游戏关"
"卡。我们已经提到，房间可以用来表示建筑物房间，以及景观区域，如峡谷。"

msgid "What happens if you wish to have a house in a terrain 'room'?"
msgstr "如果你希望在地形 '房间' 里有房屋，怎么做？"

msgid ""
"With the functionality described so far you *can* do it - you would need to "
"place portals around the exterior of the house though, forming needless "
"rooms above the house. This has been done in many games. But what if there "
"was a simpler way?"
msgstr ""
"使用到目前为止描述的功能，你\\ *可以*\\ 做到这点，不过，你需要在房间的外部放"
"置入口，在房间上方形成不必要的房间。这在很多游戏中都做过。但是有没有更简单的"
"方法呢？"

msgid ""
"It turns out there is a simpler way of handling this scenario. Godot "
"supports *rooms **within** rooms* (we will call them **\"internal "
"rooms\"**). That is, you can place a house within a terrain room, or even a "
"building, or set of buildings, and even have exit portals in different "
"terrain rooms!"
msgstr ""
"事实证明，有一种更简单的方法来处理这种情况。Godot 支持 *房间**套**房间*\\ "
"（称为 **“内部房间”**）。也就是说，你可以在地形房间内放置房子，甚至一栋建筑或"
"一组建筑，在不同的地形房间内设置出口！"

msgid ""
"To create internal rooms, you don't need to place a room within another room "
"in the scene tree - in fact you will get a warning if you try this. Instead, "
"create them as regular rooms. The internal rooms should be grouped together "
"with a RoomGroup as parent. If you look in the inspector for the RoomGroup, "
"there is a **Room Group Priority** which defaults to ``0``."
msgstr ""
"要创建内部房间，不需要在场景树把一个房间放置在另一个房间中，事实上，如果您尝"
"试这样做，将收到警告。而是，将它们创建为常规房间。内部房间应该与父级房间组进"
"行组合。查看房间组属性，会看到 **Room Group Priority** 默认为 ``0``\\ 。"

msgid ""
"If you want a room or set of rooms to be internal, set the priority to a "
"higher value than the outer (enclosing) room, using the RoomGroup."
msgstr ""
"如果您希望一个房间或一组房间位于内部，请使用房间组，将优先级设置为高于外部封"
"闭房间的值。"

msgid ""
"The system uses the priority setting to give priority to the internal room "
"when deciding which room a camera or object is within. Higher priority "
"*always* wins. Everything else works in a mostly similar way."
msgstr ""
"在决定摄像机或物体位于哪个房间时，系统按照优先级设置优先考虑内部房间。更高优"
"先级的 *总是* 获得。其他的都以类似的方式工作。"

msgid "The only differences:"
msgstr "仅有的差别："

msgid ""
"Portals between internal rooms and outer rooms should always *be placed in "
"the inner (internal) room*."
msgstr "内部房间和外部房间之间的入口应该总是\\ *放在内部房间*\\ 。"

msgid ""
"Portals of internal rooms are not considered as part of the bound of outer "
"rooms."
msgstr "内部房间的入口不视为外部房间范围的一部分。"

msgid ""
"``STATIC`` and ``DYNAMIC`` objects from outer rooms will not sprawl into "
"internal rooms. If you want objects to cross these portals, place them in "
"the internal room. This is to prevent large objects like terrain sections "
"sprawling into entire buildings, and rendering when not necessary."
msgstr ""
"来自外部房间的 ``STATIC`` 和 ``DYNAMIC`` 对象不会扩展到内部房间。如果您希望物"
"体穿过这些入口，请将它们放置在内部房间中。这是为了防止大型物体（如地形部分）"
"扩展到整个建筑物，而在不需要时渲染。"

msgid "Internal room example"
msgstr "内部房间示例"

msgid ""
"The tent is a simple room inside a terrain room (which contains the ground, "
"the trees etc)."
msgstr "帐篷是位于地形房间（包含地面和树等）中的简单的房间。"

msgid ""
"To use internal rooms for buildings, it is usually a good idea to split the "
"*interior* mesh of the building from the *exterior*. The exterior can be "
"placed in the outer room (so it can be seen from outside, but not from the "
"inside), and the interior should be placed in the interior room (so it only "
"visible inside, or through the portal)."
msgstr ""
"使用内部房间作为建筑时，一般最好是把建筑的\\ *内部*\\ 网格和\\ *外部*\\ 分"
"开。外部网格可以放在外部房间里（这样在外面就可以看到，而在里面看不到），内部"
"网格应该放在内部房间里（所以只能在内部或者通过入口看到）。"

msgid ""
"This is perfect for improving performance in open world games. Often your "
"buildings can be scenes (including the rooms and portals) that can be "
"reused. When viewed from the outside, interiors will mostly be culled, and "
"when viewing from the inside other buildings and most of the outside will be "
"culled. The same goes for other players and objects that are inside and "
"outside the buildings."
msgstr ""
"这非常适合提高开放世界游戏的性能。通常，您的建筑物可以是重复使用的场景，包括"
"房间和入口。从外面看，内部大部分会被剔除，而从内部看其他建筑物和外面的大部分"
"都会被剔除。建筑物内外的其他玩家和物体也是同样。"

msgid ""
"Let us look in detail at another practical example for an open world. We "

msgstr ""
"我们来仔细看一个开放世界的应用实例。我们想把房子（作为内部房间）放到岛上，并"

msgid ""
"We have created a Room node (which will become the internal room) into which "
"we have placed the interior meshes. We have also created a Portal with no "
"links (so autolinking will be used). The exterior mesh is *not* within the "
"room. It will be autoplaced, and we are intending for it to be placed within "
"the outer room."
msgstr ""
"我们创建了一个 Room 节点（会用作内部房间）并在其中放置内部网格。同时我们也创"
"建了一个未链接的 Portal（所以会进行自动链接）。外部网格\\ *不在*\\ 这个房间"
"里。它会被自动放置到外部房间里，我们也是这样期望的。"

msgid ""
"However there is a problem. The naive autoplace algorithm will look at the "
"center of the exterior mesh, and attempt to place it *within* the internal "
"room. We want to avoid this somehow, as the idea of the exterior mesh is to "
"have something rendered from the outside, so it must be in the outer room "
"for everything to work."
msgstr ""
"然而问题来了。朴素的自动放置算法会根据外部网格的中心点的位置，去尝试把它\\ *"
"放进*\\ 内部房间。我们得想办法避免这种情况，因为外部网格的意义就是让它在外面"
"渲染，所以必须放在外部房间里才行。"

msgid ""
"To get around this problem, there is a special setting to enable you to "
"express a preference for autoplacing in an outer room. Each object has an "
"**Autoplace Priority** setting. When set to ``0``, there is no preference "
"(the object will be placed in the highest priority room)."
msgstr ""
"要解决这个问题，有一个特殊的设置，可以让你表达对自动放置到外部房间的偏好。每"
"个对象都有一个 **Autoplace Priority**\\ （自动放置优先级）的设置。设为 ``0`` "
"时没有偏好（对象会被放置到优先级最高的房间里）。"

msgid ""
"However, if we set this autoplace priority to ``-1`` for example, the "
"autoplace will always choose a ``-1`` priority room (if one is present at "
"that location). So if we set the outer room priority to ``-1``, it will "
"always place our exterior into our \"outside\" room."
msgstr ""
"而如果我们把这个自动放置优先级设成 ``-1``\\ ，那么自动放置时就会始终选择优先"
"级为 ``-1`` 的房间（该位置存在这样的房间的话）。所以如果我们把外部房间的优先"
"级设为 ``-1`` ，就会始终把外部网格放到我们的“外部”房间了。"

msgid ""
"This gives us a helpful extra bit of control for these kinds of situations, "
"and makes the entire system much more flexible."
msgstr ""
"有了这个设置，我们就可以在类似的情况下执行进一步的控制，非常有用，整个系统也"
"变得更加灵活。"

msgid ""
"As the default autoplace priority is ``0``, you can't effectively force "
"objects into RoomGroups with priority ``0``. However there are plenty of "
"priority values available so this should not be a problem in practice."
msgstr ""
"因为默认的自动放置优先级是 ``0``\\ ，你很难把对象强制放进优先级为 ``0`` 的 "
"RoomGroup 里。不过可用的优先级还有很多，所以在实践中应该不是问题。"

msgid ""
"The final scene looks something like this, with houses instanced wherever "
"you want them on a giant outer room."
msgstr "最终的场景看上去就像这样，在巨大的外部房间里实例化了很多房子。"
