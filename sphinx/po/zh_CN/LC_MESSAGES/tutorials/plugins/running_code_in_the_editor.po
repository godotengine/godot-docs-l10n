msgid "What is ``@tool``?"
msgstr "``@tool`` 是什么？"

msgid ""
"``@tool`` is a powerful line of code that, when added at the top of your "
"script, makes it execute in the editor. You can also decide which parts of "
"the script execute in the editor, which in game, and which in both."
msgstr ""
"``@tool`` 是一行强大的代码，添加到脚本的顶部后，脚本就会在编辑器中执行。你还"
"可以决定脚本的哪些部分在编辑器中执行、哪些部分在游戏中执行、哪部分在两者中均"
"执行。"

msgid ""
"You can use it for doing many things, but it is mostly useful in level "
"design for visually presenting things that are hard to predict ourselves. "
"Here are some use cases:"
msgstr ""
"你可以使用它来做很多事情, 它在层次设计中非常有用, 可以直观地呈现难以预测的事"
"物. 以下是一些用例:"

msgid ""
"If you have a cannon that shoots cannonballs affected by physics (gravity), "
"you can draw the cannonball's trajectory in the editor, making level design "
"a lot easier."
msgstr ""
"如果你有一门发射受物理学(重力)影响的炮弹的大炮, 你可以在编辑器中画出炮弹的轨"
"迹, 使关卡设计容易得多."

msgid ""
"If you have jumppads with varying jump heights, you can draw the maximum "
"jump height a player would reach if it jumped on one, also making level "
"design easier."
msgstr ""
"如果你有不同跳跃高度的跳线, 你可以绘制游戏角色能跳过的最大跳跃高度, 也可以让"
"关卡设计变得更容易."

msgid ""
"If your player doesn't use a sprite, but draws itself using code, you can "
"make that drawing code execute in the editor to see your player."
msgstr ""
"如果你的游戏角色不使用精灵, 却使用代码来绘制, 你可以在编辑器中执行该绘图代码"
"以查看你的游戏角色."

msgid ""
"``@tool`` scripts run inside the editor, and let you access the scene tree "
"of the currently edited scene. This is a powerful feature which also comes "
"with caveats, as the editor does not include protections for potential "
"misuse of ``@tool`` scripts. Be **extremely** cautious when manipulating the "
"scene tree, especially via :ref:`Node."
"queue_free<class_Node_method_queue_free>`, as it can cause crashes if you "
"free a node while the editor runs logic involving it."
msgstr ""
"``tool`` 脚本在编辑器内运行, 让你访问当前编辑的场景树. 这是一个强大的功能, 但"
"也有一些注意事项, 因为编辑器不包括对 ``tool`` 脚本潜在滥用的保护. 在操作场景"
"树时, 尤其是通过 :ref:`Node.queue_free<class_Node_method_queue_free>` 时, 要 "
"**极其** 谨慎, 因为如果你在编辑器运行涉及到节点的逻辑时释放该节点, 可能会导致"
"崩溃."

"To check if you are currently in the editor, use: ``Engine."

"On the other hand, if you want to execute code only in game, simply negate "

"Modifications in the editor are permanent. For example, in the following "
"case, when we remove the script, the node will keep its rotation. Be careful "
"to avoid making unwanted modifications."
msgstr ""
"编辑器中的修改是永久性的. 例如, 在下面的情况下, 当我们删除脚本时, 节点将保持"
"其旋转. 要注意避免做不需要的修改."

msgid ""
"Extending a ``@tool`` script does not automatically make the extending "
"script a ``@tool``. Omitting ``@tool`` from the extending script will "
"disable tool behavior from the super class. Therefore the extending script "
"should also specify the ``@tool`` annotation."

msgid "Reporting node configuration warnings"

"Godot uses a *node configuration warning* system to warn users about "
"incorrectly configured nodes. When a node isn't configured correctly, a "
"yellow warning sign appears next to the node's name in the Scene dock. When "
"you hover or click on the icon, a warning message pops up. You can use this "
"feature in your scripts to help you and your team avoid mistakes when "
"setting up scenes."

"When using node configuration warnings, when any value that should affect or "

"This ``_run()`` method is executed when you use **File > Run** or the "

"currently open script in the script editor. This keyboard shortcut is only "
"effective when currently focused on the script editor."

"To access nodes in the currently edited scene, use the :ref:`EditorScript."
