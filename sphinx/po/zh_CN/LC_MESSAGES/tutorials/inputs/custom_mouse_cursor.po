"You could display a \"software\" mouse cursor by hiding the mouse cursor and "
"moving a Sprite2D to the cursor position in a ``_process()`` method, but "
"this will add at least one frame of latency compared to an \"hardware\" "
"mouse cursor. Therefore, it's recommended to use the approach described here "
"whenever possible."
