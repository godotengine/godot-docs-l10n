"In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Godot's :ref:`InputEvent "
"<class_InputEvent>` system to capture player input. There are many different "
"types of input your game may use - keyboard, gamepad, mouse, etc. - and many "
"different ways to turn those inputs into actions in your game. This document "
"will show you some of the most common scenarios, which you can use as "
"starting points for your own projects."
msgstr ""
"在本教程中, 你将学习如何使用Godot的 :ref:`输入事件 <class_InputEvent>` 系统捕"

msgid "Events versus polling"
msgstr "事件和轮询"

msgid ""
"Sometimes you want your game to respond to a certain input event - pressing "
"the \"jump\" button, for example. For other situations, you might want "
"something to happen as long as a key is pressed, such as movement. In the "
"first case, you can use the ``_input()`` function, which will be called "
"whenever an input event occurs. In the second case, Godot provides the :ref:"
"`Input <class_Input>` singleton, which you can use to query the state of an "
"input."
msgstr ""
"有时你想让你的游戏对某一输入事件作出反应--例如按下 \"跳跃\" 按钮. 在其他情况"
"下, 你可能希望只要有一个键被按下就会发生一些事情, 比如移动. 在第一种情况下, "
"你可以使用 ``_input()`` 函数, 只要有输入事件发生就会调用该函数. 在第二种情况"
"下,Godot提供了 :ref:`Input <class_Input>` 单例, 你可以用它来查询一个输入的状"
"态."

"Input events are objects that inherit from :ref:`InputEvent "

"As you can see, the results are very different for the different types of "

"consider :ref:`InputEventMouseButton <class_InputEventMouseButton>`. It "
"inherits from the following classes:"
msgstr ""
"如你所见, 对于不同类型的输入, 结果是非常不同的. 按键事件甚至被打印为按键符"

":ref:`InputEvent <class_InputEvent>` - the base class for all input events"
msgstr ":ref:`InputEvent <class_InputEvent>` - 所有输入事件的基类"

msgid ""
":ref:`InputEventWithModifiers <class_InputEventWithModifiers>` - adds the "

":ref:`InputEventWithModifiers <class_InputEventWithModifiers>` - 增加了检查是"

":ref:`InputEventMouse <class_InputEventMouse>` - adds mouse event "

":ref:`InputEventMouse <class_InputEventMouse>` - 增加鼠标事件属性, 如 "

msgstr ""
":ref:`鼠标按钮输入事件 <class_InputEventMouseButton>` 包含按下的按钮的索引, "

msgid ""
"It's a good idea to keep the class reference open while you're working with "

msgstr ""
"在处理事件时, 打开类引用是一个好主意, 这样可以检查事件类型的可用属性和方法."

"The :ref:`InputMap <class_InputMap>` is the most flexible way to handle a "
