"In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Godot's :ref:`InputEvent "
"<class_InputEvent>` system to capture player input. There are many different "
"types of input your game may use - keyboard, gamepad, mouse, etc. - and many "
"different ways to turn those inputs into actions in your game. This document "
"will show you some of the most common scenarios, which you can use as "
"starting points for your own projects."
msgstr ""
"在本教程中, 您将学习如何使用Godot的 :ref:`输入事件 <class_InputEvent>` 系统捕"
"获玩家输入. 您的游戏可以使用多种不同类型的输入——键盘, 游戏手柄, 鼠标等等. 还"
"有许多不同的方法, 将这些输入转化为游戏中的动作. 本文将向您展示一些最常见的场"
"景, 您可以将其作为您自己项目的起点."

msgid "Events versus polling"
msgstr "事件和轮询"

msgid ""
"Sometimes you want your game to respond to a certain input event - pressing "
"the \"jump\" button, for example. For other situations, you might want "
"something to happen as long as a key is pressed, such as movement. In the "
"first case, you can use the ``_input()`` function, which will be called "
"whenever an input event occurs. In the second case, Godot provides the :ref:"
"`Input <class_Input>` singleton, which you can use to query the state of an "
"input."
msgstr ""
"有时你想让你的游戏对某一输入事件作出反应--例如按下 \"跳跃\" 按钮. 在其他情况"
"下, 你可能希望只要有一个键被按下就会发生一些事情, 比如移动. 在第一种情况下, "
"你可以使用 ``_input()`` 函数, 只要有输入事件发生就会调用该函数. 在第二种情况"
"下,Godot提供了 :ref:`Input <class_Input>` 单例, 你可以用它来查询一个输入的状"
"态."

"This gives you the flexibility to mix-and-match the type of input processing "
"you do."
msgstr "这使您能够灵活地混合和匹配所执行输入的处理类型."

msgid ""
"For the remainder of this tutorial, we'll focus on capturing individual "
"events in ``_input()``."
msgstr "对于本教程的其余部分, 我们将专注于使用 ``_input ()`` 捕捉单个事件."

msgid "Input events"
msgstr "输入事件"

msgid ""
"Input events are objects that inherit from :ref:`InputEvent "
"<class_InputEvent>`. Depending on the event type, the object will contain "
"specific properties related to that event. To see what events actually look "
"like, add a Node and attach the following script:"
msgstr ""
"输入事件是继承自 :ref:`输入事件 <class_InputEvent>` 的对象. 根据事件类型, 对"
"象将包含与该事件相关的特定属性. 为了了解事件的实际情况, 添加一个节点并附加以"

msgid ""
"As you press keys, move the mouse, and perform other inputs, you'll see each "
"event scroll by in the output window. Here's an example of the output:"
msgstr ""
"当你按下按键, 移动鼠标, 并执行其他输入, 您会在输出窗口中看到每个事件滚动. 下"
"面是输出的一个例子:"

msgid ""
"As you can see, the results are very different for the different types of "
"input. Key events are even printed as their key symbols. For example, let's "
"consider :ref:`InputEventMouseButton <class_InputEventMouseButton>`. It "
"inherits from the following classes:"
msgstr ""
"如你所见, 对于不同类型的输入, 结果是非常不同的. 按键事件甚至被打印为按键符"
"号. 例如, 让我们考虑 :ref:`鼠标按钮输入事件 <class_InputEventMouseButton>` . "
"它继承自以下类:"

msgid ""
":ref:`InputEvent <class_InputEvent>` - the base class for all input events"
msgstr ":ref:`InputEvent <class_InputEvent>` - 所有输入事件的基类"

msgid ""
":ref:`InputEventWithModifiers <class_InputEventWithModifiers>` - adds the "
"ability to check if modifiers are pressed, such as :kbd:`Shift` or :kbd:"
"`Alt`."
msgstr ""
":ref:`InputEventWithModifiers <class_InputEventWithModifiers>` - 增加了检查是"
"否按下修饰按键, 如 :kbd:`Shift` 或 :kbd:`Alt` ."

msgid ""
":ref:`InputEventMouse <class_InputEventMouse>` - adds mouse event "
"properties, such as ``position``"
msgstr ""
":ref:`InputEventMouse <class_InputEventMouse>` - 增加鼠标事件属性, 如 "
"``position``"

msgid ""
":ref:`InputEventMouseButton <class_InputEventMouseButton>` - contains the "
"index of the button that was pressed, whether it was a double-click, etc."
msgstr ""
":ref:`鼠标按钮输入事件 <class_InputEventMouseButton>` 包含按下的按钮的索引, "
"无论是双击, 或是其他."

msgid ""
"It's a good idea to keep the class reference open while you're working with "
"events so you can check the event type's available properties and methods."
msgstr ""
"在处理事件时, 打开类引用是一个好主意, 这样可以检查事件类型的可用属性和方法."

msgid ""
"You can encounter errors if you try to access a property on an input type "
"that doesn't contain it - calling ``position`` on ``InputEventKey`` for "
"example. To avoid this, make sure to test the event type first:"
msgstr ""
"如果您尝试访问不包含属性的输入类型上的属性, 则可能会遇到错误-例如, 对 "
"``InputEventKey`` 调用 ``Position`` . 要避免这种情况, 请确保首先测试事件类型:"

msgid "InputMap"
msgstr "InputMap"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`InputMap <class_InputMap>` is the most flexible way to handle a "
"variety of inputs. You use this by creating named input *actions*, to which "
"you can assign any number of input events, such as keypresses or mouse "
"clicks. A new Godot project includes a number of default actions already "
"defined. To see them, and to add your own, open Project -> Project Settings "
"and select the InputMap tab:"
msgstr ""
":ref:`事件表 <class_InputMap>` 是处理各种输入的最灵活的方法. 您可以通过创建命"
"名的输入 *动作* 来使用它, 可以为它分配任意数量的输入事件, 例如按键或鼠标点"
"击. 一个新的Godot项目已经包含许多默认定义操作. 看看它们, 然后添加你自己的, 打"
"开项目->项目设置, 并选择事件表选项卡:"

msgid "Capturing actions"
msgstr "捕捉动作"

msgid ""
"Once you've defined your actions, you can process them in your scripts using "
"``is_action_pressed()`` and ``is_action_released()`` by passing the name of "
"the action you're looking for:"
msgstr ""
"一旦你定义了动作, 可以在脚本中使用 ``is_action_pressed()`` 和 "
"``is_action_released ()`` 处理它们. 通过名称查找响应的动作:"

msgid "Keyboard events"
msgstr "键盘事件"

msgid ""
"Keyboard events are captured in :ref:`InputEventKey <class_InputEventKey>`. "
"While it's recommended to use input actions instead, there may be cases "
"where you want to specifically look at key events. For this example, let's "
"check for the :kbd:`T`:"
msgstr ""
"键盘事件在 :ref:`InputEventKey <class_InputEventKey>` 中被捕获. 虽然建议使用"
"输入动作来代替, 但在某些情况下, 你可能会想专门查看按键事件. 对于当前示例, 来"
"检查一下 :kbd:`T` :"

msgid ""
"Due to *keyboard ghosting*, not all key inputs may be registered at a given "
"time if you press too many keys at once. Due to their location on the "
"keyboard, certain keys are more prone to ghosting than others. Some "
"keyboards feature antighosting at a hardware level, but this feature is "
"generally not present on low-end keyboards and laptop keyboards."
msgstr ""
"由于\\ *键盘冲突*\\ ，如果你一次性按下了太多的键，那么在特定时间点，可能是无"
"法将所有按键输入都进行注册的。根据按键在键盘上位置的不同，某些按键产生冲突的"
"可能性会比其他的要高。有些键盘在硬件层面会提供抗冲突功能，不过在低端键盘和笔"
"记本键盘上很少见。"

msgid ""
"As a result, it's recommended to use a default keyboard layout that is "
"designed to work well on a keyboard without antighosting. See `this Gamedev "
"Stack Exchange question <https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/109002>`__ for "
"more information."
msgstr ""
"因此，建议使用能够在不具备抗冲突功能的键盘上也能正常工作的默认键盘布局。详情"

msgid "Keyboard modifiers"
msgstr "键盘修饰键"

msgid ""
"Modifier properties are inherited from :ref:`InputEventWithModifiers "
"<class_InputEventWithModifiers>`. This allows you to check for modifier "
"combinations using boolean properties. Let's imagine you want one thing to "
"happen when the :kbd:`T` is pressed, but something different when it's :kbd:"
"`Shift + T`:"
msgstr ""
"修饰键属性继承自 :ref:`InputEventWithModifiers "
"<class_InputEventWithModifiers>` ，可使用布尔属性检查修饰键的组合。试想，如果"
"需要在按下 :kbd:`T` 时发生一件事，而按下 :kbd:`Shift + T` 时发生不同的事："

msgid "Mouse events"
msgstr "鼠标事件"

msgid ""
"Mouse events stem from the :ref:`InputEventMouse <class_InputEventMouse>` "
"class, and are separated into two types: :ref:`InputEventMouseButton "
"<class_InputEventMouseButton>` and :ref:`InputEventMouseMotion "
"<class_InputEventMouseMotion>`. Note that this means that all mouse events "
"will contain a ``position`` property."
msgstr ""
"鼠标事件继承自 :ref:`InputEventMouse <class_InputEventMouse>` 并被分成 :ref:"
"`InputEventMouseButton <class_InputEventMouseButton>` 和 :ref:"
"`InputEventMouseMotion <class_InputEventMouseMotion>` 两种类型。注意，这意味"
"着所有鼠标事件都包含 ``position`` 属性。"

msgid "Mouse buttons"
msgstr "鼠标按钮"

msgid ""
"Capturing mouse buttons is very similar to handling key events. :ref:"
"`@GlobalScope_ButtonList <enum_@GlobalScope_ButtonList>` contains a list of "
"``BUTTON_*`` constants for each possible button, which will be reported in "
"the event's ``button_index`` property. Note that the scrollwheel also counts "
"as a button - two buttons, to be precise, with both ``BUTTON_WHEEL_UP`` and "
"``BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN`` being separate events."
msgstr ""
"捕获鼠标按钮与处理按键事件非常相似。\\ :ref:`@GlobalScope_ButtonList "
"<enum_@GlobalScope_ButtonList>` 包含每个可能按钮的 `BUTTON_*` 常量列表，它将"
"在事件的 ``button_index`` 属性中报告。注意，鼠标滚轮也可以算作一个按钮——准确"
"地说是两个按钮，\\ ``BUTTON_WHEEL_UP``\\ （滚轮键向上）和 "
"``BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN``\\ （滚轮键向上）都是独立的事件。"

msgid "Mouse motion"
msgstr "鼠标行为"

msgid ""
":ref:`InputEventMouseMotion <class_InputEventMouseMotion>` events occur "

msgstr "下面是一个使用鼠标事件拖放 :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` 节点的例子："

msgid "Touch events"
msgstr "触摸事件"

msgid ""
"If you are using a touchscreen device, you can generate touch events. :ref:"
"`InputEventScreenTouch <class_InputEventScreenTouch>` is equivalent to a "

"<class_InputEventScreenDrag>` works much the same as mouse motion."
msgstr ""
"如果你使用的是触摸屏设备，就可以生成触摸事件。\\ :ref:`InputEventScreenTouch "

msgid ""
"To test your touch events on a non-touchscreen device, open Project Settings "
"and go to the \"Input Devices/Pointing\" section. Enable \"Emulate Touch "
"From Mouse\" and your project will interpret mouse clicks and motion as "
"touch events."
msgstr ""
"要在非触摸屏设备上测试触摸事件，请打开“项目设置”，进入“Input Devices/"
