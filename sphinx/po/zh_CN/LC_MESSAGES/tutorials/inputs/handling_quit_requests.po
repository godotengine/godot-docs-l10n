"Most platforms have the option to request the application to quit. On "

"go back otherwise)."
msgstr ""
"大多数平台都有要求应用程序退出的选项。在桌面系统中，这通常是通过窗口标题栏上"

"devices don't have a physical Back button."

"While forcing the application to close can be done by calling :ref:"
"`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>`, doing so will not send the "
"quit *notification*. This means the function described above won't be "
"called. Quitting by calling :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` will not allow custom actions to complete "
"(such as saving, confirming the quit, or debugging), even if you try to "
"delay the line that forces the quit."
msgstr ""
"虽然强迫应用程序关闭可以通过调用 :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 来完成，但这样做不会发送退出的\\ *通知*\\ 。这"
"意味着上面描述的函数不会被调用。通过调用 :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 来退出，将不允许自定义动作的完成（比如保存、确"
"认退出或调试），即使你试图延迟强制退出的行。"

msgid "Instead, you should send a quit request:"
