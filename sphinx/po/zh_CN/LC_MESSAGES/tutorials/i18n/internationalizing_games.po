msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

"Sería excelente que el mundo hablara solo un idioma (It would be great if "
"the world spoke only one language). Unfortunately for us developers, that is "
"not the case. While indie or niche games usually do not need localization, "
"games targeting a more massive market often require localization. Godot "
"offers many tools to make this process more straightforward, so this "
"tutorial is more like a collection of tips and tricks."
msgstr ""
"Sería excelente que el mundo hablara solo un idioma（如果全世界都讲同一种语言"
"就太好了）。不幸的是对于我们的开发人员来说，情况并非如此。虽然独立或投机游戏"
"通常不需要本地化，但瞄准更大市场的游戏通常需要本地化。Godot 提供了许多工具来"
"使这个过程更加简单，因此本教程更像一个妙招和技巧的合集。"

msgid ""
"Localization is usually done by specific studios hired for the job and, "
"despite the huge amount of software and file formats available for this, the "
"most common way to do localization to this day is still with spreadsheets. "
"The process of creating the spreadsheets and importing them is already "
"covered in the :ref:`doc_importing_translations` tutorial, so this one could "
"be seen more like a follow-up to that one."
msgstr ""
"本地化通常是通过雇佣特定的工作室来完成的，尽管有大量的软件和文件格式可供使"
"用，但迄今为止进行本地化最常见的方式仍然是使用电子表格。创建电子表格并导入电"
"子表格的过程已经在 :ref:`doc_importing_translations` 教程中介绍过了，所以这个"
"教程更像是对那个教程的后续。"

msgid ""
"We will be using the official demo as an example; you can `download it from "
"the Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/134>`_."

msgid "Configuring the imported translation"
msgstr "配置导入的译文"

msgid ""
"Translations can get updated and re-imported when they change, but they "
"still have to be added to the project. This is done in **Project → Project "
"Settings → Localization**:"
msgstr ""
"翻译可以在更改时得到更新和重新导入，但仍必须添加到项目中。可通过\\ **项目 → "
"项目设置 → 本地化**\\ 来完成："

msgid "The above dialog is used to add or remove translations project-wide."
msgstr "上述对话框用于添加或删除项目范围内的翻译。"

msgid "Localizing resources"
msgstr "资源的本地化"

msgid ""
"It is also possible to instruct Godot to use alternate versions of assets "
"(resources) depending on the current language. The **Remaps** tab can be "
"used for this:"
msgstr ""
"根据当前语言，还可以指示 Godot 使用替代版本的素材（资源）。\\ **重定向**\\ 选"
"项卡可用于此："

msgid ""
"Select the resource to be remapped, then add some alternatives for each "
"locale."
msgstr "选择需要重定向的资源，并指定它在其他语言地区的替代方案。"

msgid "Converting keys to text"
msgstr "将键转换为文本"

msgid ""
"Some controls, such as :ref:`Button <class_Button>` and :ref:`Label "
"<class_Label>`, will automatically fetch a translation if their text matches "
"a translation key. For example, if a label's text is "
"\"MAIN_SCREEN_GREETING1\" and that key exists in the current translation, "
"then the text will automatically be translated."
msgstr ""
"一些控件，例如 :ref:`Button <class_Button>` 和 :ref:`Label "
"<class_Label>`\\ ，如果它们的文本与一个翻译键值相匹配，将自动获取翻译内容。例"
"如，如果一个标签的文本是“MAIN_SCREEN_GREETING1”并且该键值存在于当前的翻译中，"
"那么该文本将被自动翻译。"

msgid ""
"This automatic translation behavior may be undesirable in certain cases. For "
"instance, when using a Label to display a player's name, you most likely "
"don't want the player's name to be translated if it matches a translation "
"key. To disable automatic translation on a specific node, use :ref:`Object."
"set_message_translation<class_Object_method_set_message_translation>` and "
"send a :ref:`Object.notification<class_Object_method_notification>` to "
"update the translation::"
msgstr ""
"这种自动翻译行为在某些情况下可能是不可取的。例如，当使用 Label 来显示玩家的名"
"字时，如果玩家的名字与翻译键相匹配，你很可能不希望它被翻译。要禁用特定节点的"
"自动翻译，请使用 :ref:`Object."
"set_message_translation<class_Object_method_set_message_translation>` 并发"
"送 :ref:`Object.notification<class_Object_method_notification>` 来更新翻"
"译： ::"

msgid ""
"For more complex UI nodes such as OptionButtons, you may have to use this "
"instead::"
msgstr "对于 OptionButton 等更复杂的 UI 节点，你可能要用这个代替： ::"

msgid ""
"In code, the :ref:`Object.tr() <class_Object_method_tr>` function can be "
"used. This will just look up the text in the translations and convert it if "
"found:"
msgstr ""
"在代码中, 可以使用 :ref:`Object.tr() <class_Object_method_tr>` 函数. 这将只是"
"在翻译中查找文本, 如果找到的话就进行转换:"

msgid "Making controls resizable"
msgstr "使控件的大小可调"

msgid ""
"The same text in different languages can vary greatly in length. For this, "
"make sure to read the tutorial on :ref:`doc_size_and_anchors`, as "
"dynamically adjusting control sizes may help. :ref:`Container "
"<class_Container>` can be useful, as well as the text wrapping options "
"available in :ref:`Label <class_Label>`."
msgstr ""
"不同语言的相同文本的长度差异很大。为此，请务必阅读教程 :ref:"
"`doc_size_and_anchors`\\ ，因为动态调整控件大小可能有所帮助。\\ :ref:"
"`Container <class_Container>` 可能很有用，\\ :ref:`Label <class_Label>` 的文"
"本换行选项应该也能帮上忙。"

msgid ""
"Godot has a server handling low-level translation management called the :ref:"
"`TranslationServer <class_TranslationServer>`. Translations can be added or "
"removed during run-time; the current language can also be changed at run-"
"time."

"Godot 有一个进行底层翻译管理的服务器，名为 :ref:`TranslationServer "

"You may want to test a project's translation before releasing it. Godot "
"provides two ways to do this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, in the Project Settings, under **Input Devices > Locale**, there is a "
"**Test** property. Set this property to the locale code of the language you "
"want to test. Godot will run the project with that locale when the project "
"is run (either from the editor or when exported)."

"Keep in mind that since this is a project setting, it will show up in "

"set back to an empty value before committing changes to version control."

"Settings** and append the locale identifier to it. For instance, for "
"Spanish, this would be ``application/name_es``:"

"导出到不同的操作系统和平台时，项目名称将成为应用程序名称。要以多种语言指定项"
