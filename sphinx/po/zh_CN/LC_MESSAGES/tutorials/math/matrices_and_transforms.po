msgid "Matrices and transforms"
msgstr "矩阵与变换"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"Before reading this tutorial, we recommend that you thoroughly read and "
"understand the :ref:`doc_vector_math` tutorial, as this tutorial requires a "
"knowledge of vectors."
msgstr ""
"在阅读本教程之前，我们推荐你从头到尾阅读并且理解 :ref:`doc_vector_math` 教"
"程，因为本教程需要一点向量的知识。"

msgid ""
"This tutorial is about *transformations* and how we represent them in Godot "
"using matrices. It is not a full in-depth guide to matrices. Transformations "
"are most of the time applied as translation, rotation, and scale, so we will "
"focus on how to represent those with matrices."
msgstr ""
"这个教程介绍的是\\ *变换*\\ 以及我们如何在 Godot 中使用矩阵表示它。这不是完整"
"深入的矩阵指南。变换大多数时候被应用为平移、旋转、缩放，所以我们将会关注如何"
"用矩阵表示这些变换。"

msgid ""
"Most of this guide focuses on 2D, using :ref:`class_Transform2D` and :ref:"
"`class_Vector2`, but the way things work in 3D is very similar."
msgstr ""
"虽然这个指南主要关注于 2D，使用 :ref:`class_Transform2D` 和 :ref:"
"`class_Vector2`\\ ，但是 3D 中的工作方式也十分相似。"

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the previous tutorial, it is important to remember that in "
"Godot, the Y axis points *down* in 2D. This is the opposite of how most "
"schools teach linear algebra, with the Y axis pointing up."
msgstr ""
"正如之前的教程中提到的，要记住在 Godot 中，2D 的 Y 轴是\\ *向下*\\ 的。这与学"
"校里教的线性代数正好相反，在那里 Y 轴是向上的。"

msgid ""
"The convention is that the X axis is red, the Y axis is green, and the Z "
"axis is blue. This tutorial is color-coded to match these conventions, but "
"we will also represent the origin vector with a blue color."
msgstr ""
"这里的惯例是 X 轴用红色、Y 轴用绿色、Z 轴用蓝色。本教程中的颜色都遵循这个惯"
"例，不过我们也在原点向量上使用蓝色。"

msgid "Matrix components and the Identity matrix"
msgstr "矩阵分量和单位矩阵"

msgid ""
"The identity matrix represents a transform with no translation, no rotation, "
"and no scale. Let's start by looking at the identity matrix and how its "
"components relate to how it visually appears."
msgstr ""
"单位矩阵代表一个没有平移、没有旋转、没有缩放的变换。让我们开始看看单位矩阵以"
"及它的分量如何与它的视觉表现相联系吧。"

msgid ""
"Matrices have rows and columns, and a transformation matrix has specific "
"conventions on what each does."
msgstr "矩阵有行和列，变换矩阵对它们有特定的约定。"

msgid ""
"In the image above, we can see that the red X vector is represented by the "
"first column of the matrix, and the green Y vector is likewise represented "
"by the second column. A change to the columns will change these vectors. We "
"will see how they can be manipulated in the next few examples."
msgstr ""
"在上图中，我们可以看到红色的 X 向量由矩阵的第一列表示，绿色的 Y 向量则由第二"
"列表示。改变列就会改变这些向量。我们将在接下来的几个例子中看到如何操作它们。"

msgid ""
"You should not worry about manipulating rows directly, as we usually work "
"with columns. However, you can think of the rows of the matrix as showing "
"which vectors contribute to moving in a given direction."
msgstr ""
"您不必担心直接操作行, 因为我们通常使用列. 然而, 你可以把矩阵的行看作是表示哪"
"些向量有助于在给定的方向上移动."

msgid ""
"When we refer to a value such as `t.x.y`, that's the Y component of the X "
"column vector. In other words, the bottom-left of the matrix. Similarly, `t."
"x.x` is top-left, `t.y.x` is top-right, and `t.y.y` is bottom-right, where "
"`t` is the Transform2D."
msgstr ""
"当我们指定一个值例如 `t.x.y` , 这是X列向量的Y分量. 换句话说, 是这个矩阵的左下"
"角. 类似地, `t.x.x` 是左上角, `t.y.x` 是右上角, 然后 `t.y.y` 是右下角, 在这"
"里 `t` 是一个 Transform2D."

msgid "Scaling the transformation matrix"
msgstr "缩放变换矩阵"

msgid ""
"Applying a scale is one of the easiest operations to understand. Let's start "
"by placing the Godot logo underneath our vectors so that we can visually see "
"the effects on an object:"
msgstr ""
"应用一个缩放是最容易理解的操作之一. 让我们开始吧, 把Godot logo放置于我们的向"
"量之下, 这样我们可以直观得看出应用于这些对象上的效果:"

msgid ""
"Now, to scale the matrix, all we need to do is multiply each component by "
"the scale we want. Let's scale it up by 2. 1 times 2 becomes 2, and 0 times "
"2 becomes 0, so we end up with this:"
msgstr ""
"现在, 为了缩放矩阵, 我们唯一需要做的就是将每个矩阵分量乘以我们想要的缩放比"
"例. 来将它缩放两倍吧,1乘以2变成了2,0乘以2变成了0, 所以我们最后得到了这个:"

msgid "To do this in code, we can simply multiply each of the vectors:"
msgstr "要在代码中做到这件事. 我们可以简单地乘上每个向量:"

msgid ""
"If we wanted to return it to its original scale, we can multiply each "
"component by 0.5. That's pretty much all there is to scaling a "
"transformation matrix."
msgstr ""
"如果我们想要回到它原来的尺度, 我们可以对每个分量乘以0.5. 这几乎就是缩放一个变"
"换矩阵的全部了."

msgid ""
"To calculate the object's scale from an existing transformation matrix, you "
"can use `length()` on each of the column vectors."
msgstr ""
"要从一个已经存在的变换矩阵中计算对象的缩放尺度, 你可以对每个列向量使用 "
"`length()` 方法."

msgid ""
"In actual projects, you can use the `scaled()` method to perform scaling."
msgstr "在实际的项目中, 你可以使用 `scaled()` 方法去执行缩放."

msgid "Rotating the transformation matrix"
msgstr "旋转变换矩阵"

msgid ""
"We'll start the same way as earlier, with the Godot logo underneath the "
"identity matrix:"
msgstr "我们将以与前面相同的方式开始, 在标识矩阵下使用Godot徽标:"

msgid ""
"As an example, let's say we want to rotate our Godot logo clockwise by 90 "
"degrees. Right now the X axis points right and the Y axis points down. If we "
"rotate these in our head, we would logically see that the new X axis should "
"point down and the new Y axis should point left."
msgstr ""
"举个例子，假设我们想顺时针旋转 Godot 标志 90 度。现在，X 轴指向右边，Y 轴向"
"下。如果我们在头脑中旋转这些，我们就会在逻辑上看到，新的 X 轴应该向下，新的 "
"Y 轴应该指向左边。"

msgid ""
"You can imagine that you grab both the Godot logo and its vectors, and then "
"spin it around the center. Wherever you finish spinning, the orientation of "
"the vectors determines what the matrix is."
msgstr ""
"你可以想象, 你抓住了godot的图标和它的向量, 然后旋转它的中心. 无论你在哪里完成"
"旋转, 向量的方向决定了矩阵是什么."

msgid ""
"We need to represent \"down\" and \"left\" in normal coordinates, so means "
"we'll set X to (0, 1) and Y to (-1, 0). These are also the values of "
"`Vector2.DOWN` and `Vector2.LEFT`. When we do this, we get the desired "
"result of rotating the object:"
msgstr ""
"我们需要在法线坐标中表示“下”和“左”，因此我们将 X 设为 (0, 1)，将 Y 设为 (-1, "
"0)。这些也正是 Vector2.DOWN 和 Vector2.LEFT 的值，当我们这样做时，就会得到旋"
"转对象想要的结果："

msgid ""
"If you have trouble understanding the above, try this exercise: Cut a square "
"of paper, draw X and Y vectors on top of it, place it on graph paper, then "
"rotate it and note the endpoints."
msgstr ""
"如果你很难理解上面的内容, 那就试试这个练习: 剪一个正方形的纸, 在上面画X和Y向"
"量, 把它放在图表纸上, 然后旋转它并记下端点."

msgid ""
"To perform rotation in code, we need to be able to calculate the values "
"programmatically. This image shows the formulas needed to calculate the "
"transformation matrix from a rotation angle. Don't worry if this part seems "
"complicated, I promise it's the hardest thing you need to know."
msgstr ""
"要在代码中执行旋转, 我们需要能够以编程方式计算值. 这幅图像显示了从旋转角度计"
"算变换矩阵所需的公式. 如果这部分看起来很复杂, 别担心, 我保证这是你需要知道的"
"最难的事情."

msgid ""
"Godot represents all rotations with radians, not degrees. A full turn is "
"`TAU` or `PI*2` radians, and a quarter turn of 90 degrees is `TAU/4` or "
"`PI/2` radians. Working with `TAU` usually results in more readable code."
msgstr ""
"Godot 用弧度表示所有的旋转，不用角度。完整转一圈是 `TAU` 或 `PI*2` 弧度，90 "
"度的四分之一圈是 `TAU/4` 或 `PI/2` 弧度。使用 `TAU` 通常会让代码更易读。"

msgid ""
"Fun fact: In addition to Y being *down* in Godot, rotation is represented "
"clockwise. This means that all the math and trig functions behave the same "
"as a Y-is-up CCW system, since these differences \"cancel out\". You can "
"think of rotations in both systems being \"from X to Y\"."
msgstr ""
"有趣的事实：在 Godot 中，不仅 Y 是\\ *朝下*\\ 的，旋转也是顺时针的。这意味着"
"所有的数学和三角函数的行为都与 Y 朝上的 CCW 坐标系相同，因为这些差异“相互抵"
"消”了。你可以认为在这两个坐标系中的旋转都是“从 X 到 Y”。"

msgid ""
"In order to perform a rotation of 0.5 radians (about 28.65 degrees), we "
"simply plug in a value of 0.5 to the formula above and evaluate to find what "
"the actual values should be:"
msgstr ""
"为了执行 0.5 弧度的旋转（约 28.65 度），我们只需将 0.5 代入上面的公式中，然后"
"计算出实际值应该是什么："

msgid "Here's how that would be done in code (place the script on a Node2D):"
msgstr "这是在代码中完成的方法（将脚本放在 Node2D 上）："

msgid ""
"To calculate the object's rotation from an existing transformation matrix, "
"you can use `atan2(t.x.y, t.x.x)`, where t is the Transform2D."
msgstr ""
"要从现有的变换矩阵中计算对象的旋转，可以使用 `atan2(t.x.y, t.x.x)`\\ ，其中 "
"t 是 Transform2D。"

msgid ""
"In actual projects, you can use the `rotated()` method to perform rotations."
msgstr "在实际项目中，可以使用 `rotated()` 方法进行旋转。"

msgid "Basis of the transformation matrix"
msgstr "变换矩阵的基"

msgid ""
"So far we have only been working with the `x` and `y`, vectors, which are in "
"charge of representing rotation, scale, and/or shearing (advanced, covered "
"at the end). The X and Y vectors are together called the *basis* of the "
"transformation matrix. The terms \"basis\" and \"basis vectors\" are "
"important to know."
msgstr ""
"到目前为止，我们只使用 `x` 和 `y` 向量，它们负责表示旋转、缩放和/或剪切（高"
"级，会在文末提及）。X 和 Y 向量合称变换矩阵的\\ *基*\\ （Basis）。“基”和“基向"
"量”都是非常重要的术语。"

msgid ""
"You might have noticed that :ref:`class_Transform2D` actually has three :ref:"
"`class_Vector2` values: `x`, `y`, and `origin`. The `origin` value is not "
"part of the basis, but it is part of the transform, and we need it to "
"represent position. From now on we'll keep track of the origin vector in all "
"examples. You can think of origin as another column, but it's often better "
"to think of it as completely separate."
msgstr ""
"你可能已经注意到 :ref:`class_Transform2D` 实际上有三个 :ref:`class_Vector2` "
"值：\\ `x`\\ 、\\ `y`\\ 、\\ `origin`\\ 。其中 `origin` 值不是基的一部分，而"
"是变换的一部分，我们需要用它来表示位置。从现在开始，我们将在所有例子中记录原"
"点向量。您可以将原点看作另一列，但把它认为是完全独立的通常更好。"

msgid ""
"Note that in 3D, Godot has a separate :ref:`class_Basis` structure for "
"holding the three :ref:`class_Vector3` values of the basis, since the code "
"can get complex and it makes sense to separate it from :ref:"
"`class_Transform` (which is composed of one :ref:`class_Basis` and one "
"extra :ref:`class_Vector3` for the origin)."
msgstr ""
"请注意在 3D 中，Godot 有一个单独的 :ref:`class_Basis` 结构，里面包含矩阵基的"
"三个 :ref:`class_Vector3` 的值。因为代码可能变得复杂，因此将它们从 :ref:"
"`class_Transform`\\ （由一个 :ref:`class_Basis` 和一个额外的原点 :ref:"
"`class_Vector3` 组成）中拆分出来是值得的。"

msgid "Translating the transformation matrix"
msgstr "变换矩阵的平移"

msgid ""
"Changing the `origin` vector is called a *translating* the transformation "
"matrix. Translating is basically a technical term for \"moving\" the object, "
"but it explicitly does not involve any rotation."
msgstr ""
"对 `origin` 向量的修改称为对变换矩阵的\\ *平移*\\ 。平移其实上是“移动”对象的"
"一个技术术语，但它不会包含任何旋转。"

msgid ""
"Let's work through an example to help understand this. We will start with "
"the identity transform like last time, except we will keep track of the "
"origin vector this time."
msgstr ""
"让我们通过一个例子来帮助理解这一点。我们将像上次一样从恒等变换开始，但这次我"
"们将记录原点向量。"

msgid ""
"If we want the object to move to a position of (1, 2), we simply need to set "
"its `origin` vector to (1, 2):"
msgstr ""
"如果希望对象移动到 (1, 2) 的位置，只需将其 `origin` 向量设置为 (1, 2)："

msgid ""
"There is also a `translated()` method, which performs a different operation "
"to adding or changing `origin` directly. The `translated()` method will "
"translate the object *relative to its own rotation*. For example, an object "
"rotated 90 degrees clockwise will move to the right when `translated()` with "
"`Vector2.UP`."
msgstr ""
"还有一个 `translated()` 方法，它执行的是与直接增加或更改 `origin` 不同的操"
"作。这个 `translated()` 方法将让该对象相对于它自己的旋转进行平移。例如，顺时"
"针旋转了 90 度的对象如果用 `Vector2.UP` 调用了 `translated()`\\ ，那么它就会"
"向右移动。"

msgid ""
"Godot's 2D uses coordinates based on pixels, so in actual projects you will "
"want to translate by hundreds of units."
msgstr ""
"Godot 的 2D 使用基于像素的坐标，所以在实际项目中，你会想要转换成数百个单位。"

msgid "Putting it all together"
msgstr "融会贯通"

msgid ""
"We're going to apply everything we mentioned so far onto one transform. To "
"follow along, create a simple project with a Sprite node and use the Godot "
"logo for the texture resource."
msgstr ""
"我们将把到目前为止提到的所有内容都应用到一个变换上。接下来，使用 Sprite 节点"
"创建一个简单的项目，并使用 Godot 徽标作为其纹理资源。"

msgid ""
"Let's set the translation to (350, 150), rotate by -0.5 rad, and scale by 3. "
"I've posted a screenshot, and the code to reproduce it, but I encourage you "
"to try and reproduce the screenshot without looking at the code!"
msgstr ""
"让我们将平移设置为 (350, 150)，旋转设为 -0.5 rad，缩放设为 3。我把屏幕截图和"
"重现代码都发出来了，但我鼓励您不看代码来尝试重现屏幕截图！"

msgid "Shearing the transformation matrix (advanced)"
msgstr "剪切变换矩阵（高级）"

msgid ""
"If you are only looking for how to *use* transformation matrices, feel free "
"to skip this section of the tutorial. This section explores an uncommonly "

"understanding of them."
msgstr ""
"如果您只想了解如何\\ *使用*\\ 变换矩阵，请随意跳过本教程的这一节。本节探讨变"
"换矩阵的一个不常用的方面，目的是为了你建立对它们的理解。"

msgid ""
"You may have noticed that a transform has more degrees of freedom than the "
"combination of the above actions. The basis of a 2D transformation matrix "
"has four total numbers in two :ref:`class_Vector2` values, while a rotation "
"value and a Vector2 for scale only has 3 numbers. The high-level concept for "
"the missing degree of freedom is called *shearing*."
msgstr ""
"您可能已经注意到，变换的自由度比上述操作的组合要多。2D 变换矩阵的基在两个 :"
"ref:`class_Vector2` 值中总共有四个数，而旋转值和缩放的 Vector2 只有三个数字。"
"缺失自由度的高级概念称为\\ *剪切*\\ （Shearing）。"

msgid ""
"Normally, you will always have the basis vectors perpendicular to each "
"other. However, shearing can be useful in some situations, and understanding "
"shearing helps you understand how transforms work."
msgstr ""
"通常，您将始终拥有彼此垂直的基向量。但是，剪切在某些情况下可能很有用，了解剪"
"切可以帮助您理解变换的工作原理。"

msgid ""
"To show you visually how it will look, let's overlay a grid onto the Godot "
"logo:"
msgstr "为了直观地向您展示它的外观, 让我们在Godot徽标上叠加一个网格:"

msgid ""
"Each point on this grid is obtained by adding the basis vectors together. "
"The bottom-right corner is X + Y, while the top-right corner is X - Y. If we "
"change the basis vectors, the entire grid moves with it, as the grid is "
"composed of the basis vectors. All lines on the grid that are currently "
"parallel will remain parallel no matter what changes we make to the basis "
"vectors."
msgstr ""
"此网格上的每个点都是通过将基向量相加而获得的。右下角是 X + Y，而右上角是 X - "
"Y。如果我们更改基向量，整个栅格也会随之移动，因为栅格是由基向量组成的。无论我"
"们对基向量做什么更改，栅格上当前平行的所有直线都将保持平行。"

msgid "As an example, let's set Y to (1, 1):"
msgstr "例如, 让我们将Y设置为(1,1):"

msgid ""
"You can't set the raw values of a Transform2D in the editor, so you *must* "

msgstr "不能在编辑器中设置Transform2D的原始值, 所以想要剪切对象, 必须使用代码."

msgid ""
"Due to the vectors no longer being perpendicular, the object has been "

msgid ""
"The intra-object coordinates are called UV coordinates in textures, so let's "
