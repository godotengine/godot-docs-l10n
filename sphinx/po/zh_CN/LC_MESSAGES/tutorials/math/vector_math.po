"This tutorial is a short and practical introduction to linear algebra as it "
"applies to game development. Linear algebra is the study of vectors and "
"their uses. Vectors have many applications in both 2D and 3D development and "
"Godot uses them extensively. Developing a good understanding of vector math "
"is essential to becoming a strong game developer."

"If you're new to computer graphics, it might seem odd that the positive "

msgstr ""
"如果你是计算机图形学的新手，可能会觉得很奇怪，\\ ``y`` 轴的正方向\\ **朝下"

"Any position in the 2D plane can be identified by a pair of numbers in this "

"You can use either method (x and y coordinates or angle and magnitude) to "

"A vector can represent **any** quantity with a magnitude and direction. "
"Typical examples are: position, velocity, acceleration, and force. In this "
"image, the spaceship at step 1 has a position vector of ``(1, 3)`` and a "
"velocity vector of ``(2, 1)``. The velocity vector represents how far the "
"ship moves each step. We can find the position for step 2 by adding the "

"度、力。在这幅图像中，在第 1 步的飞船的位置向量为 ``(1,3)``\\ ，速度向量为 "
"``(2,1)``\\ 。速度向量表示船舶每一步移动的距离。通过将速度加到当前位置，我们"

"Velocity measures the **change** in position per unit of time. The new "

"In a typical 2D game scenario, you would have a velocity in pixels per "

"In this scenario, you have a tank that wishes to point its turret at a "

msgid "Unit vectors"
msgstr "单位向量"

msgid ""
"A vector with **magnitude** of ``1`` is called a **unit vector**. They are "
"also sometimes referred to as **direction vectors** or **normals**. Unit "
"vectors are helpful when you need to keep track of a direction."

"**Normalizing** a vector means reducing its length to ``1`` while preserving "

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Because normalization involves dividing by the vector's length, you cannot "
"normalize a vector of length ``0``. Attempting to do so would normally "
"result in an error. In GDScript though, trying to call the ``normalized()`` "
"method on a vector of length 0 leaves the value untouched and avoids the "
"error for you."
msgstr ""
"因为归一化需要除以向量的长度, 所以不能对长度为 ``0`` 的向量进行归一化. 试图这"
"样做会导致错误."

msgid "Reflection"

msgid ""
"A common use of unit vectors is to indicate **normals**. Normal vectors are "
"unit vectors aligned perpendicularly to a surface, defining its direction. "
"They are commonly used for lighting, collisions, and other operations "
"involving surfaces."
msgstr ""
"单位向量的一种常见用法是表示\\ **法线**\\ 。法向量是垂直于表面的单位向量，定"

msgstr "例如, 假设我们有一个移动的球, 我们想从墙上或其他物体上弹回来:"

#, fuzzy

"The surface normal has a value of ``(0, -1)`` because this is a horizontal "
"surface. When the ball collides, we take its remaining motion (the amount "
"left over when it hits the surface) and reflect it using the normal. In "
"Godot, there is a :ref:`bounce() <class_Vector2_method_bounce>` method to "
"handle this. Here is a code example of the above diagram using a :ref:"
"`CharacterBody2D <class_CharacterBody2D>`:"

"因为这是一个水平曲面，所以曲面法线的值为 ``(0, -1)`` . 当球碰撞时，我们取它的"

msgid "Dot product"

msgid ""
"The **dot product** is one of the most important concepts in vector math, "
"but is often misunderstood. Dot product is an operation on two vectors that "
"returns a **scalar**. Unlike a vector, which contains both magnitude and "
"direction, a scalar value has only magnitude."
msgstr ""
"**点积**\\ 是向量数学中最重要的概念之一，但经常被误解。点积是对两个向量的操"

"The mathematical notation *||A||* represents the magnitude of vector ``A``, "

"然而, 在大多数情况下, 使用内置方法是最容易的. 注意, 两个向量的顺序并不重要:"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The dot product is most useful when used with unit vectors, making the first "
"formula reduce to just ``cos(θ)``. This means we can use the dot product to "
"tell us something about the angle between two vectors:"
msgstr ""
"当与单位向量一起使用时，点积是最有用的，使得第一个公式减少到仅有 "
"``cosθ``\\ 。这意味着我们可以使用点积来告诉我们关于两个向量之间的角度的一些信"

"Like the dot product, the **cross product** is an operation on two vectors. "

"vector."
msgstr ""
"和点积一样，\\ **叉积**\\ 也是对两个向量的运算。但是，叉乘积的结果是一个方向"

"In the dot product section above, we saw how it could be used to find the "

msgstr ""
"在上面的点积部分，我们看到如何用它来查找两个向量之间的角度。然而在 3D 中，这"
