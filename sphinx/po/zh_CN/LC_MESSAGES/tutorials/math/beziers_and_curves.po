"To draw a curve between them, we first interpolate gradually over the two "

msgstr ""
"要在它们之间画一条曲线，我们首先使用 0 到 1 之间的值，在由这三个点构成的两个"

"Using them, however, may not be completely obvious, so following is a "
"description of the most common use cases for Bezier curves."
msgstr "然而它们的使用方法可能不是很直观，下面是对贝塞尔曲线最常见用例的描述。"

msgid "Evaluating"
msgstr "估值"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Only evaluating them may be an option, but in most cases it's not very "
"useful. The big drawback with Bezier curves is that if you traverse them at "
"constant speed, from ``t = 0`` to ``t = 1``, the actual interpolation will "
"*not* move at constant speed. The speed is also an interpolation between the "
"distances between points ``p0``, ``p1``, ``p2`` and ``p3`` and there is not "
"a mathematically simple way to traverse the curve at constant speed."
msgstr ""
"一种选择是直接估值，不过在大多数情况下都不是很有用。贝塞尔曲线最大的缺点是如"
"果你以恒定的速度沿着它走，从 ``t = 0`` 到 ``t = 1``\\ ，实际的插值\\ *不会"
"*\\ 以恒定的速度移动。速度也是根据点 ``p0``\\ 、\\ ``p1``\\ 、\\ "
"``p2``\\ 、\\ ``p3`` 之间距离插值出来的，无法使用简单的数学方法以恒定的速度通"
"过曲线。"

#, fuzzy
msgid "Let's do an example with the following pseudocode:"
msgstr "让我们用下面的伪代码举个简单的例子："

msgid ""
"As you can see, the speed (in pixels per second) of the circle varies, even "
"though ``t`` is increased at constant speed. This makes beziers difficult to "
"use for anything practical out of the box."
msgstr ""
"如你所见，即便 ``t`` 在匀速递增，圆点的速度还是在不断变化的（以像素每秒为单"
"位）。这也使贝塞尔难以做到任何实际的开箱即用。"

msgid "Drawing"
msgstr "绘制"

msgid ""
"Drawing beziers (or objects based on the curve) is a very common use case, "
"but it's also not easy. For pretty much any case, Bezier curves need to be "
"converted to some sort of segments. This is normally difficult, however, "
"without creating a very high amount of them."
msgstr ""
"绘制贝塞尔(或基于曲线的对象)是很常见的用例, 但这也不容易. 几乎在任何情况下, "
"贝塞尔曲线需要被转换成某种线段. 这通常很难, 然而, 并没有创建非常高数量的线段."

msgid ""
"The reason is that some sections of a curve (specifically, corners) may "
"require considerable amounts of points, while other sections may not:"
msgstr ""
"原因是曲线的某些部分(具体来说是角落)可能需要相当多的点, 而其他部分不一定:"

msgid ""
"Additionally, if both control points were ``0, 0`` (remember they are "
"relative vectors), the Bezier curve would just be a straight line (so "
"drawing a high amount of points would be wasteful)."
msgstr ""
"另外，如果两个控制点都是 ``0,0``\\ （请记住它们是相对向量），贝塞尔曲线就是一"
"条直线（所以画很多点就是在浪费时间）。"

msgid ""
"Before drawing Bezier curves, *tessellation* is required. This is often done "
"with a recursive or divide and conquer function that splits the curve until "
"the curvature amount becomes less than a certain threshold."
msgstr ""
"在绘制贝塞尔曲线之前, 需要进行 *细分* . 这通常是用递归函数或除法函数来完成"
"的, 它可以分割曲线, 直到曲率变得小于某个阈值."

msgid ""
"The *Curve* classes provide this via the :ref:`Curve2D.tessellate() "
"<class_Curve2D_method_tessellate>` function (which receives optional "
"``stages`` of recursion and angle ``tolerance`` arguments). This way, "
"drawing something based on a curve is easier."
msgstr ""
"*Curve* 类通过 :ref:`Curve2D.tessellate() <class_Curve2D_method_tessellate>` "
"函数来提供该功能(函数接收可选的 ``stages`` 递归和角度 ``tolerance`` 参数). 这"
"样一来, 基于曲线画东西就比较容易了."

msgid "Traversal"
msgstr "遍历"

msgid ""
"The last common use case for the curves is to traverse them. Because of what "
"was mentioned before regarding constant speed, this is also difficult."
msgstr "最后曲线最常见的用例是遍历. 因为之前提到关于匀速的内容, 这也是困难的."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"To make this easier, the curves need to be *baked* into equidistant points. "
"This way, they can be approximated with regular interpolation (which can be "
"improved further with a cubic option). To do this, just use the :ref:"
"`Curve3D.sample_baked()<class_Curve3D_method_sample_baked>` method together "
"with :ref:`Curve2D."
"get_baked_length()<class_Curve2D_method_get_baked_length>`. The first call "
"to either of them will bake the curve internally."
msgstr ""
"为了操作起来更方便，需要先把曲线 *烘焙* 成若干等距的点。这样就可以用常规的插"
"值操作（还可以使用立方选项进一步优化）来进行近似估值了。要实现这样的效果，只"
"需调用 :ref:`Curve."
"interpolate_baked()<class_Curve_method_interpolate_baked>` 和 :ref:`Curve2D."
"get_baked_length()<class_Curve2D_method_get_baked_length>` 方法。首次调用两者"
"之中的任意方法都会触发内部对曲线的烘焙。"

msgid ""
"Traversal at constant speed, then, can be done with the following pseudo-"
"code:"
msgstr "匀速遍历, 然后, 可以用下面的伪代码:"

msgid "And the output will, then, move at constant speed:"
msgstr "并且输出, 然后匀速移动:"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
