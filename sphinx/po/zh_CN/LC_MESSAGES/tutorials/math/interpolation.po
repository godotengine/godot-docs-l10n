"Interpolation is a very basic operation in graphics programming. It's good "
"to become familiar with it in order to expand your horizons as a graphics "
"developer."

"The basic idea is that you want to transition from A to B. A value ``t``, "
"represents the states in-between."
msgstr "基本思想是从 A 转换到 B。\\ ``t`` 值是介于两者之间的状态。"

"For example, if ``t`` is 0, then the state is A. If ``t`` is 1, then the "
"state is B. Anything in-between is an *interpolation*."
msgstr ""
"举个例子, 如果 ``t`` 值为0, 那么状态是A. 如果 ``t`` 值是1, 状态是B. 任何介于"
"两者之间的都是 *插值*."

"The name of this type of interpolation, which transforms a value into "
"another at *constant speed* is *\"linear\"*. So, when you hear about *Linear "
"Interpolation*, you know they are referring to this formula."
msgstr ""
"这类型的插值名字, 将一个值以 *恒定速度* 转换成另一个值 *\"线性\"*. 当你听说线"
"性插值时, 就知道他们是指这个简单的公式."

"There are other types of interpolations, which will not be covered here. A "
"recommended read afterwards is the :ref:`Bezier <doc_beziers_and_curves>` "

"还有其他类型的插值, 这里将不做讨论. 建议之后阅读 :ref:`Bezier "

"Vector types (:ref:`Vector2 <class_Vector2>` and :ref:`Vector3 "

"It is also possible to interpolate whole transforms (make sure they have "
"either uniform scale or, at least, the same non-uniform scale). For this, "
"the function :ref:`Transform3D.interpolate_with() "
"<class_Transform3D_method_interpolate_with>` can be used."
msgstr ""
"也可以对整个变换进行插值（确保它们有统一的缩放，或者至少有相同的非统一缩"
