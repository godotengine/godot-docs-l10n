msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"Godot's audio processing code has been written with games in mind, with the "
"aim of achieving an optimal balance between performance and sound quality."
msgstr "Godot的音频处理代码是为了游戏而写的, 以达到性能和音质之间的最佳平衡."

msgid ""
"Godot's audio engine allows any number of audio buses to be created and any "
"number of effect processors can be added to each bus. Only the hardware of "
"the device running your game will limit the number of buses and effects that "
"can be used before performance starts to suffer."
msgstr ""
"Godot的音频引擎允许创建任意数量的音频总线, 并且可以向每个总线添加任意数量的效"
"果处理器. 运行游戏的设备的硬件会限制总线的数量, 以及在性能开始下降之前可以使"
"用的效果."

msgid "Decibel scale"
msgstr "分贝标度"

msgid ""
"Godot's sound interface is designed to meet the expectations of sound design "
"professionals. To this end, it primarily uses the decibel scale."
msgstr ""
"Godot的声音界面是为了满足声音设计专业人士的期望而设计的. 因此主要采用分贝标"
"度."

msgid "For those unfamiliar with it, it can be explained with a few facts:"
msgstr "对于那些不熟悉它的人, 可以用一些事实来解释:"

msgid ""
"The decibel (dB) scale is a relative scale. It represents the ratio of sound "
"power by using 20 times the base 10 logarithm of the ratio (20 × log\\ :sub:"
"`10`\\ (P/P\\ :sub:`0`\\ ))."
msgstr ""
"分贝(dB)标度是一个相对标度. 它等于声功率比的常用对数的20倍(20 × log\\ :sub:"
"`10`\\ (P/P/\\ :sub:`0`\\ ))."

msgid ""
"For every 6 dB, sound amplitude doubles or halves. 12 dB represents a factor "
"of 4, 18 dB a factor of 8, 20 dB a factor of 10, 40 dB a factor of 100, etc."
msgstr ""
"每增/减6分贝, 声幅就会加倍/减半.12dB代表系数4,18dB代表系数8,20dB代表系数"
"10,40dB代表系数100, 以此类推."

msgid ""
"Since the scale is logarithmic, true zero (no audio) can't be represented."
msgstr "由于比例是对数的, 因此无法表示真零(无音频)."

msgid ""
"0 dB is the maximum amplitude possible in a digital audio system. This limit "
"is not the human limit, but a limit from the sound hardware. Audio with "
"amplitudes that are too high to be represented properly below 0 dB create a "
"kind of distortion called *clipping*."
msgstr ""
"0 dB 是数字音频系统中可能的最大振幅. 这个限制不是人为的限制, 而是声音硬件的限"
"制. 因振幅太高而无法完全反映在0dB以下的音频, 会产生一种被称为 *削波* 的失真."

msgid ""
"To avoid clipping, your sound mix should be arranged so that the output of "
"the *master bus* (more on that later) never exceeds 0 dB."
msgstr ""
"为了避免削波，你应该调整混音，使\\ *master 总线*\\ （后面会有更多的介绍）永远"
"不超过 0 dB。"

msgid ""
"Every 6 dB below the 0 dB limit, sound energy is *halved*. It means the "
"sound volume at -6 dB is half as loud as 0dB. -12 dB is half as loud as -6 "
"dB and so on."
msgstr ""
"低于0dB限制的每6dB, 声能就会 *减半* . 这意味着-6dB的音量是0dB的一半. -12dB"
"是-6dB的一半, 依此类推."

msgid ""
"When working with decibels, sound is considered no longer audible between "
"-60 dB and -80 dB. This makes your working range generally between -60 dB "
"and 0 dB."
msgstr ""
"使用分贝时, -60dB和-80dB范围内的声音被认为是听不见的. 也就是说你的工作范围一"
"般在-60dB和0dB之间."

msgid ""
"This can take a bit getting used to, but it's friendlier in the end and will "
"allow you to communicate better with audio professionals."
msgstr ""
"这可能需要一点时间来习惯, 但最终会变得友好, 并且可以让您与音频专业人员更好地"
"进行交流."

msgid "Audio buses can be found in the bottom panel of the Godot editor:"
msgstr "音频总线可以在Godot 编辑器的底部面板中找到:"

msgid ""
"An *audio bus* (also called an *audio channel*) can be considered a place "
"that audio is channeled through on the way to playback through a device's "
"speakers. Audio data can be *modified* and *re-routed* by an audio bus. An "
"audio bus has a VU meter (the bars that light up when sound is played) which "
"indicates the amplitude of the signal passing through."
msgstr ""
"*音频总线* (audio bus)(通常也称为 *音频通道* (audio channel) )是音频从扬声器"
"播放出来之前通过的地方. 它可以 *修改* 和 *重路由* 音频数据. 音频总线有一个 VU"
"表(播放声音时亮起的条形), 表示通过的信号的幅度."

msgid ""
"The leftmost bus is the *master bus*. This bus outputs the mix to your "
"speakers so, as mentioned in the *Decibel scale* section above, make sure "
"that your mix level doesn't reach 0 dB in this bus. The rest of the audio "
"buses can be flexibly routed. After modifying the sound, they send it to "
"another bus to the left. The destination bus can be specified for each of "
"the non-master audio buses. Routing always passes audio from buses on the "
"right to buses further to the left. This avoids infinite routing loops."
msgstr ""
"最左边的总线是 *主总线* . 此总线将混音输出到你的扬声器, 因此, 正如之前 *分贝"
"标度* 部分所述, 请确保主总线中的混音水平永远低于 0 dB. 其余的音频总线可以灵活"
"地进行路由. 在修改声音后, 它们会将其发送到左边的另一条总线上. 非主总线的目标"
"总线可以被单独设置. 而右侧总线的音频会被路由至左侧总线, 这避免了无限循环."

msgid ""
"In the above image, the output of *Bus 2* has been routed to the *Master* "
"bus."
msgstr "在上图中, *Bus 2* 的输出被路由到了 *主* 总线."

msgid "Playback of audio through a bus"
msgstr "通过总线播放音频"

msgid ""
"To test passing audio to a bus, create an AudioStreamPlayer node, load an "
"AudioStream and select a target bus for playback:"
msgstr ""
"要测试将音频传递到总线, 请创建AudioStreamPlayer节点, 加载AudioStream并选择要"
"播放的目标总线:"

msgid "Finally, toggle the **Playing** property to **On** and sound will flow."
msgstr "最后将 **Playing** 属性勾上 **On** , 声音就开始播放了."

msgid ""
"You may also be interested in reading about :ref:`doc_audio_streams` now."
msgstr "你现在可能有兴趣阅读 :ref:`doc_audio_streams`。"

msgid "Adding effects"
msgstr "添加特效"

msgid ""
"Audio buses can contain all sorts of effects. These effects modify the sound "
"in one way or another and are applied in order."
msgstr "音频总线可以包含各种效果. 这些效果以某种方式修改声音并按顺序应用."

msgid ""
"Try them all out to get a sense of how they alter sound. Here follows a "
"short description of the available effects:"
msgstr "全部试一试, 感受声音的改变. 下面是对以上效果的简短描述:"

msgid "Amplify"
msgstr "增幅(Amplify)"

msgid ""
"Amplify changes the amplitude of the signal. Some care needs to be taken. "
"Setting the level too high can make the sound clip, which is usually "
"undesirable."
msgstr ""
"增幅改变信号的振幅. 使用时要小心. 把电平调得太高的话, 声音就会被削波, 这通常"
"是不可取的."

msgid "BandLimit and BandPass"
msgstr "带限和带通(BandLimit and BandPass)"

msgid ""
"These are resonant filters which block frequencies around the *Cutoff* "
"point. BandPass can be used to simulate sound passing through an old "
"telephone line or megaphone. Modulating the BandPass frequency can simulate "
"the sound of a wah-wah guitar pedal, think of the guitar in Jimi Hendrix's "
"*Voodoo Child (Slight Return)*."
msgstr ""
"它们是共振滤波器, 在 *截断* (Cutoff)点附近阻断频率. 带通滤波器可以用来模拟旧"
"电话线路或扩音器传出的声音. 调节带通滤波器的频率, 可以模拟吉他哇音(wah-wah)踏"
"板的声音, 想想吉米·亨德里克斯在 *Voodoo Child (Slight Return)* 中使用的吉他"
"吧."

msgid "Capture"
msgstr "Capture（捕获）"

msgid ""
"The Capture effect copies the audio frames of the audio bus that it is on "
"into an internal buffer. This can be used to capture data from the "
"microphone or to transmit audio over the network in real-time."
msgstr ""
"Capture（采集）效果器会将其所在音频总线的音频帧复制到内部缓冲区中。可用于从麦"
"克风获取音频或通过网络实时传输音频。"

msgid "Chorus"
msgstr "和声(Chorus)"

msgid ""
"The Chorus effect duplicates the incoming audio, delays the duplicate "
"slightly and uses an LFO to continuously modulate the pitch of the "
"duplicated signal before mixing the duplicated signal(s) and the original "
"together again. This creates a shimmering effect and adds stereo width to "
"the sound."
msgstr ""
"和声效果器会复制传入的音频, 稍微延迟重复信号, 并使用低频振荡器连续调节重复信"
"号的音高, 然后再将重复信号(一个或多个)和原始信号混合在一起. 这就产生了一种微"
"光效果, 并增加了声音的立体声宽度."

msgid "Compressor"
msgstr "压缩(Compressor)"

msgid ""
"A dynamic range compressor automatically attenuates the level of the "
"incoming signal when its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. The level of "
"attenuation applied is proportional to how far the incoming audio exceeds "
"the threshold. The compressor's Ratio parameter controls the degree of "
"attenuation. One of the main uses of a compressor is to reduce the dynamic "
"range of signals with very loud and quiet parts. Reducing the dynamic range "
"of a signal can make it easier to mix."
msgstr ""
"当输入信号的幅度超过某一阈值时, 动态范围压缩器会自动衰减该信号的电平. 衰减的"
"程度与传入的音频超过阈值的程度成正比. 压缩器的 \"比例\" 参数控制衰减的系数. "
"压缩器的主要用途之一是, 一个信号具有非常大声和小声的部分时, 压缩器可以用于降"
"低动态范围. 降低信号的动态范围会更方便混音."

msgid "The compressor has many uses. For example:"
msgstr "压缩器有很多用途. 例如:"

msgid "It can be used in the Master bus to compress the whole output."
msgstr "它可以在主总线中用于压缩整体输出."

msgid ""
"It can be used in voice channels to ensure they sound as even as possible."
msgstr "它可以在人声通道中使用, 使它们听起来尽可能均匀."

msgid ""
"It can be *sidechained*. This means it can reduce the sound level of one "
"signal using the level of another audio bus for threshold detection. This "
"technique is very common in video game mixing to \"duck\" the level of music "
"or sound effects when voices need to be heard."
msgstr ""
"它可以是 *Sidechained* . 也就是说, 它可以利用另一个音频总线的电平来降低一个信"
"号的电平, 进行阈值检测. 这种技术在电子游戏混音中非常常见. 在出现语音时, 音乐"
"或音效的电平会被 \"降低\"."

msgid ""
"It can accentuate transients by using a slower attack. This can make sound "
"effects more punchy."
msgstr "它可以通过较慢的启动(attack)来强调瞬态. 让音效听起来更有力."

msgid ""
"If your goal is to prevent a signal from exceeding a given amplitude "
"altogether, rather than to reduce the dynamic range of the signal, a :ref:"
"`limiter <doc_audio_buses_limiter>` is likely a better choice than a "
"compressor."
msgstr ""
"如果你的目标是防止信号总体超过某个振幅限制, 而不是减少信号的动态范围……那么, :"
"ref:`限幅器 (limiter)<doc_audio_buses_limiter>` 可能是比压缩器更好的选择."

msgid "Delay"
msgstr "延迟(Delay)"

msgid ""
"Adds an \"echo\" effect with a feedback loop. It can be used together with "
"*Reverb* to simulate wide rooms, canyons, etc. where sound bounces are far "
"apart."
msgstr ""
"通过反馈回路添加 \"回音\" 效果. 它可以与 *混响* (Reverb)一起使用, 模拟宽阔的"
"房间, 峡谷等声音从远处反弹回来的地方."

msgid "Distortion"
msgstr "失真(Distortion)"

msgid ""
"Makes the sound distorted. Godot offers several types of distortion: "
"*overdrive*, *tan* and *bit crushing*. Distortion can be used to simulate "
"sound coming through a low-quality speaker or device."
msgstr ""
"使声音失真.Godot提供几种类型的失真: *overdrive* , *tan* 和 *bit crushing* . "
"失真可以用来模拟通过低质量扬声器或设备发出的声音."

msgid "EQ"

"数的均衡器."

msgid "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"
msgstr "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"

msgid ""
"Godot provides three equalizers with different numbers of bands. An "
"equalizer on the Master bus can be useful to cut frequencies that the "
"device's speakers can't reproduce well (e.g. a mobile phone's speakers won't "
"reproduce bass content well). The equalizer effect can be disabled when "
"headphones are plugged in."
msgstr ""
"Godot提供三个具有不同频带数的均衡器. 主总线上的均衡器可以有效地削减设备扬声器"
"不能很好地再现的频率(例如, 手机扬声器不能很好地再现低音部分). 插入耳机时可以"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "减少所有高于特定 *截断* 值的频率."

msgid "Limiter"
msgstr "限幅器(Limiter)"

msgid ""
"A limiter is similar to a compressor, but it's less flexible and designed to "
"prevent a signal's amplitude exceeding a given dB threshold. Adding a "
"limiter to the Master bus is a safeguard against clipping."
msgstr ""
"限幅器类似于压缩器, 但灵活性较差, 功能是限制声音不能超过给定的dB阈值. 在主总"
"线上添加一个限制器是防止削波的防护措施."

msgid "LowPassFilter"
msgstr "低通滤波器(LowPassFilter)"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency and can also resonate "
"(boost frequencies close to the *Cutoff* frequency). Low pass filters can be "

msgstr "声像效果允许在左右通道之间调整信号的立体声平衡(戴上耳机试听这个效果)."

msgid "Phaser"
msgstr "移相器(Phaser)"

msgid ""
"It probably does not make much sense to explain that this effect is formed "
"by two signals being dephased and cancelling each other out. You can make a "
"Darth Vader voice with it, or jet-like sounds."

"作达斯 · 维德的声音, 或类似喷射的声音."

msgid "PitchShift"
msgstr "移调(PitchShift)"

msgid ""
