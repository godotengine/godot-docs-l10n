msgid "Console publishing process"
msgstr "主机平台发布流程"

msgid ""
"Regardless of the engine used to create the game, the process to publish a "
"game to a console platform is as follows:"
msgstr "无论使用哪种引擎制作游戏, 将游戏发布到游戏主机平台的流程如下:"

msgid ""
"Register a developer account on the console manufacturer's website, then "
"sign NDAs and publishing contracts. This requires you to have a registered "
"legal entity."
msgstr ""
"在游戏主机制造商的网站上注册一个开发者账号，然后签署 NDA 和出版合同。这需要你"
"有一个注册的法人实体。"

msgid ""
"Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. "
"This can take up to several months. Note that this step is significantly "
"easier if an established publisher is backing your game. Nintendo is "
"generally known to be more accepting of smaller developers, but this is not "
"guaranteed."
msgstr ""
"通过验收程序, 获得进入出版平台的机会. 这可能需要长达几个月的时间. 注意, 如果"
"有成熟的发行商支持你的游戏, 这一步就会明显容易很多. 众所周知, 任天堂通常更接"
"受小型开发商, 但这并不保证."

msgid ""
"Get access to developer tools and order a console specially made for "
"developers (*devkit*). The cost of those devkits is confidential."
msgstr ""
"获得使用开发者工具的权限，并订购专门为开发者制作的游戏主机（\\ "
"*devkit*\\ ）。这些 devkit 的费用是保密的。"

msgid "Port the engine to the console platform or pay a company to do it."
msgstr "把引擎移植到游戏主机平台上，或者花钱请一家公司来做。"

msgid ""
"To be published, your game needs to be rated in the regions you'd like to "
"sell it in. For example, in North America, the `ESRB <https://www.esrb.org/"
">`__ handles game ratings. In Europe, this is done by `PEGI <https://pegi."
"info/>`__. Indie developers can generally get a rating for cheaper compared "
"to more established developers."
msgstr ""
"要想出版，你的游戏需要在你想销售的地区进行评级。例如在北美，\\ `ESRB "
"<https://www.esrb.org/>`__ 处理游戏评级。在欧洲，这是由 `PEGI <https://pegi."
"info/>`__ 完成的。与更成熟的开发商相比，独立开发商通常可以以更低的价格获得评"
"级。"

msgid ""
"Due to the complexity of the process, the budget to publish a game by "
"yourself on a single console often exceeds $1,000 (this is a rough figure)."
msgstr ""
"由于流程复杂，自己在主机上发布一款游戏的预算往往超过 1000 美元（这是一个粗略"
"的数字）。"

msgid "Official support"
msgstr "官方支持"

msgid ""
"Godot supports the Linux-based Steam Deck. The reason other consoles are not "
"officially supported are:"
msgstr "Godot 支持基于 Linux 的 Steam Deck。其他主机尚未获得官方支持的原因有："

msgid ""
"To develop for consoles, one must be licensed as a company. As an open "
"source project, Godot does not have such a legal figure."
msgstr ""
"要为游戏机开发游戏, 必须获得公司许可. 作为一个开源项目,Godot没有这样的法律部"
"分."

msgid ""
"Console SDKs are secret and covered by non-disclosure agreements. Even if we "
"could get access to them, we could not publish the platform-specific code "
"under an open source license."
msgstr ""
"游戏机的SDK是保密的, 并由保密协议保护. 即使我们可以访问它们, 我们也无法在开源"
"许可下发布特定平台的代码."

msgid ""
"Consoles require specialized hardware to develop for, so regular individuals "
"can't create games for them anyway."
msgstr ""
"游戏机的游戏开发需要专门的硬件, 因此普通人无论如何也无法为游戏机创建游戏."

msgid ""
"However, it is still possible to port your games to consoles thanks to "
"services provided by third-party companies."
msgstr "但是，基于第三方公司提供的服务，仍然可以将游戏移植到游戏机中。"

msgid ""
"In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine, except "
"that you need to contact a third-party developer to handle the porting "
"process. In other words, there is no engine that is legally allowed to "
"distribute console export templates without requiring the user to prove that "
"they are a licensed console developer. Doing so would violate the console "
"manufacturer's NDA."
msgstr ""
"实际上，这个过程与 Unity 和虚幻引擎十分相似，只是你需要联系第三方开发者来处理"
"移植过程。换句话说，在法律上，没有任何一个引擎可以在不要求用户证明自己是授权"
"的游戏机开发者的情况下发布游戏机导出模板。这样做会违反游戏主机制造商的 NDA。"
