"In order to develop for consoles in Godot, you need access to the console "
"SDK and export templates for it. These export templates need to be developed "
"either by yourself or someone hired to do it, or provided by a third party "
"company."

"To develop for consoles, one must be licensed as a company. As an open "

"In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine. In "
"other words, there is no engine that is legally allowed to distribute "
"console export templates without requiring the user to prove that they are a "
"licensed console developer."
msgstr ""
"实际上，这个过程与 Unity 和虚幻引擎十分相似，只是你需要联系第三方开发者来处理"
"移植过程。换句话说，在法律上，没有任何一个引擎可以在不要求用户证明自己是授权"
"的游戏机开发者的情况下发布游戏机导出模板。这样做会违反游戏主机制造商的 NDA。"

"Regardless of the engine used to create the game, the process to publish a "

"Register a developer account on the console manufacturer's website, then "

msgstr ""
"在游戏主机制造商的网站上注册一个开发者账号，然后签署 NDA 和出版合同。这需要你"
"有一个注册的法人实体。"

msgid ""
"Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. "
"This can take up to several months. Note that this step is significantly "
"easier if an established publisher is backing your game. Nintendo is "
"generally known to be more accepting of smaller developers, but this is not "
"guaranteed."
msgstr ""
"通过验收程序, 获得进入出版平台的机会. 这可能需要长达几个月的时间. 注意, 如果"
"有成熟的发行商支持你的游戏, 这一步就会明显容易很多. 众所周知, 任天堂通常更接"
"受小型开发商, 但这并不保证."

"Get access to developer tools and order a console specially made for "

"To be published, your game needs to be rated in the regions you'd like to "
