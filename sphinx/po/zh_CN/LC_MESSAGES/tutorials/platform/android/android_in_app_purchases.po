"Godot offers a first-party ``GodotGooglePlayBilling`` Android plugin "
"compatible with Godot 3.2.2 and higher. This plugin uses the `Google Play "
"Billing library <https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing>`__ "
"instead of the now deprecated AIDL IAP implementation. For details of how to "
"migrate from the older ``GodotPaymentsV3``, see the migration guide: "
"`Migrating from Godot 3.2.1 and lower (GodotPaymentsV3)`_."

"自 Godot 3.2.2 以来，Godot提供了一个第一方的 ``GodotGooglePlayBilling`` "
"Android 插件。新插件使用 `Google Play Billing 库 <https://developer.android."
