"In order to pack all resources of a project into a PCK file open the project "

"为了将项目的所有资源打包到 PCK 文件中，请打开项目并转到项目/导出，然后点击“导"
"出 PCK/Zip”。还要确保在执行此操作时选择了导出模板。"

msgid ""
"Another method would be to :ref:`export from the command line "
"<doc_command_line_tutorial_exporting>`. If the output file ends with a PCK "
"or ZIP file extension, then the export process will build that type of file "

msgstr ""
"另一种方法是 :ref:`从命令行导出 <doc_command_line_tutorial_exporting>`. 如果"
"输出文件以PCK或ZIP文件扩展名结尾, 则导出过程将为所选平台构建该类型的文件."

"If one wishes to support mods for their game, they will need their users to "

msgstr ""
"如果有人希望为他们的游戏支持 mod，他们将需要其用户创建类似的导出文件。假设原"
"始游戏需要 PCK 资源的某种结构和/或其脚本具有特定的接口，那么有两种选择……"

msgid ""
"The developer must publicize documentation of these expected structures/ "
"interfaces, expect modders to install Godot Engine, and then also expect "
"those modders to conform to the documentation's defined API when building "
"mod content for the game (so that it will work). Users would then use "
"Godot's built in exporting tools to create a PCK file, as detailed above."
msgstr ""
"开发人员必须公开这些预期结构/接口的文档，期望模组制作者安装 Godot 引擎，然"
"后，在为游戏构建 Mod 内容时，这些修改者也将遵守文档中定义的 API（这样它将起作"
"用）。用户然后将如上所述，使用 Godot 的内置导出工具来创建 PCK 文件。"

msgid ""
"The developer uses Godot to build a GUI tool for adding their exact API "
"content to a project. This Godot tool must either run on a tools-enabled "
"build of the engine or have access to one (distributed alongside or perhaps "
"in the original game's files). The tool can then use the Godot executable to "
"export a PCK file from the command line with :ref:`OS.execute() "
"<class_OS_method_execute>`. The game itself shouldn't use a tool-build of "
"the engine (for security), so it's best to keep the modding tool and game "
"separate."
msgstr ""
"开发者使用 Godot 来构建 GUI 工具，用这个工具向项目中添加特定的 API 内容。这"
"个 Godot 工具要么是在启用了工具构建的引擎上执行，要么就必须能够访问到这种版本"
"的邀请（一同分发，或者加入到原版游戏的文件之中）。这样这个工具就可以使用 :"
"ref:`OS.execute() <class_OS_method_execute>` 通过命令行使用 Godot 可执行文件"
"来导出 PCK 文件。游戏本体不应该使用工具构建的引擎（出于安全考虑），所以最好"
"将 mod 工具和游戏分开。"

msgid "Opening PCK files at runtime"
msgstr "在运行时打开 PCK 文件"

msgid ""
"To import a PCK file, one uses the ProjectSettings singleton. The following "
"example expects a “mod.pck” file in the directory of the games executable. "
"The PCK file contains a “mod_scene.tscn” test scene in its root."
msgstr ""
"要导入PCK文件，需要使用ProjectSettings单例。下面的例子期望在游戏可执行目录中"
"有一个 “mod.pck” 文件。该PCK文件的根目录包含一个 “mod_scene.tscn” 测试场景。"

msgid ""
"By default, if you import a file with the same file path/name as one you "
"already have in your project, the imported one will replace it. This is "
"something to watch out for when creating DLC or mods. You can solve this "
"problem by using a tool that isolates mods to a specific mods subfolder. "
"However, it is also a way of creating patches for one's own game. A PCK file "
"of this kind can fix the content of a previously loaded PCK."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下，如果导入的文件与项目中已有的文件具有相同的文件路径和名称，则导入"
"的文件将替换它。创建 DLC 或 mod 时需要注意这一点，可以使用工具将 mod 隔离到特"
"定 mod 子文件夹来解决此问题。然而，这也是为自己的游戏创建补丁的一种方式。这种"
"类型的 PCK 文件可以修复先前加载的 PCK 的内容。"

msgid ""
"To opt out of this behavior, pass ``false`` as the second argument to :ref:"
"`ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack() "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_load_resource_pack>`."
msgstr ""
"为了退出这个行为, 把 ``false`` 作为第二个参数传递给 :ref:`ProjectSettings."
"load_resource_pack() <class_ProjectSettings_method_load_resource_pack>`."

msgid ""
"For a C# project, you need to build the DLL and place it in the project "
"directory first. Then, before loading the resource pack, you need to load "
"its DLL as follows: ``Assembly.LoadFile(\"mod.dll\")``"
msgstr ""
"对于C#项目, 你必需先构建DLL并把它放在项目目录中. 然后, 在加载资源包之前, 你需"
"要按如下方法加载它的DLL:``Assembly.LoadFile(\"mod.dll\")``"

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "总结"

msgid ""
"This tutorial explains how to add mods, patches, or DLC to a game. The most "
"important thing is to identify how one plans to distribute future content "
"for their game and develop a workflow that is customized for that purpose. "
"Godot should make that process smooth regardless of which route a developer "
"pursues."
msgstr ""
"本教程介绍如何向游戏添加模组、补丁或 DLC。最重要的是确定一个人计划如何为其游"
"戏分发未来的内容，并开发为此目的定制的工作流程。无论开发人员选择哪种方法，"
"Godot 都应该使该过程顺利进行。"
