"Now that you have a working game, you probably want to share your success "
"with others. However, it's not practical to ask your friends to download "
"Godot just so they can open your project. Instead, you can *export* your "
"project, converting it into a \"package\" that can be run by anyone."
msgstr ""
"现在您已经有了一个可以运行的游戏，您可能想要和别人分享您的成果。然而，让您的"
"朋友只为了打开您的项目而下载 Godot 是不实际的。相反，您可以\\ *导出*\\ 您的项"

"The way you export your game depends on what platform you are targeting. In "

msgid ""
"In *Dodge the Creeps*, we used keyboard controls to move the player's "
"character. This is fine if your game is being played on a PC platform, but "
"on a phone or tablet, you need to support touchscreen input. Because a click "
"event can be treated the same as a touch event, we'll convert the game to a "
"click-and-move input style."
msgstr ""
"在 *Dodge the Creeps* 中，我们使用键盘控制玩家角色移动。如果游戏是在 PC 平台"
"上进行的就没问题，但在手机或平板电脑上，就需要支持触屏输入。其点击事件可以和"
"触摸事件一样处理，所以会将游戏转换为点击移动的输入方式。"

msgid ""
"By default, Godot emulates mouse input from touch input. That means that if "
"anything is coded to happen on a mouse event, touch will trigger it as well. "
"Godot can also emulate touch input from mouse clicks, which we will need to "
"be able to keep playing our game on our computer after we switch to touch "
"input."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下，Godot 会从触摸输入中模拟鼠标输入。这意味着，如果已经针对鼠标事件"
"编写了代码，触摸时也会触发它。Godot 还可以从鼠标点击中模拟触摸输入，为了需要"
"在切换到触摸输入后，能够继续在电脑上玩我们的游戏。"

msgid ""
"In **Project > Project Settings**, under **Input Devices > Pointing**, "
"enable **Emulate Touch From Mouse**."
msgstr ""
"在 **项目>项目设置** 的 **Input Devices > Pointing**\\ （输入设备 > 触点）"
"下，启用 **Emulate Touch From Mouse**\\ （根据鼠标模拟触摸）。"

msgid ""
"We also want to ensure that the game scales consistently on different-sized "
"screens, so in the project settings go to **Display**, then click on "
"**Window**. In the **Stretch** options, set **Mode** to ``2d`` and "
"**Aspect** to ``keep``."
msgstr ""
"我们还想确保游戏在不同尺寸的屏幕上有一致的比例，所以在项目设置中进入 "
"**Display**\\ ，然后点击 **Window**\\ 。在 **Stretch** 选项中，将 **Mode** 设"
"置为 ``2d``\\ ，\\ **Aspect** 设置为 ``keep``\\ 。"

msgid ""
"Since we are already in the **Window** settings, we should also set under "
"**Handheld** the **Orientation** to ``portrait``."
msgstr ""
"由于我们已经在 **Window** 设置中，还应该在 **Handheld**\\ （手持设备）下将 "
"**Orientation**\\ （方向）设置为 ``portrait``\\ （竖屏）。"

msgid ""
"Next, we need to modify the ``Player.gd`` script to change the input method. "
"We'll remove the key inputs and make the player move towards a \"target\" "
"that's set by the touch (or click) event."
msgstr ""
"接下来，我们需要修改 ``Player.gd`` 脚本来改变输入方式。我们将移除键盘输入并使"
