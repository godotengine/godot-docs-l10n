"Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the "
"export system. When exporting for Windows, the exporter takes all the "
"project files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is bundled with a "
"specially optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does not contain the "
"editor and debugger."

"Godot 在使用导出系统时，为 PC 分发提供了一种更为优雅的方法。为 Windows 导出"
