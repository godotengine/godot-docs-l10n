msgid "Exporting projects"
msgstr "导出项目"

msgid "Why export?"
msgstr "为什么要导出？"

msgid ""
"Originally, Godot did not have any means to export projects. The developers "
"would compile the proper binaries and build the packages for each platform "
"manually."
msgstr ""
"起初，Godot 没有任何导出项目的方法。开发人员需要为各个平台手动编译正确的二进"
"制文件并打包。"

msgid ""
"When more developers (and even non-programmers) started using it, and when "
"our company started taking more projects at the same time, it became evident "
"that this was a bottleneck."
msgstr ""
"后来用它的开发人员（甚至是非程序员）多了起来，我们的公司也开始同时进行更多的"
"项目，这就明显成了一个瓶颈。"

msgid "On PC"
msgstr "在 PC 上"

msgid ""
"Distributing a game project on PC with Godot is rather easy. Drop the Godot "
"binary in the same directory as the ``project.godot`` file, then compress "
"the project directory and you are done."
msgstr ""
"使用 Godot 在 PC 上分发游戏项目相当容易。将 Godot 二进制文件拖放到与 "
"``project.godot`` 文件相同的目录中，然后压缩项目目录即可。"

msgid ""
"It sounds simple, but there are probably a few reasons why the developer may "
"not want to do this. The first one is that it may not be desirable to "
"distribute loads of files. Some developers may not like curious users "
"peeking at how the game was made, others may find it inelegant, and so on. "
"Another reason is that the developer might prefer a specially-compiled "
"binary, which is smaller in size, more optimized and does not include tools "
"like the editor and debugger."
msgstr ""
"这听起来很简单, 但开发人员可能不想这样做的原因可能有几个. 第一个原因是可能不"
"希望分发大量文件. 一些开发人员可能不喜欢好奇的用户偷看游戏的制作方式, 其他开"
"发人员可能会发现它不雅致, 等等. 另一个原因是, 开发人员可能更喜欢特殊编译的二"
"进制文件, 该二进制文件的大小较小, 更优化, 并且不包含编辑器和调试器之类的工具."

msgid ""
"Finally, Godot has a simple but efficient system for :ref:`creating DLCs as "
"extra package files <doc_exporting_pcks>`."
msgstr ""
"最后,Godot有一个简单但有效的系统, 用于 :ref:`将DLC 创建为额外的包文件 "
"<doc_exporting_pcks>` ."

msgid "On mobile"
msgstr "在移动端"

msgid ""
"The same scenario on mobile platforms is a little worse. To distribute a "
"project on those devices, a binary for each of those platforms is built, "
"then added to a native project together with the game data."
msgstr ""
"移动设备中的相同情况会更糟糕. 要在这些设备上分发项目, 需要为每个平台构建一个"
"二进制文件, 然后将其与游戏数据一起添加到本地项目中."

msgid ""
"This can be troublesome because it means that the developer must be "
"familiarized with the SDK of each platform before even being able to export. "
"While learning each SDK is always encouraged, it can be frustrating to be "
"forced to do it at an undesired time."
msgstr ""
"这可能很麻烦, 因为这意味着开发人员必须熟悉每个平台的SDK, 才能进行导出. 虽然总"
"是鼓励学习每个SDK, 但在不希望的时间被迫这样做可能会令人沮丧."

msgid ""
"There is also another problem with this approach: different devices prefer "
"some data in different formats to run. The main example of this is texture "
"compression. All PC hardware uses S3TC (BC) compression and that has been "
"standardized for more than a decade, but mobile devices use different "
"formats for texture compression, such as PVRTC (iOS) or ETC (Android)."
msgstr ""
"这种方法还有另一个问题: 不同的设备偏好一些不同格式的数据来运行. 这个主要的示"
"例是纹理压缩. 所有PC硬件都使用S3TC(BC)压缩, 并且已经标准化了十多年, 但是移动"
"设备使用不同的格式进行纹理压缩, 例如PVRTC(iOS)或ETC(Android)."

msgid "Export menu"
msgstr "导出菜单"

msgid ""
"After many attempts at different export workflows, the current one has "
"proven to work the best. At the time of this writing, not all platforms are "
"supported yet, but the supported platforms continue to grow."
msgstr ""
"经过多次尝试不同的导出工作流程后, 目前的工作流程已被证明是最好的. 在撰写本文"
"时, 并不是所有平台都支持, 但受支持的平台仍在继续增长."

msgid "To open the export menu, click the **Export** button:"
msgstr "要打开导出菜单, 请单击 **导出** 按钮:"

msgid ""
"The export menu will open. However, it will be completely empty. This is "
"because we need to add an export preset."
msgstr "导出菜单将打开, 但它完全是空的. 这是因为我们需要添加导出预设."

msgid ""
"To create an export preset, click the **Add…** button at the top of the "
"export menu. This will open a drop-down list of platforms to choose from for "
"an export preset."
msgstr ""
"要创建导出预设，请点击导出菜单顶部的\\ **添加...** 按钮。这将打开一个平台下拉"
"列表，以从中选择导出预设。"

msgid ""
"The default options are often enough to export, so tweaking them is usually "
"not necessary. However, many platforms require additional tools (SDKs) to be "
"installed to be able to export. Additionally, Godot needs export templates "
"installed to create packages. The export menu will complain when something "
"is missing and will not allow the user to export for that platform until "
"they resolve it:"
msgstr ""
"一般使用默认选项导出就足够了，通常无需对其进行调整。但是，许多平台都需要安装"
"其他工具（SDK）才能导出。此外，Godot 需要安装导出模板来创建软件包。缺少某些内"
"容时，导出菜单将发出提示，并且在解决该问题之前，用户将无法为该平台进行导出："

msgid ""
"At that time, the user is expected to come back to the documentation and "
"follow instructions on how to properly set up that platform."
msgstr "那时，用户需要回到文档并按照有关如何正确设置该平台的说明进行操作。"

msgid "Export templates"
msgstr "导出模板"

msgid ""
"Apart from setting up the platform, the export templates must be installed "
"to be able to export projects. They can be obtained as a TPZ file (which is "
"a renamed ZIP archive) from the `download page of the website <https://www."
"godotengine.org/download>`_."
msgstr ""
"除了设置平台，还必须安装导出模板才能导出项目。可以从\\ `网站的下载页面 "
"<https://www.godotengine.org/download>`_\\ 中获取，得到的是一个 TPZ 文件（重"
"命名的 ZIP 存档）。"

msgid ""
"Once downloaded, they can be installed using the **Install Export "
"Templates** option in the editor:"
msgstr "下载完成后，就可以使用编辑器中的\\ **安装导出模板**\\ 选项进行安装："

msgid "Resource options"
msgstr "资源选项"

msgid ""
"When exporting, Godot makes a list of all the files to export and then "
"creates the package. There are 3 different modes for exporting:"
msgstr ""
"导出时，Godot 会先创建一个所有要导出的文件的列表，然后再创建包。有 3 种不同的"
"导出模式："

msgid "Export all resources in the project"
msgstr "导出项目中的所有资源"

msgid "Export selected scenes (and dependencies)"
msgstr "导出选中的场景（包括依赖项）"

msgid "Export selected resources (and dependencies)"
msgstr "导出选中的资源（包括依赖项）"

msgid ""
"**Export all resources in the project** will export every resource in the "
"project. **Export selected scenes** and **Export selected resources** gives "
"you a list of the scenes or resources in the project, and you have to select "
"every scene or resource you want to export."
msgstr ""
"**导出项目中的所有资源**\\ 将会导出项目中的每一个资源。\\ **导出选中的场景"
"**\\ 和\\ **导出选中的资源**\\ 会给你一张项目中的场景或资源的清单，你需要选取"
"每个想导出的场景或资源。"

msgid ""
"Files and folders whose name begin with a period will never be included in "
"the exported project. This is done to prevent version control folders like "
"``.git`` from being included in the exported PCK file."
msgstr ""
"导出的项目永远不会包含名字以点开头的文件和文件夹。这是为了防止将 ``.git`` 等"
"版本控制文件夹加入导出的 PCK 文件。"

msgid ""
"Below the list of resources are two filters that can be setup. The first "
"allows non resource files such as ``.txt``,``.json`` and ``.csv`` to be "
"exported with the project. The second filter can be used to exclude every "
"file of a certain type without manually deselecting every one. For example, "
"``.png`` files."
msgstr ""
"在资源列表之下，是两个可以设置的筛选器。第一个可以让 ``.txt``\\ 、\\ ``."
"json``\\ 、\\ ``.csv`` 等非资源文件与项目一起导出。第二个可以用来排除特定类型"
"的文件，这样就不必手动一个个去取消选择了。例如 ``.png`` 文件。"

msgid "Exporting from the command line"
msgstr "从命令行导出"

msgid ""
"In production, it is useful to automate builds, and Godot supports this with "
"the ``--export`` and ``--export-debug`` command line parameters. Exporting "
"from the command line still requires an export preset to define the export "
"parameters. A basic invocation of the command would be:"
msgstr ""
"在生产中, 自动化构建很有用,Godot使用 ``--export`` 和 ``--export-debug`` 命令"
"行参数来支持它. 从命令行导出仍需要导出预设来定义导出参数. 该命令的基本调用将"
"是:"

msgid ""
"This will export to ``some_name.exe``, assuming there is a preset called "
"\"Windows Desktop\" and the template can be found. (The export preset name "
"must be written within quotes if it contains spaces or special characters.) "
"The output path is *relative to the project path* or *absolute*; **it does "
"not respect the directory the command was invoked from**."
msgstr ""
"假设有一个名为“Windows Desktop”的预设，并且可以找到模板，它将导出为 "
"``some_name.exe``\\ （如果导出预设的名字中存在空格或特殊字符，就必须放在引号"
"里）。输出路径是\\ *相对于项目的路径*\\ 或者\\ *绝对路径*\\ ；\\ **它使用的不"
"是命令被调用时的目录**\\ 。"

msgid ""
"The output file extension should match the one used by the Godot export "
"process:"
msgstr "输出的文件扩展名应该与 Godot 导出过程所使用的相匹配："

msgid "Windows: ``.exe``"
msgstr "Windows：\\ ``.exe``"

msgid ""
"macOS: ``.zip`` (from all platforms) or ``.dmg`` (only when exporting *from* "
"macOS). ``.app`` is not supported directly, although the generated ZIP "
"archive contains an ``.app`` bundle."
msgstr ""
"macOS：\\ ``.zip``\\ （所有平台均可导出）或 ``.dmg``\\ （只能\\ *从* macOS 导"

msgid ""
"You can also configure it to export *only* the PCK or ZIP file, allowing a "
"single exported main pack file to be used with multiple Godot executables. "
"When doing so, the export preset name must still be specified on the command "
"line:"
msgstr ""
"你还可以将其配置为\\ *仅*\\ 导出 PCK 或 ZIP 文件，能够让多个 Godot 可执行文件"
"执行同一个导出的主包文件。这样做时，仍然必须在命令行中指明导出预设的名称："

msgid ""
"It is often useful to combine the ``--export`` flag with the ``--path`` "
"flag, so that you do not need to ``cd`` to the project folder before running "
"the command:"
msgstr ""
"将 ``--export`` 标志与 ``--path`` 标志组合起来通常很有用，这样你就不必在运行"
