msgid "Exporting projects"
msgstr "导出项目"

msgid "Why export?"
msgstr "为什么要导出？"

msgid ""
"Originally, Godot did not have any means to export projects. The developers "
"would compile the proper binaries and build the packages for each platform "
"manually."
msgstr ""
"起初，Godot 没有任何导出项目的方法。开发人员需要为各个平台手动编译正确的二进"
"制文件并打包。"

msgid ""
"When more developers (and even non-programmers) started using it, and when "
"our company started taking more projects at the same time, it became evident "
"that this was a bottleneck."
msgstr ""
"后来用它的开发人员（甚至是非程序员）多了起来，我们的公司也开始同时进行更多的"
"项目，这就明显成了一个瓶颈。"

msgid "On PC"
msgstr "在 PC 上"

msgid ""
"Distributing a game project on PC with Godot is rather easy. Drop the Godot "
"binary in the same directory as the ``project.godot`` file, then compress "
"the project directory and you are done."
msgstr ""
"使用 Godot 在 PC 上分发游戏项目相当容易。将 Godot 二进制文件拖放到与 "
"``project.godot`` 文件相同的目录中，然后压缩项目目录即可。"

msgid ""
"It sounds simple, but there are probably a few reasons why the developer may "
"not want to do this. The first one is that it may not be desirable to "
"distribute loads of files. Some developers may not like curious users "
"peeking at how the game was made, others may find it inelegant, and so on. "
"Another reason is that the developer might prefer a specially-compiled "
"binary, which is smaller in size, more optimized and does not include tools "
"like the editor and debugger."
msgstr ""
"这听起来很简单, 但开发人员可能不想这样做的原因可能有几个. 第一个原因是可能不"
"希望分发大量文件. 一些开发人员可能不喜欢好奇的用户偷看游戏的制作方式, 其他开"
"发人员可能会发现它不雅致, 等等. 另一个原因是, 开发人员可能更喜欢特殊编译的二"
"进制文件, 该二进制文件的大小较小, 更优化, 并且不包含编辑器和调试器之类的工具."

msgid ""
"Finally, Godot has a simple but efficient system for :ref:`creating DLCs as "
"extra package files <doc_exporting_pcks>`."
msgstr ""
"最后,Godot有一个简单但有效的系统, 用于 :ref:`将DLC 创建为额外的包文件 "
"<doc_exporting_pcks>` ."

msgid "On mobile"
msgstr "在移动端"

msgid ""
"The same scenario on mobile platforms is a little worse. To distribute a "
"project on those devices, a binary for each of those platforms is built, "
"then added to a native project together with the game data."
msgstr ""
"移动设备中的相同情况会更糟糕. 要在这些设备上分发项目, 需要为每个平台构建一个"
"二进制文件, 然后将其与游戏数据一起添加到本地项目中."

msgid ""
"This can be troublesome because it means that the developer must be "
"familiarized with the SDK of each platform before even being able to export. "
"While learning each SDK is always encouraged, it can be frustrating to be "
"forced to do it at an undesired time."
msgstr ""
"这可能很麻烦, 因为这意味着开发人员必须熟悉每个平台的SDK, 才能进行导出. 虽然总"
"是鼓励学习每个SDK, 但在不希望的时间被迫这样做可能会令人沮丧."

msgid ""
"There is also another problem with this approach: different devices prefer "
"some data in different formats to run. The main example of this is texture "
"compression. All PC hardware uses S3TC (BC) compression and that has been "
"standardized for more than a decade, but mobile devices use different "
"formats for texture compression, such as ETC1 and ETC2."
msgstr ""
"这种方法还有另一个问题: 不同的设备偏好一些不同格式的数据来运行. 这个主要的示"
"例是纹理压缩. 所有PC硬件都使用S3TC(BC)压缩, 并且已经标准化了十多年, 但是移动"
"设备使用不同的格式进行纹理压缩, 例如PVRTC(iOS)或ETC(Android)."

msgid "Export menu"
msgstr "导出菜单"

msgid ""
"After many attempts at different export workflows, the current one has "
"proven to work the best. At the time of this writing, not all platforms are "
"supported yet, but the supported platforms continue to grow."
msgstr ""
"经过多次尝试不同的导出工作流程后, 目前的工作流程已被证明是最好的. 在撰写本文"
"时, 并不是所有平台都支持, 但受支持的平台仍在继续增长."

msgid "To open the export menu, click the **Export** button:"
msgstr "要打开导出菜单, 请单击 **导出** 按钮:"

msgid ""
"The export menu will open. However, it will be completely empty. This is "
"because we need to add an export preset."
msgstr "导出菜单将打开, 但它完全是空的. 这是因为我们需要添加导出预设."

msgid ""
"To create an export preset, click the **Add…** button at the top of the "
"export menu. This will open a drop-down list of platforms to choose from for "
"an export preset."
msgstr ""
"要创建导出预设，请点击导出菜单顶部的\\ **添加...** 按钮。这将打开一个平台下拉"
"列表，以从中选择导出预设。"

msgid ""
"The default options are often enough to export, so tweaking them is usually "
"not necessary. However, many platforms require additional tools (SDKs) to be "
"installed to be able to export. Additionally, Godot needs export templates "
"installed to create packages. The export menu will complain when something "
"is missing and will not allow the user to export for that platform until "
"they resolve it:"
msgstr ""
"一般使用默认选项导出就足够了，通常无需对其进行调整。但是，许多平台都需要安装"
"其他工具（SDK）才能导出。此外，Godot 需要安装导出模板来创建软件包。缺少某些内"
"容时，导出菜单将发出提示，并且在解决该问题之前，用户将无法为该平台进行导出："

msgid ""
"At that time, the user is expected to come back to the documentation and "
"follow instructions on how to properly set up that platform."
msgstr "那时，用户需要回到文档并按照有关如何正确设置该平台的说明进行操作。"

msgid ""
"The buttons at the bottom of the menu allow you to export the project in a "
"few different ways:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Export All: Export the project as a playable build (Godot executable and "
"project data) for all the presets defined. All presets must have an **Export "
"Path** defined for this to work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Export Project: Export the project as a playable build (Godot executable and "
"project data) for the selected preset."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Export PCK/ZIP: Export the project resources as a PCK or ZIP package. This "
"is not a playable build, it only exports the project data without a Godot "
"executable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Export templates"
msgstr "导出模板"

msgid ""
"Apart from setting up the platform, the export templates must be installed "
"to be able to export projects. They can be obtained as a TPZ file (which is "
"a renamed ZIP archive) from the `download page of the website <https://www."
"godotengine.org/download>`_."
msgstr ""
"除了设置平台，还必须安装导出模板才能导出项目。可以从\\ `网站的下载页面 "
"<https://www.godotengine.org/download>`_\\ 中获取，得到的是一个 TPZ 文件（重"
"命名的 ZIP 存档）。"

msgid ""
"Once downloaded, they can be installed using the **Install Export "
"Templates** option in the editor:"
msgstr "下载完成后，就可以使用编辑器中的\\ **安装导出模板**\\ 选项进行安装："

msgid "Resource options"
msgstr "资源选项"

msgid ""
"When exporting, Godot makes a list of all the files to export and then "
"creates the package. There are 3 different modes for exporting:"
msgstr ""
"导出时，Godot 会先创建一个所有要导出的文件的列表，然后再创建包。有 3 种不同的"
"导出模式："

msgid "Export all resources in the project"
msgstr "导出项目中的所有资源"

msgid "Export selected scenes (and dependencies)"
msgstr "导出选中的场景（包括依赖项）"

"**Export all resources in the project** will export every resource in the "

"每个想导出的场景或资源。"

msgid ""
"Files and folders whose name begin with a period will never be included in "
"the exported project. This is done to prevent version control folders like "
"``.git`` from being included in the exported PCK file."
msgstr ""
"导出的项目永远不会包含名字以点开头的文件和文件夹。这是为了防止将 ``.git`` 等"
"版本控制文件夹加入导出的 PCK 文件。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Below the list of resources are two filters that can be setup. The first "
"allows non resource files such as ``.txt``, ``.json`` and ``.csv`` to be "
"exported with the project. The second filter can be used to exclude every "
"file of a certain type without manually deselecting every one. For example, "
"``.png`` files."
msgstr ""
"在资源列表之下，是两个可以设置的筛选器。第一个可以让 ``.txt``\\ 、\\ ``."

"The export configuration is stored in two files that can both be found in "

msgstr "导出配置存储在两个文件中，这两个文件都可以在项目目录中找到："

"configuration and can be safely committed to version control. There is "
"nothing in here that you would normally have to keep secret."
msgstr ""
"``export_presets.cfg`` ：此文件中包含绝大多数导出配置，可以安全地提交到版本控"
"制。这里的内容通常没有什么是你需要保密的。"

msgid ""
"``.godot/export_credentials.cfg``: This file contains export options that "
"are considered confidential, like passwords and encryption keys. It should "
"generally **not** be committed to version control or shared with others "
"unless you know exactly what you are doing."
msgstr ""
"``.godot/export_credentials.cfg`` ：此文件包含被视为机密的导出选项，例如密码"
"和加密密钥。通常 **不** 用版本控制或与其他人共享，除非你确切知道自己在做什"
"么。"

msgid ""
"Since the credentials file is usually kept out of version control systems, "
"some export options will be missing if you clone the project to a new "
"machine. The easiest way to deal with this is to copy the file manually from "
"the old location to the new one."
msgstr ""
"由于凭证文件通常不包含在版本控制系统中，因此如果将项目克隆到新计算机，某些导"
"出选项将会丢失。处理此问题的最简单方法是手动将文件从旧位置复制到新位置。"

msgid "Exporting from the command line"
msgstr "从命令行导出"

msgid ""
"In production, it is useful to automate builds, and Godot supports this with "
"the ``--export`` and ``--export-debug`` command line parameters. Exporting "

"parameters. A basic invocation of the command would be:"

"\"Windows Desktop\" and the template can be found. (The export preset name "
