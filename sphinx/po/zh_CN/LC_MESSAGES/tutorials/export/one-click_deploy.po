msgstr "什么是一键部署？"

"One-click deploy is a feature that is available once a platform is properly "
"configured and a supported device is connected to the computer. Since things "
"can go wrong at many levels (platform may not be configured correctly, SDK "
"may be incorrectly installed, device may be improperly configured, etc.), "
"it's good to let the user know that it exists."
msgstr ""
"平台配置正确并且将支持的设备连接到电脑上之后，就可以使用一键部署功能。因为能"
"出错的地方太多了（平台可能没有配置正确、SDK 可能没有正确安装、设备可能配置错"
"了等等），所以最好让用户先知道有这样的功能。"

"After adding an Android export preset marked as Runnable, Godot can detect "
"when a USB device is connected to the computer and offer the user to "
"automatically export, install and run the project (in debug mode) on the "
"device. This feature is called *one-click deploy*."

"One-click deploy is only available once you've added an export template "

"runnable. If you mark a second preset in a given platform as runnable, the "
"other preset will no longer be marked as runnable."
msgstr ""
"在导出对话框中添加导出模板并标记为\\ **可执行**\\ 后便可使用一键部署。你可以"
