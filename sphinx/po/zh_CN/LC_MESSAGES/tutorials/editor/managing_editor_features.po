"In certain situations, it may be desirable to limit what features can be "
"used in the Godot editor. For example, a UI designer on a team who doesn't "
"need to see 3D features, or an educator slowly introducing features to "
"students. Godot has a built in system called \"feature profiles\" to do this."
msgstr ""
"某些情况下，我们可能会想要限制 Godot 编辑器所能使用的功能。例如，团队中的 UI "
"设计师无需见到 3D 功能，而老师会想要逐步向学生介绍功能。Godot 内置的“功能配"
"置”系统可以实现这样的需求。"

msgid ""
"With feature profiles, major features and nodes can be hidden from the "
"editor. This only hides parts of the interface and does not actually remove "
"support for these features, so scenes and scripts relying on those features "
"will still work fine. This also means feature profiles are not an "
"optimization technique. For information on how to optimize Godot see :ref:"
"`doc_performance`."
msgstr ""
"使用功能配置，可以隐藏编辑器中主要功能和节点。这仅隐藏了部分界面，并不会真正"
"移除对这些功能的支持，所以依赖于这些特性的场景和脚本仍然可以正常工作。这同时"
"也意味着，功能配置并不是一种优化技巧。要了解如何对 Godot 进行优化，请参阅 :"
"ref:`doc_performance`。"

msgid "Creating a profile"
msgstr "创建配置"

msgid ""
"To manage editor features go to **Editor > Manage Editor Features**. This "
"will open the **Manage Editor Feature Profiles** window. By default there "
"will be no profile. Click on **Create Profile** and give it a name. You will "
"then see a list of all the features in the Godot editor."
msgstr ""
"要管理编辑器功能，请前往\\ **编辑器 > 管理编辑器功能**\\ 。这样就打开了\\ **"
"管理编辑器功能配置**\\ 窗口。默认是没有配置的。请点击\\ **创建配置文档**\\ 并"
"为其命名。然后你就会看到 Godot 编辑器中所有功能的列表了。"

msgid ""
"The first section allows major editor features to be removed, such as the 3D "
"editor or scripting editor. Below the main features is every class and node "
"in Godot, which can be disabled as well. Click on a node and all of its "
"properties and options will be listed in the **Extra Items** box, these can "
"all be individually disabled."
msgstr ""
"第一个部分可以移除主要的编辑器功能，比如 3D 编辑器或脚本编辑器。主要功能的下"
"方是 Godot 中的所有类，也可以禁用。点击节点后，会在\\ **额外项目**\\ 中列出其"
"属性和选项，可以单独禁用。"

msgid "Sharing a profile"
msgstr "分享配置"

msgid ""
"To share profiles between editors click on the **Export** button. Save the "
"custom profile somewhere as a ``.profile`` file. To use this in another "
"editor open that editor's **Manage Editor Feature Profiles** window and "
"click import, then select the ``.profile`` file."
msgstr ""
"要在编辑器之间分享配置，请点击\\ **导出**\\ 按钮。请将自定义配置保存为 ``."
"profile`` 文件。要在其他编辑器中使用，请打开其\\ **管理编辑器配置**\\ 窗口并"
"点击导入，然后选择该 ``.profile`` 文件。"

msgid ""
"This process is potentially cumbersome however if a large amount of "
"computers need custom profiles. As an alternative, you can enable self-"
"contained mode for Godot, which allows putting all editor configuration in "
"the same folder as the editor binary. See :ref:"
"`doc_data_paths_self_contained_mode` for details."
msgstr ""
"如果大量电脑都需要自定义配置，这个过程可能会比较繁琐。另一种办法是启用 Godot "
"的自包含模式，可以将所有编辑器配置放在与编辑器二进制文件同一文件夹中。详情请"
"参阅 :ref:`doc_data_paths_self_contained_mode`\\ 。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
