"From a high-level, what Godot does is give the user a bunch of parameters "
"that can be optionally set (``AO``, ``SSS_Strength``, ``RIM``, etc.). These "
"parameters correspond to different complex effects (Ambient Occlusion, "
"SubSurface Scattering, Rim Lighting, etc.). When not written to, the code is "
"thrown out before it is compiled and so the shader does not incur the cost "
"of the extra feature. This makes it easy for users to have complex PBR-"
"correct shading, without writing complex shaders. Of course, Godot also "
"allows you to ignore all these parameters and write a fully customized "
"shader."
msgstr ""
"从高级设置开始,Godot所做的是为用户提供一组可选设置的参数(\"环境光遮蔽\" , "
"\"次表面散射强度\" , \"边缘\" 等等)这些参数对应不同的复杂效应(环境遮挡, 次表"

"外特性的成本. 这使得用户很容易拥有复杂的支持PBR着色, 而不需要编写复杂的着色"

"A difference between the vertex function and a fragment function is that the "

"As mentioned in the previous part of this tutorial. The standard use of the "
"fragment function in Godot is to set up different material properties and "
"let Godot handle the rest. In order to provide even more flexibility, Godot "
"also provides things called render modes. Render modes are set at the top of "
"the shader, directly below ``shader_type``, and they specify what sort of "
"functionality you want the built-in aspects of the shader to have."
msgstr ""
"如本教程前一部分所述. 在Godot中, 片段函数的标准用法是设置不同的材质属性, 然后"
"让Godot处理剩下的部分. 为了提供更大的灵活性,Godot还提供了渲染模式. 渲染模式设"

"First let's set the color of the water. We do that by setting ``ALBEDO``."

"The PBR model that Godot uses relies on two main parameters: ``METALLIC`` "
"and ``ROUGHNESS``."
msgstr "PBR模型的Godot用户两个主要参数:\"金属度\" 和 \"粗糙度\"."

msgid ""
"``ROUGHNESS`` specifies how smooth/rough the surface of a material is. A low "

"roughness makes the material appear more solid in color."
msgstr ""
"粗糙度是指材料表面的光滑程度. 低 \"粗糙度\" 会使材料看起来像闪亮的塑料, 而高"
"粗糙度使材料在颜色上看起来更坚实."

msgid ""
"``METALLIC`` specifies how much like a metal the object is. It is better set "
"close to ``0`` or ``1``. Think of ``METALLIC`` as changing the balance "
"between the reflection and the ``ALBEDO`` color. A high ``METALLIC`` almost "
"ignores ``ALBEDO`` altogether, and looks like a mirror of the sky. While a "
"low ``METALLIC`` has a more equal representation of sky color and ``ALBEDO`` "
"color."
msgstr ""

"Water is not a metal, so we will set its ``METALLIC`` property to ``0.0``. "

"to be quite low as well."
msgstr ""
"水不是金属，所以我们将其 ``METALLIC`` 属性设置成 ``0.0``\\ 。水的反射性也很"
"高，因此我们将其``ROUGHNESS`` 属性也设置得非常低。"

msgid ""
"Now we have a smooth plastic looking surface. It is time to think about some "
"particular properties of water that we want to emulate. There are two main "
"ones that will take this from a weird plastic surface to nice stylized "
"water. The first is specular reflections. Specular reflections are those "
"bright spots you see from where the sun reflects directly into your eye. The "
"second is fresnel reflectance. Fresnel reflectance is the property of "
"objects to become more reflective at shallow angles. It is the reason why "
"you can see into water below you, but farther away it reflects the sky."
msgstr ""
"现在，我们有了光滑的塑料外观表面。现在该考虑要模拟的水的某些特定属性了。这里"
"有两种主要的方法可以把诡异的塑料表面变成好看的水。首先是镜面反射"
"（Specular）。镜面反射是那些来自太阳直接反射到你眼里的明亮斑点。第二个是菲涅"
"耳反射（Fresnel）。菲涅尔反射是物体在小角度下更具反射性的属性。这就是为什么你"
"可以看见自己身下的水，却在更远处看见天空倒影的原因。"

msgid ""
"In order to increase the specular reflections, we will do two things. First, "
"we will change the render mode for specular to toon because the toon render "
"mode has larger specular highlights."
msgstr ""
"为了增强镜面反射，我们需要做两件事。首先，由于卡通渲染模式具有更高的镜面反射"
"高光，我们将更改镜面反射为卡通渲染模式。"

msgid ""
"Second we will add rim lighting. Rim lighting increases the effect of light "
"at glancing angles. Usually it is used to emulate the way light passes "
"through fabric on the edges of an object, but we will use it here to help "
"achieve a nice watery effect."
msgstr ""
"其次, 我们将添加边缘照明. 边缘照明增加了掠射角度的光线效果. 通常, 它用于模拟"

"In order to add fresnel reflectance, we will compute a fresnel term in our "
"fragment shader. Here, we aren't going to use a real fresnel term for "
"performance reasons. Instead, we'll approximate it using the dot product of "
"the ``NORMAL`` and ``VIEW`` vectors. The ``NORMAL`` vector points away from "
"the mesh's surface, while the ``VIEW`` vector is the direction between your "
"eye and that point on the surface. The dot product between them is a handy "
"way to tell when you are looking at the surface head-on or at a glancing "
"angle."
msgstr ""
"为了增加菲涅耳反射率，我们将在片段着色器中计算菲涅耳项。在这里，出于性能方面"
"的考虑，我们将不使用真正的菲涅耳术语。取而代之的是，我们将使用 ``NORMAL`` 和 "
"``VIEW`` 向量的点积对其进行近似。\\ ``NORMAL`` 向量指向远离网格物体表面的位"
"置，而 ``VIEW`` 向量则是你的眼睛与该表面上的点之间的方向。它们之间的点积是一"

"And mix it into both ``ROUGHNESS`` and ``ALBEDO``. This is the benefit of "
"ShaderMaterials over StandardMaterial3Ds. With StandardMaterial3D, we could "

"we can set them based on any mathematical function that we can dream up."
msgstr ""
"并将其混合到 ``ROUGHNESS`` 和 ``ALBEDO``\\ 。这是 ShaderMaterial 比 "

"来设置它们。"

msgid ""
"And now, with only 5 lines of code, you can have complex looking water. Now "
"that we have lighting, this water is looking too bright. Let's darken it. "
"This is done easily by decreasing the values of the ``vec3`` we pass into "
"``ALBEDO``. Let's set them to ``vec3(0.01, 0.03, 0.05)``."
