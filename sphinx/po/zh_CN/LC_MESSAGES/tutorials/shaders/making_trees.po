msgid "Making trees"
msgstr "制作树"

msgid ""
"This is a short tutorial on how to make trees and other types of vegetation "
"from scratch."
msgstr "这是一个关于如何从头开始制作树和其他类型植被的小教程."

msgid ""
"The aim is to not focus on the modelling techniques (there are plenty of "
"tutorials about that), but how to make them look good in Godot."
msgstr ""
"我们的目标不是专注于建模技术(关于这方面有很多教程), 而是如何让它们在Godot中看"
"起来更好."

msgid "Start with a tree"
msgstr "从一棵树开始"

msgid "I took this tree from SketchFab:"
msgstr "我从 SketchFab 上获取了这棵树："

msgstr "https://sketchfab.com/models/ea5e6ed7f9d6445ba69589d503e8cebf"

msgid "and opened it in Blender."
msgstr "然后用 Blender 打开。"

msgid "Paint with vertex colors"
msgstr "用顶点颜色绘制"

msgid ""
"The first thing you may want to do is to use the vertex colors to paint how "
"much the tree will sway when there is wind. Just use the vertex color "
"painting tool of your favorite 3D modelling program and paint something like "
"this:"
msgstr ""
"您可能要做的第一件事就是用顶点的颜色来描绘当有风的时候树会摇摆多少. 只需使用"
"您最喜欢的三维建模程序的顶点着色工具, 并绘制如下:"

msgid ""
"This is a bit exaggerated, but the idea is that color indicates how much "
"sway affects every part of the tree. This scale here represents it better:"
msgstr ""
"这有点夸张, 但这个想法是, 颜色表明了多少摇摆影响树的每个部分. 这个比例尺更能"
"说明问题:"

msgid "Write a custom shader for the leaves"
msgstr "为叶子编写自定义着色器"

msgid "This is a simple example of a shader for leaves:"
msgstr "这是一个简单的树叶着色器的示例:"

msgid ""
"This is a spatial shader. There is no front/back culling (so leaves can be "
"seen from both sides), and alpha prepass is used, so there are less depth "
"artifacts that result from using transparency (and leaves cast shadow). "
"Finally, for the sway effect, world coordinates are recommended, so the tree "
"can be duplicated, moved, etc. and it will still work together with other "
"trees."
msgstr ""
"这是一个空间着色器. 没有前/后剔除(所以可以从两边看到叶子), 并且使用了alpha预"
"通道, 所以使用透明度(和叶子投射阴影)导致的深度伪影比较少. 最后, 对于摇摆的效"
"果, 推荐使用世界坐标, 以使树可以被复制, 移动等, 并且仍然可以和其他树一起使用."

msgid ""
"Here, the texture is read, as well as a transmission color, which is used to "
"add some back-lighting to the leaves, simulating subsurface scattering."
msgstr ""
"在这里, 纹理和透射颜色被读取, 透射颜色被用来给叶子添加一些背光, 模拟地下散射."

msgid ""
"This is the code to create the sway of the leaves. It's basic (just uses a "
"sinewave multiplying by the time and axis position, but works well). Notice "
"that the strength is multiplied by the color. Every axis uses a different "
"small near 1.0 multiplication factor so axes don't appear in sync."
msgstr ""
"这是创建叶子摆动的代码. 它是基本的(只是使用正弦波乘以时间和轴的位置, 但工作得"
"很好). 注意, 强度乘以颜色. 每个轴使用不同的小的接近1.0的乘法系数, 所以轴不同"
"步出现."

msgid "Finally, all that's left is the fragment shader:"
msgstr "最后, 剩下的就是片段着色器了:"

msgid "And this is pretty much it."
msgstr "差不多就是这样."

msgid ""
"The trunk shader is similar, except it does not write to the alpha channel "
"(thus no alpha prepass is needed) and does not require transmission to work. "
"Both shaders can be improved by adding normal mapping, AO and other maps."
msgstr ""
"主干着色器是类似的, 除了它不写到alpha通道(因此不需要alpha前置)和不需要传输工"
"作. 这两个着色器都可以通过添加法线映射, AO和其他映射来改进."

msgid "Improving the shader"
msgstr "改进着色器"

msgid ""
"There are many more resources on how to do this that you can read. Now that "
"you know the basics, a recommended read is the chapter from GPU Gems3 about "
"how Crysis does this (focus mostly on the sway code, as many other "
"techniques shown there are obsolete):"
msgstr ""
"还有更多的资源可以做到这一点, 您可以阅读. 现在您已经了解了基础知识, 建议阅读"
"GPU Gems3中关于Crysis如何做到这一点的章节(主要关注摇摆代码, 因为许多其他技术"
"都已经过时了):"
