"Not too bad. If you look around, you can see that the seam has now "
"disappeared, but in its place, we have pinching at the poles. This pinching "
"is due to the way Godot maps textures to spheres in its :ref:"
"`StandardMaterial3D <class_StandardMaterial3D>`. It uses a projection "
"technique called equirectangular projection, which translates a spherical "
"map onto a 2D plane."
msgstr ""
"不算太坏. 如果你环顾四周, 可以看到接缝现在已经消失了, 但在它所处位置, 会有两"
"极的挤压. 这种挤压是由于Godot在其 :ref:`SpatialMaterial "
"<class_SpatialMaterial>` 中把纹理映射到球体的方式造成的. 它使用了一种叫做 "
"\"等角投影\" 的投影技术, 将球面图形转化为一个二维平面."

msgid ""
"If you are interested in a little extra information on the technique, we "
"will be converting from spherical coordinates into Cartesian coordinates. "
"Spherical coordinates map the longitude and latitude of the sphere, while "
"Cartesian coordinates are, for all intents and purposes, a vector from the "
"center of the sphere to the point."
msgstr ""
"如果你对技术方面的一些额外信息感兴趣，我们将从球面坐标转换为直角坐标。球面坐"

msgid ""
"For each pixel, we will calculate its 3D position on the sphere. From that, "
"we will use 3D noise to determine a color value. By calculating the noise in "
"3D, we solve the problem of the pinching at the poles. To understand why, "
"picture the noise being calculated across the surface of the sphere instead "
"of across the 2D plane. When you calculate across the surface of the sphere, "
"you never hit an edge, and hence you never create a seam or a pinch point on "
"the pole. The following code converts the ``UVs`` into Cartesian coordinates."
msgstr ""
"对于每个像素, 我们将计算它在球体上的三维位置. 由此, 我们将使用3D噪波来确定一"

"球体表面而不是在二维平面上计算噪声. 当你跨越球体表面进行计算时, 你永远不会碰"
"到边缘, 因此你永远不会在极点上产生接缝或夹点。下面的代码会将“UV”转换为笛卡尔"
"坐标。"

"To make a gradient in GLSL, we use the ``mix`` function. ``mix`` takes two "

"The first color is blue for the ocean. The second color is a kind of reddish "
"color (because all alien planets need red terrain). And finally, they are "
"mixed together by ``n * 0.5 + 0.5``. ``n`` smoothly varies between ``-1`` "
"and ``1``. So we map it into the ``0-1`` range that ``mix`` expects. Now you "
"can see that the colors change between blue and red."
msgstr ""

"That is a little more blurry than we want. Planets typically have a "

msgid ""
"What ``smoothstep`` does is return ``0`` if the third argument is below the "
"first and ``1`` if the third argument is larger than the second and smoothly "
"blends between ``0`` and ``1`` if the third number is between the first and "
"the second. So in this line, ``smoothstep`` returns ``0`` whenever ``n`` is "
"less than ``-0.1`` and it returns ``1`` whenever ``n`` is above ``0``."
msgstr ""
"``smoothstep`` 所做的是, 如果第三个参数低于第一个参数, 则返回 ``0`` , 如果第"

msgid ""
"One more thing to make this a little more planet-y. The land shouldn't be so "
"blobby; let's make the edges a little rougher. A trick that is often used in "
"shaders to make rough looking terrain with noise is to layer levels of noise "
"over one another at various frequencies. We use one layer to make the "
"overall blobby structure of the continents. Then another layer breaks up the "
"edges a bit, and then another, and so on. What we will do is calculate ``n`` "

"And then, in the material, under the \"Metallic\" section, make sure "
