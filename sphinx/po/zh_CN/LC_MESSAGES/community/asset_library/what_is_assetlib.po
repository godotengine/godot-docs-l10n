"The Godot Asset Library, otherwise known as the AssetLib, is a repository of "
"user-submitted Godot addons, scripts, tools, and other resources, "
"collectively referred to as assets. They're available to all Godot users for "
"download directly from within the engine, but it can also be accessed at "
"Godot's `official website <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_."
msgstr ""
"Godot 资产库，又称 AssetLib，是一个用户提交的 Godot 附加组件、脚本、工具和其"
"他资源的仓库，统称为资产。所有 Godot 用户都可以从引擎中直接下载，也可以从 "
"Godot 的\\ `官方网站 <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_\\ 访问。"

"On the surface, the Asset Library might look and function similar to asset "
"stores available for other engines, such as Unity's Asset Store, or Unreal "
"Engine's Marketplace, where you can submit both freely-available assets, as "
"well as paid, commercial ones. In addition, often times such assets are "
"distributed under non-free, proprietary licenses, limiting what you can do "
"with them."
msgstr ""
"从表面上看，资产库的外观和功能可能类似于其他引擎的资产商店，比如 Unity 的资产"
"商店或者虚幻引擎的市场，在那里你可以提交免费的资产以及付费的商业资产。此外，"
"很多时候，这些资产是在非自由、专有的许可证下发布的，限制了你对它们的使用。"

msgid ""
"The Asset Library is different - all assets are distributed free of charge, "
"and under a host of open-source licenses (such as the MIT license, the GPL, "
"and the Boost Software License). This makes the AssetLib more similar to the "
"software repositories of a Linux distribution."
msgstr ""
"资产库则不同 - 所有资源都是免费分发的，并且服从多种开源许可证（例如 MIT 许可"
"证、GPL 和 Boost 软件许可证）。这使得 AssetLib 更类似于 Linux 发行版的软件仓"
"库。"

msgid ""
"This set of pages will cover how to use the AssetLib (both from inside "
"Godot, and on the website), how you can submit your own assets, and what the "
"guidelines for submission are."
msgstr ""
"接下的内容将介绍如何使用 AssetLib（从 Godot 引擎内部或网站上），如何提交自己"
"的资源，以及提交规范。"

msgid ""
"Please note that the AssetLib is relatively young - it may have various pain "
"points, bugs, and usability issues. As with all Godot projects, the code "
"repository is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-"
"asset-library>`_, where you can submit pull requests and issues, so please "
"do not hesitate to visit it!"
msgstr ""
"请注意，AssetLib还比较年轻--它可能有各种痛点、错误和可用性问题。与所有Godot项"
"目一样，代码库在 `GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-asset-"
"library>`_ 上，你可以在那里提交拉取请求和问题，所以请毫不犹豫地访问它!"

msgid ""
"Be aware that there are, broadly, two different types of assets you can post."
msgstr "要知道, 你可以发布的资源大致有两种不同的类型."

msgid ""
"Assets labeled as \"Templates\", \"Projects\", or \"Demos\" appear under the "
"\"Templates\" tab in the Godot project manager. These assets are standalone "
"Godot projects that can run by themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"screen tab, next to \"2D\", \"3D\", and \"Script\". These assets are meant "
"to be downloaded and placed into an existing Godot project."

"\"Script\" 旁边. 这些资源可以下载并存入现有的Godot项目中."

msgid "Can paid assets be uploaded to the asset library?"
msgstr "收费资源可以上传到资产库吗？"

msgid ""
"Not to the official one, though in the future, there might be other asset "
"libraries which allow it. That said, you are allowed to monetize and sell "
"Godot assets outside the Asset Library."
msgstr ""
"不是对官方的，虽然在未来，可能会有其他资产库允许这样做。也就是说，你可以在资"
"产库以外的地方将 Godot 资产货币化并出售。"
