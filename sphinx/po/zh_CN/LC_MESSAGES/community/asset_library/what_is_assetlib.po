"The Godot Asset Library, otherwise known as the AssetLib, is a repository of "
"user-submitted Godot addons, scripts, tools, and other resources, "
"collectively referred to as assets. They're available to all Godot users for "
"download directly from within the engine, but it can also be accessed at "
"Godot's `official website <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_."
msgstr ""
"Godot 资产库，又称 AssetLib，是一个用户提交的 Godot 附加组件、脚本、工具和其"
"他资源的仓库，统称为资产。所有 Godot 用户都可以从引擎中直接下载，也可以从 "
"Godot 的\\ `官方网站 <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_\\ 访问。"

"On the surface, the Asset Library might look and function similar to asset "
"stores available for other engines, such as Unity's Asset Store, or Unreal "
"Engine's Marketplace, where you can submit both freely-available assets, as "
"well as paid, commercial ones. In addition, often times such assets are "
"distributed under non-free, proprietary licenses, limiting what you can do "
"with them."
msgstr ""
"从表面上看，资产库的外观和功能可能类似于其他引擎的资产商店，比如 Unity 的资产"
"商店或者虚幻引擎的市场，在那里你可以提交免费的资产以及付费的商业资产。此外，"
"很多时候，这些资产是在非自由、专有的许可证下发布的，限制了你对它们的使用。"

"The Asset Library is different - all assets are distributed free of charge, "
"and under a host of open source licenses (such as the MIT license, the GPL, "
"and the Boost Software License). This makes the AssetLib more similar to the "
"software repositories of a Linux distribution."
msgstr ""
"资产库则不同 - 所有资源都是免费分发的，并且服从多种开源许可证（例如 MIT 许可"
"证、GPL 和 Boost 软件许可证）。这使得 AssetLib 更类似于 Linux 发行版的软件仓"
"库。"

msgid ""
"This set of pages will cover how to use the AssetLib (both from inside "
"Godot, and on the website), how you can submit your own assets, and what the "
"guidelines for submission are."
msgstr ""
"接下的内容将介绍如何使用 AssetLib（从 Godot 引擎内部或网站上），如何提交自己"
"的资源，以及提交规范。"

"Please note that the AssetLib is relatively young - it may have various pain "
"points, bugs, and usability issues. As with all Godot projects, the code "
"repository is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-"
"asset-library>`_, where you can submit pull requests and issues, so please "
"do not hesitate to visit it!"
msgstr ""
"请注意，AssetLib还比较年轻--它可能有各种痛点、错误和可用性问题。与所有Godot项"
"目一样，代码库在 `GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-asset-"
"library>`_ 上，你可以在那里提交拉取请求和问题，所以请毫不犹豫地访问它!"
