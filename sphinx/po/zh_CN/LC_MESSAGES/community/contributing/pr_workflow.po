"The so-called \"PR workflow\" used by Godot is common to many projects using "
"Git, and should be familiar to veteran free software contributors. The idea "
"is that only a small number (if any) commit directly to the *master* branch. "
"Instead, contributors *fork* the project (i.e. create a copy of it, which "
"they can modify as they wish), and then use the GitHub interface to request "
"a *pull* from one of their fork's branches to one branch of the original "
"(often named *upstream*) repository."
