"Godot Engine is a non-profit, community-driven free and open source project. "
"Almost all (but our lead dev Juan, more on that below) developers are "
"working *pro bono* on their free time, out of personal interest and for the "
"love of creating a libre engine of exceptional quality."
msgstr ""
"Godot 引擎是一个非盈利、由社区驱动的自由且开源项目。几乎所有的开发人员（不仅"
"包括我们的首席开发人员 Juan， 还有下方更多人员）都在 *无偿* 利用他们的空闲时"
"间，出于个人兴趣以及对创建一个质量卓越的自由引擎的热爱。"

msgid ""
"This means that to thrive, Godot needs as many users as possible to get "
"involved by contributing to the engine. There are many ways to contribute to "
"such a big project, making it possible for everybody to bring something "
"positive to the engine, regardless of their skill set:"
msgstr ""
"这意味着要发展壮大,Godot需要尽可能多的用户通过为引擎做出贡献而参与进来. 有许"
"多方法可以为这样一个大项目做出贡献, 无论他们的技能是什么, 每个人都可以为引擎"
"带来积极的一面:"

msgid ""
"**Be part of the community.** The best way to contribute to Godot and help "
"it become ever better is simply to use the engine and promote it by word-of-"
"mouth, in the credits or splash screen of your games, blog posts, tutorials, "
"videos, demos, gamedev or free software events, support on the Q&A, forums, "
"Contributors Chat, Discord, etc. Participate! Being a user and advocate "
"helps spread the word about our great engine, which has no marketing budget "
"and can therefore only rely on its community to become more mainstream."
msgstr ""
"**成为社区的一份子。**\\ 为 Godot 做贡献并帮助它变得更好的最佳方式，就是使用"
"这个引擎，并且在口头、游戏的致谢或启动界面、博客文章、教程、演示、游戏开发或"
"自由软件活动等场合进行宣传，也可以在问答、论坛、贡献者聊天、Discord 等渠道帮"
"忙回答问题。参与进来！成为用户并宣扬它，有助于宣传我们的强大引擎。它没有营销"
"预算，因此只能依靠社区使其变得更加主流。"

msgid ""
"**Make games.** It's no secret that, to convince new users and especially "
"the industry at large that Godot is a relevant market player, we need great "
"games made with Godot. We know that the engine has a lot of potential, both "
"for 2D and 3D games, but given its young age we still lack big releases that "
"will draw attention to Godot. So keep working on your awesome projects, each "
"new game increases our credibility on the gamedev market!"
msgstr ""
"**制作游戏.** 为了说服新用户, 尤其是整个行业,Godot是相关市场的一个参与者, 我"
"们需要使用Godot制作出色游戏已不是什么秘密. 我们知道该引擎在2D和3D游戏方面具有"
"很大的潜力, 但是鉴于其年轻的年龄, 我们仍然缺乏吸引人们关注Godot的重要发行版"
"本. 因此, 请继续从事出色的项目, 每款新游戏都会提高我们在游戏开发市场上的信"
"誉！"

msgid ""
"**Get involved in the engine's development.** This can be by contributing "
"code via pull requests, testing the development snapshots or directly the "
"git *master* branch, report bugs or suggest enhancements on the issue "
"tracker, improve the official documentation (both the class reference and "
"tutorials) and its translations. The following sections will cover each of "
"those \"direct\" ways of contributing to the engine."
msgstr ""
"**参与引擎的开发.** 这可以通过拉取请求贡献代码, 测试开发快照或直接通过git "
"*master* 分支, 在问题跟踪器上报告bug或建议改进, 改进官方文档(包括类参考和教"
"程)及其翻译. 以下各节将介绍对引擎做贡献的所有这些 \"直接\" 方式."

msgid ""
"**Donate.** Godot is a non-profit project, but it can still benefit from "
"user donations for many things. Apart from usual expenses such as hosting "
"costs or promotional material on events, we also use donation money to "
"acquire hardware when necessary (e.g. we used donation money to buy a "
"MacBook Pro to implement Retina/HiDPI support and various other macOS-"
"related features). Most importantly, we also used donation money to hire "
"core developers so they can work full-time on the engine. Even with a low "
"monthly wage, we need a steady donation income to continue doing this, which "
"has been very beneficial to the project so far. So if you want to donate "
"some money to the project, check `our website <https://godotengine.org/"
"donate>`_ for details."
msgstr ""
"**捐赠.** Godot是一个非盈利项目, 但它可以从用户捐赠中受益. 除了服务器托管费用"
"和活动宣传材料等日常开支外, 我们还会在必要时使用捐款来购买硬件(例如, 使用捐款"
"购买一台Macbook Pro来开发Retina/HiDPI支持, 以及和macOS相关的其他功能). 最重要"
"的是, 我们会使用捐款聘请全职开发引擎的核心开发人员. 即使月薪不高, 我们也需要"
"稳定的捐款收入才能维持, 而目前为止, 全职开发对项目非常有益. 如果您想为该项目"
"捐款, 请访问 `我们的网站 <https://godotengine.org/donate>`_ 了解详细信息."

"project in the form of a patch (a text file describing the changes in a "
"ready-to-apply manner) or - in the modern workflow that we use - via a so-"

msgstr ""
"因此, 每个人都有权修改 `Godot 的源代码 <https://github.com/godotengine/"

msgid "Contributing code changes upstream has two big advantages:"
msgstr "上游贡献代码更改有两大优势:"

msgid ""
"Your own code will be reviewed and improved by other developers, and will be "
"further maintained directly in the upstream project, so you won't have to "
"reapply your own changes every time you move to a newer version. On the "
"other hand it comes with a responsibility, as your changes have to be "
"generic enough to be beneficial to all users, and not just your project; so "
"in some cases it might still be relevant to keep your changes only for your "
"own project, if they are too specific."
msgstr ""
"你自己的代码将由其他开发人员审查和改进, 并将直接在上游项目中进一步维护, 因此"
"你不必在每次迁移到新版本时重新应用自己的更改. 另一方面, 它也是一种责任, 因为"
"你所做的更改必须足够通用才能对所有用户有益, 而不仅仅是对你的项目有益；因此, "
"在某些情况下, 如果更改过于具体, 则仅在你自己的项目中保留可能依然有用."

msgid ""
"The whole community will benefit from your work, and other contributors will "
"behave the same way, contributing code that will be beneficial to you. At "
"the time of this writing, more than 1000 developers have contributed code "

"To ensure good collaboration and overall quality, the Godot developers "
"enforce some rules for code contributions, for example regarding the style "
"to use in the C++ code (indentation, brackets, etc.) or the Git and PR "
"workflow."
msgstr ""
"为了确保良好的合作和整体质量,Godot的开发者对代码贡献实行一些规则, 例如关于C+"

"All pull requests must go through a review process before being accepted. "
"Depending on the scope of the changes, it may take some time for a "
"maintainer responsible for the modified part of the engine to provide their "
"review. We value all of our contributors and ask them to be patient in the "
"meantime, as it is expected that in an open source project like Godot, there "
"is going to be way more contributions than people validating them."
msgstr ""
"所有的拉动请求在被接受之前必须经过一个审查过程。根据修改的范围，负责引擎修改"
"部分的维护者可能需要一些时间来提供他们的审查。我们重视所有的贡献者，并希望他"

msgid ""
"To make sure that your time and efforts aren't wasted, it is recommended to "
"vet the idea first before implementing it and putting it for a review as a "
"PR. To that end, Godot has a `proposal system <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot-proposals>`_. Its usage is encouraged to plan changes and "

msgstr ""
"对引擎做贡献的另一个好方法是测试开发版本或开发分支并报告问题. 报告在稳定版本"

"provenance of your binaries."
msgstr ""
"测试开发分支的“可信”非官方版本；请向社区成员询问可靠的提供商。尽可能使用官方"

msgid ""
"As mentioned previously, it is also helpful to keep your eyes peeled for "

msgid ""
"When you report a bug, you should keep in mind that the process is similar "
"to an appointment with your doctor. You noticed *symptoms* that make you "
"think that something might be wrong (the engine crashes, some features don't "

"**硬件.** 有时错误是特定于硬件的, 即它们仅在某些处理器, 显卡等硬件上发生. 如"
"果可以, 包含有关硬件的信息会很有帮助."

msgid ""
"**Godot version.** This is a must-have. Some issues might be relevant in the "
"current stable release, but fixed in the development branch, or the other "
"way around. You might also be using an obsolete version of Godot and "
"experiencing a known issue fixed in a later version, so knowing this from "
"the start helps to speed up the diagnosis."
msgstr ""
"**Godot 版本。**\\ 这是必要信息。某些问题可能存在于当前稳定版本，但在开发分支"
"中已修复，或者相反。你也可能还在使用过时的 Godot 版本，遇到了在后续版本中已经"

msgid ""
"**How to reproduce the bug.** In the majority of cases, bugs are "
"reproducible, i.e. it is possible to trigger them reliably by following some "
"steps. Please always describe those steps as clearly as possible, so that "
"everyone can try to reproduce the issue and confirm it. Ideally, make a demo "
"project that reproduces this issue out of the box, zip it and attach it to "
"the issue (you can do this by drag and drop). Even if you think that the "
"issue is trivial to reproduce, adding a minimal project that lets everyone "
"reproduce it is a big added value. You have to keep in mind that there are "
"thousands of issues in the tracker, and developers can only dedicate little "
"time to each issue."
msgstr ""
"**如何重现 bug。**\\ 在大多数情况下，bug 是可重现的，即可以通过遵循某些步骤切"
"实地触发它们。请始终尽可能清楚地描述这些步骤，以便每个人都可以尝试重现问题并"
"进行确认。如果条件允许，请制作一个可以立即重现此问题的演示项目，将其压缩并将"
"其附加到问题中（你可以通过拖放操作完成此操作）。即使你认为该问题的重现方法非"
