msgid ""
"As the Godot engine organization on GitHub currently has a restricted number "

"contributors are welcome to take on any issue, if relevant after mentioning "
"it on the issue ticket and/or discussing the best way to resolve it with "
"other developers."
msgstr ""
"由于GitHub上的Godot引擎组织目前的贡献者数量有限, 我们暂时不会广泛使用受托者. "

"*Confirmed*: has been confirmed by at least one other contributor than the "
"bug reporter (typically for *Bug* reports). The purpose of this label is to "
"let developers know which issues are still reproducible when they want to "

"*Confirmed* label may not be relevant anymore."
msgstr ""
"*Confirmed*: 已由至少一个其他贡献者而不是错误报告者(通常用于 *Bug* 报告)确"
"认. 该标签的目的是让开发人员知道当他们想要选择要解决的问题时仍然可以重现的问"
