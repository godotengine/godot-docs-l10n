msgid "Content guidelines"
msgstr "内容规范"

msgid ""
"This document is here to help us assess what we should include in the "
"official documentation. Below, you will find a couple of principles and "
"recommendations to write accessible content."
msgstr ""
"本文档致力于帮助大家评估哪些内容应该加入到官方文档中。你可以在下面找到一些关"
"于如何编写简单易懂的内容的原则和建议。"

msgid "We want to achieve two goals:"
msgstr "我们想实现两个目标："

msgid ""
"**Empathize with our users.** We should write in a way that makes it easy "
"for them to learn from the docs."
msgstr "**与用户共情。**\\ 写作时，应该让通过文档来学习变得简单。"

msgid ""
"**Write a complete reference manual**. Our goal here is not to teach "
"programming foundations. Instead, we should provide a reference for how "
"Godot's features work."
msgstr ""
"**编写完善的参考手册**\\ 。我们这里的目标不是教授编程的基础知识。我们应该提供"
"了解如何使用 Godot 功能的参考材料。"

msgid "Guidelines and principles"
msgstr "规范与原则"

msgid ""
"Below are the guidelines we should strive to follow. They are not hard "
"rules, though: exceptionally, a topic will require breaking one or more of "
"these. Still, we should strive to achieve the two goals listed above."
msgstr ""
"以下是我们应该努力遵守的规范。不过这些并不是硬性规定：特殊情况下，某个主题会"
"需要打破这里的若干规范。不过我们还是应该尽量完成上面所列出的两个目标。"

msgid "Writing complete and accessible documentation"
msgstr "编写完善易懂的文档"

msgid ""
"**A feature doesn't exist unless it is documented**. If a user can't find "
"information about a feature and how it works, it doesn't exist to them. We "
"should ensure that we cover everything Godot does."
msgstr ""
"**功能在编写文档前是不存在的**\\ 。如果用户无法找到某个功能的信息和用法，那么"
"这个功能对于他们就不存在。我们应该保证涉及到 Godot 的方方面面。"

msgid ""
"When adding or updating an engine feature, the documentation team needs to "
"know about it. Contributors should open an issue on the `godot-docs` "
"repository when their work gets merged and requires documentation."
msgstr ""
"添加或更新引擎的功能时，文档团队应该跟进。工作成果被合并后，如果需要文档，贡"
"献者应该在 `godot-docs` 仓库创建 Issue。"

msgid ""
"Do your best to keep documents **under 1000 words in length**. If a page "
"goes past that threshold, consider splitting it into two parts if possible. "
"Limiting page size forces us to write concisely and to break large documents "
"so they each focus on a particular problem."
msgstr ""
"请竭尽所能将文档保持在\\ **1000 个单词以内**\\ 。如果页面超过了这个阈值，如果"
"可能，请考虑将它拆分成两个部分。对页面的大小作出限制，强制我们在写作时保持简"
"洁，将大段的文档进行拆分可以让每一部分都集中于某个特定的问题。"

msgid ""
"Make it clear what **problem** each page or section of a page tackles and "
"what the user will learn from it. Users need to know if they're reading the "
"correct guide to solving problems they encounter. For example, instead of "
"writing the heading \"Signals\", consider writing \"Reacting to changes with "
"signals\". The second title makes it clear what the purpose of signals is."
msgstr ""
"讲清楚每个页面或章节所针对的\\ **问题**\\ ，以及用户会学到什么。用户需要知道"
"他们看的指南是否能够正确解决他们所遇到的问题。例如，请不要在题目里"
"写“Signals”（信号），请考虑写“Reacting to changes with signals”（使用信号对变"
"化作出响应）。后者标明了使用信号的目的。"

msgid ""
"Long section titles lead to long entries in the side menu, which can make "
"navigation cumbersome. Try to keep headings five words long or less."
msgstr ""
"章节标题太长，侧边菜单的项目就会变长，导航也会变得冗长。请尽量让题目保持在五"
"个单词以内。"

msgid ""
"If the page assumes specific knowledge of other Godot features, mention it "
"and link it to the corresponding documentation. For instance, a page about "
"physics may use signals, in which case we could note that the page that "
"introduces signals is a pre-requisite."
msgstr ""
"如果页面中要用到其他 Godot 特性，请进行提及并链接到对应的文档。例如，关于物理"
"的页面可能会用到信号，那么就可以标明介绍信号的页面是该页面的先决条件。"

msgid "Limiting cognitive load"
msgstr "减少认知负担"

msgid ""
"Limit the cognitive load required to read the documentation. The simpler and "
"more explicit language we use, the more efficient it becomes for people to "
"learn. You can do so by:"
msgstr ""
"减少阅读文档的认知负担。我们使用的语言越简单明了，大家学习起来效率就越高。你"
"可以："

msgid "Introducing only one new concept at a time whenever possible."
msgstr "尽可能一次只介绍一个新概念。"

msgid "Using simple English, as we recommend in our writing guidelines."
msgstr "就像在编写规范中推荐的一样，使用简单的英语。"

msgid ""
"Including one or more **concrete usage examples**. Prefer a real-world "
"example to abstract code like ``foobar``."
msgstr ""
"提供若干\\ **实际使用示例**\\ 。现实世界的例子比像 ``foobar`` 一样的抽象代码"
"更好。"

msgid ""
"While many people may understand more complex language and abstract "
"examples, you will lose others. Also, understandable writing and practical "
"examples benefit everyone."
msgstr ""
"虽然很多人能够理解复杂的语言和抽象的例子，你还是会失去其他人。而且，通俗易懂"
"的写作和实际的例子能让所有人都受益。"

msgid ""
"Always make an effort to **put yourself in the user's shoes**. When we "
"understand something thoroughly, it becomes evident to us. We may fail to "
"think about details relevant to a newcomer, but **good documentation meets "
"users where they are**. We should strive to explain each feature's "
"capabilities or intended uses with the most straightforward language "
"possible."
msgstr ""
"始终努力\\ **设身处地为用户着想**\\ 。某件事情如果我们完全理解，对于我们而言"
"就会变得显而易见。我们可能无法想象新手相关的细节，但\\ **好的文档就是要为用户"
"雪中送炭**\\ 。我们应该用尽可能直白的语言，尽力去解释每一个特性的用处或用法。"

msgid ""
"Try to remember what you first needed to know when learning about the "
"feature or concept. What new terms did you need to learn? What confused you? "
"What was the hardest to grasp? You will want users to review your work, and "
"we recommend you practice explaining the feature before writing about it."
msgstr ""
"回想一下学习某个功能或概念时，你首先需要了解的东西。你需要用到哪些新的术语？"
"你困惑的点是什么？最难掌握的是什么？你会希望让用户对你的成果进行评审，我们建"
"议你在着手写作之前，先练习一下如何解释这个功能。"

msgid ""
"Having programming foundations is a pre-requisite to use a complex engine "
"like Godot. Talking about variables, functions, or classes is acceptable. "
"But we should favor plain language over specific terminology like "
"\"metaprogramming\". If you need to use precise terms, be sure to define "
"them."
msgstr ""
"拥有编程基础是使用像 Godot 这样复杂的引擎的先决条件。你可以用到变量、函数、"
"类。不过相对于“元编程”之类的特定术语，我们应该更倾向于使用平实的语言。如果你"
"需要使用精准的术语，请一定要给出定义。"

msgid ""
"When a page assumes knowledge of another engine feature, declare it at the "
"beginning and link to resources that cover what users need. You may also "
"link to other websites for pre-requisites beyond the documentation's scope. "
"For example, you could link to an introduction to programming in the getting "
"started guide, or a website that teaches math theory in the math section."
msgstr ""
"如果某个页面假设读者了解引擎的另一项功能，请在开头给出介绍和能够为用户提供必"
"要信息的资源链接。如果先决条件不在文档的范畴内，你也可以链接到其他网站。例如"
"在数学章节中，你可以链接到入门指南中的编程简介章节，也可以链接到某个教授数学"
"理论的网站。"
