"Bisecting is a way to find regressions in software. After reporting a bug on "
"the `Godot repository on GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`__, "
"you may be asked by a contributor to *bisect* the issue. Bisecting makes it "
"possible for contributors to fix bugs faster, as they can know in advance "
"which commit caused the regression. Your effort will be widely appreciated :)"

"二分查找是在软件中查找回归的一种方法。在 GitHub 上的 `Godot 仓库 <https://"

"做\\ *二分查找*\\ 。二分查找可以让贡献者更快地修复错误，因为他们可以提前知道"

msgid "What is bisecting?"
msgstr "什么是两分法？"

msgid ""
"Godot developers use the `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ version control "
"system. In the context of Git, bisecting is the process of performing a "
"manual `binary search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Binary_search_algorithm>`__ to determine when a regression appeared. While "
"it's typically used for bugs, it can also be used to find other kinds of "
"unexpected changes such as performance regressions."
msgstr ""
"Godot开发人员使用 `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ 版本控制系统. 在Git的上下文"
"中, 二等分是执行手动 `二进制搜索 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Binary_search_algorithm>`__ 的过程, 以确定什么时候出现了回归. 尽管它通常用于"
"错误, 但也可以用于查找其他种类的意外更改, 例如性能下降."

msgid "Using official builds to speed up bisecting"
msgstr "使用官方版本加快平分"

msgid ""
"Before using Git's ``bisect`` command, we strongly recommend trying to "
"reproduce the bug with an older (or newer) official release. This greatly "
"reduces the range of commits that potentially need to be built from source "
"and tested. You can find binaries of official releases, as well as alphas, "
"betas, and release candidates `here <https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/"
"godotengine/>`__."
msgstr ""
"在使用Git的 ``bisect`` 命令之前, 我们强烈建议尝试使用较旧的(或较新的)正式版本"
"重现该错误. 这大大减少了可能需要从源构建和测试的提交范围. 您可以在 `此处 "
"<https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/>`__ 找到官方发行版的二进制文件"
"以及alpha,beta和发行候选文件."

msgid ""
"For example, if you've reported a bug against Godot 3.2, you should first "
"try to reproduce the bug in Godot 3.1 (not a patch release, see below for "
"the reason). If the bug doesn't occur there, try to reproduce it in Godot "
"3.2 *beta 1* (which is roughly in the middle of all test builds available). "
"If you can't reproduce the bug with Godot 3.2 beta 1, then try newer betas "
"and RC builds. If you do manage to reproduce the bug with Godot 3.2 beta 1, "
"then try older alpha builds."
msgstr ""
"例如，如果您报告了 Godot 3.2 中的错误，则应首先尝试在 Godot 3.1 中重现该错误"
"（不是补丁版本，原因见下文）。如果那里没有发生该错误，请尝试在 Godot 3.2 "
"*beta 1* 中重现该错误（大约在所有可用测试版本的中间）。如果您无法使用 Godot "
"3.2 beta 1 重现该错误，请尝试使用较新的 beta 和 RC 版本。如果您用 Godot 3.2 "
"beta 1 重现了该错误，那么就再尝试使用较早的 alpha 版本。"

msgid ""
"For bisecting regressions, don't use patch releases such as Godot 3.1.2. "
"Instead, use the minor version's first release like Godot 3.1. This is "
"because patch releases are built from a separate *stable branch*. This kind "
"of branch doesn't follow the rest of Godot's development, which is done in "
"the ``master`` branch."
msgstr ""
"对于二等分回归, 请勿使用修补程序版本, 例如Godot 3.1.2. 而是使用次要版本的第一"
"个发行版, 例如Godot 3.1. 这是因为修补程序版本是从单独的* stable分支*构建的. "
"这种分支没有遵循Godot的其余开发, 而是在\" master\"分支中完成的."

msgid "The Git bisect command"
msgstr "Git bisect 命令"

msgid ""
"If you've found a build that didn't exhibit the bug in the above testing "
"process, you can now start bisecting the regression. The Git version control "
"system offers a built-in command for this: ``git bisect``. This makes the "
"process semi-automated as you only have to build the engine, run it and try "
"to reproduce the bug."
msgstr ""
"如果您发现在上述测试过程中未显示该错误的构建，则可以立即将回归二等分。Git 版"
"本控制系统为此提供了一个内置命令：\\ ``git bisect``\\ 。这使过程成为半自动化"
"的过程，因为您只需要构建引擎，运行它并尝试重现该错误即可。"

msgid ""
"Before bisecting a regression, you need to set up a build environment to "
"compile Godot from source. To do so, read the :ref:`Compiling <toc-devel-"
"compiling>` page for your target platform. (Compiling Godot from source "
"doesn't require C++ programming knowledge.)"
msgstr ""
"在平分回归之前, 您需要设置一个构建环境以从源代码编译Godot. 为此, 请阅读目标平"
"台的 :ref:`Compiling <toc-devel-compiling>` 页面. (从源代码编译Godot不需要C +"
"+编程知识.)"

msgid ""
"Note that compiling Godot can take a while on slow hardware (up an hour for "
"each full rebuild on a slow dual-core CPU). This means the full process can "
"take up to several hours. If your hardware is too slow, you may want to stop "
"there and report the results of your \"pre-bisecting\" on the GitHub issue "
"so another contributor can continue bisecting from there."
msgstr ""
"请注意, 编译 Godot 可能需要在缓慢的硬件上一段时间(在缓慢的双核 CPU 上, 每次完"
"全重建需要一个小时). 这意味着整个过程最多可能需要几个小时. 如果您的硬件太慢, "
"您可能希望停止并报告 GitHub 问题的 \"预分节\" 结果, 以便其他参与者可以继续从"
"该部分开始参与."

msgid ""
"To start bisecting, you must first determine the commit hashes (identifiers) "
"of the \"bad\" and \"good\" build. \"bad\" refers to the build that exhibits "
"the bug, whereas \"good\" refers to the version that doesn't exhibit the "
"bug. If you're using a pre-release build as the \"good\" or \"bad\" build, "
"browse the `download mirror <https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/"
">`__, go to the folder that contains the pre-release you downloaded and look "
"for the ``README.txt`` file. The commit hash is written inside that file."
msgstr ""
"要开始划分, 你必须首先确定 \"坏\" 和 \"好\" 的版本提交散列值(标识符).\"坏\" "
"指的是表现出错误的版本, 而 \"好\" 指的是没有表现出错误的版本. 如果你使用一个"
"预发布版本作为 \"好\" 或 \"坏\" `下载镜像 <https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/"
"godotengine/>`__, 进入包含你下载的预发布版本的文件夹, 寻找 ``README.txt`` 文"
"件. 提交的哈希值就写在该文件中."

msgid ""
"If you're using a stable release as the \"good\" or \"bad\" build, use one "
"of the following commit hashes depending on the version:"
msgstr "如果您使用稳定版本作为“好”或“坏”版本，请根据版本使用以下提交哈希之一："

msgid ""
"To refer to the latest state of the master branch, you can use ``master`` "

"After entering one of the commands above, Git will switch to a different "

"You'll have to repeat this several times. The longer the commit range, the "
"more steps will be required. 5 to 10 steps are usually sufficient to find "

"the worst case scenario)."
msgstr ""
