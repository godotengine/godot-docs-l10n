"Below are the guidelines we should strive to follow. They are not hard "

"Still, we should strive to achieve the two goals listed above."

"以下是我们应该努力遵守的规范。不过这些并不是硬性规定：特殊情况下，某个主题会"
"需要打破这里的若干规范。不过我们还是应该尽量完成上面所列出的两个目标。"

msgid "Writing complete and accessible documentation"
msgstr "编写完善易懂的文档"

"**A feature doesn't exist unless it is documented**. If a user can't find "
"information about a feature and how it works, it doesn't exist to them. We "
"should ensure that we cover everything Godot does."
msgstr ""
"**功能在编写文档前是不存在的**\\ 。如果用户无法找到某个功能的信息和用法，那么"
"这个功能对于他们就不存在。我们应该保证涉及到 Godot 的方方面面。"

msgid ""
"When adding or updating an engine feature, the documentation team needs to "
"know about it. Contributors should open an issue on the `godot-docs` "
"repository when their work gets merged and requires documentation."

"添加或更新引擎的功能时，文档团队应该跟进。工作成果被合并后，如果需要文档，贡"

"Do your best to keep documents **under 1000 words in length**. If a page "
"goes past that threshold, consider splitting it into two parts. Limiting "
"page size forces us to write concisely and to break up large documents so "
"that each page focuses on a particular problem."
msgstr ""
"请竭尽所能将文档保持在\\ **1000 个单词以内**\\ 。如果页面超过了这个阈值，如果"
"可能，请考虑将它拆分成两个部分。对页面的大小作出限制，强制我们在写作时保持简"
"洁，将大段的文档进行拆分可以让每一部分都集中于某个特定的问题。"

"Each page or section of a page should clearly state what **problem** it "
"tackles and what it will teach the user. Users need to know if they're "
"reading the correct guide for solving the problems they're encountering. For "
"example, instead of writing the heading \"Signals\", consider writing "
"\"Reacting to changes with signals\". The second title makes it clear what "
"the purpose of signals is."
msgstr ""
"讲清楚每个页面或章节所针对的\\ **问题**\\ ，以及用户会学到什么。用户需要知道"
"他们看的指南是否能够正确解决他们所遇到的问题。例如，请不要在题目里"
"写“Signals”（信号），请考虑写“Reacting to changes with signals”（使用信号对变"
"化作出响应）。后者标明了使用信号的目的。"

msgid ""
"Long section titles lead to long entries in the side menu, which can make "
"navigation cumbersome. Try to keep headings five words long or less."
msgstr ""
"章节标题太长，侧边菜单的项目就会变长，导航也会变得冗长。请尽量让题目保持在五"

"If the page assumes specific knowledge of other Godot features, mention it "
"and link to the corresponding documentation. For instance, a page about "
"physics may use signals, in which case you could note that the signals "
"tutorial is a prerequisite. You may also link to other websites for "
"prerequisites beyond the documentation's scope. For example, you could link "
"to an introduction to programming in the getting started guide, or a website "
"that teaches math theory in the math section."
msgstr ""
"如果某个页面假设读者了解引擎的另一项功能，请在开头给出介绍和能够为用户提供必"
"要信息的资源链接。如果先决条件不在文档的范畴内，你也可以链接到其他网站。例如"
"在数学章节中，你可以链接到入门指南中的编程简介章节，也可以链接到某个教授数学"
"理论的网站。"

msgid "Limiting cognitive load"
msgstr "减少认知负担"

"Always make an effort to **put yourself in the user's shoes**. When we "
"understand something thoroughly, it becomes obvious to us. We may fail to "
"think about details relevant to a newcomer, but **good documentation meets "
"users where they are**. We should explain each feature's capabilities or "
"intended uses with the most straightforward language possible."
msgstr ""
"始终努力\\ **设身处地为用户着想**\\ 。某件事情如果我们完全理解，对于我们而言"
"就会变得显而易见。我们可能无法想象新手相关的细节，但\\ **好的文档就是要为用户"
"雪中送炭**\\ 。我们应该用尽可能直白的语言，尽力去解释每一个特性的用处或用法。"

"Try to remember what you first needed to know when learning about the "

"Programming fundamentals are a prerequisite for using a complex engine like "

"\"metaprogramming\". If you need to use precise terms, be sure to define "
"them."
