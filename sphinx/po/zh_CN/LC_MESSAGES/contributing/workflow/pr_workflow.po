"The so-called \"PR workflow\" used by Godot is common to many projects using "
"Git, and should be familiar to veteran free software contributors. The idea "
"is that only a small number (if any) commit directly to the *master* branch. "
"Instead, contributors *fork* the project (i.e. create a copy of it, which "
"they can modify as they wish), and then use the GitHub interface to request "
"a *pull* from one of their fork's branches to one branch of the original "
"(often named *upstream*) repository."
msgstr ""
"Godot 使用的所谓“PR 工作流程”对于许多使用 Git 的项目来说都很常见，并且对于资"
"深自由软件贡献者应该很熟悉。其思想就是只有少数（如果有的话）能直接提交给 "
"*master* 分支。而贡献者 *fork* 项目（即创建它的副本，他们可以按照自己的意愿修"
"改），然后使用 GitHub 的界面从其 fork 的某个分支请求 *pull* 到原始（通常命名"
"为 *upstream*\\ ）仓库的某个分支。"

msgid ""
"The resulting *pull request* (PR) can then be reviewed by other "
"contributors, which might approve it, reject it, or most often request that "
"modifications be done. Once approved, the PR can then be merged by one of "
"the core developers, and its commit(s) will become part of the target branch "
"(usually the *master* branch)."
msgstr ""
"然后, 生成的 *拉取请求* (PR)可以由其他贡献者审查, 可能批准它, 拒绝它, 或者最"
"常要求修改它. 一旦获得批准,PR就可以由其中一个核心开发人员合并, 其提交将成为目"

"basics of the Git command line is *highly* recommended. There exist some "

"habits regarding the Git and PR workflow, and we therefore recommend not to "
"use them. In particular, we advise not to use GitHub's online editor for "
"code contributions (although it's tolerated for small fixes or documentation "
"changes) as it enforces one commit per file and per modification, which "
"quickly leads to PRs with an unreadable Git history (especially after peer "
"review)."
