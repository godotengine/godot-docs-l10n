"When a new class is created and exposed to scripting, the editor's interface "
"will display it with a default icon representing the base class it inherits "
"from. In most cases, it's still recommended to create icons for new classes "
"to improve the user experience."
msgstr ""
"当一个新类被创建并暴露于脚本时, 编辑器的界面将显示一个默认图标, 表示它从中继"
"承的基类. 在大多数情况下, 仍然建议为新类创建图标以改善用户体验."

msgid "Creating icons"
msgstr "创建图标"

msgid ""
"To create new icons, you first need a vector graphics editor installed. For "
"instance, you can use the open source `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`_ "
"editor."
msgstr ""
"要创建新图标，你首先需要安装一个向量图形编辑器。例如，你可以使用开源的 "
"`Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`_ 编辑器。"

msgid "Clone the ``godot`` repository containing all the editor icons:"
msgstr "克隆包含所有编辑器图标的 ``godot`` 资源库:"

msgid ""
"The icons must be created in a vector graphics editor in SVG format. There "
"are two main requirements to follow:"
msgstr "图标必须在向量图形编辑器中以 SVG 格式创建. 要遵循两个主要要求:"

msgid ""
"Icons must be 16×16. In Inkscape, you can configure the document size in "
"**File > Document Properties**."
msgstr ""
"图标必须是16×16. 在Inkscape中, 你可以在 **文件>文档属性** 中配置文档大小."

msgid ""
"Lines should be snapped to pixels whenever possible to remain crisp at lower "
"DPI. You can create a 16×16 grid in Inkscape to make this easier."
msgstr ""
"线条应该尽可能地被捕捉到像素, 以便在较低的DPI下保持清晰, 你可以在Inkscape中创"
"建一个16×16的网格来简化这个过程."

msgid ""
"Once you're satisfied with the icon's design, save the icon in the cloned "
"repository's ``editor/icons`` folder. The icon name should match the "
"intended name in a case-sensitive manner. For example, to create an icon for "
"CPUParticles2D, name the file ``CPUParticles2D.svg``."
msgstr ""
"一旦你对图标的设计感到满意, 就把图标保存在拷贝版本库的 ``editor/icons`` 文件"
"夹中. 图标的名称应该与预期的名称相匹配, 并区分大小写. 例如, 要为"
"CPUParticles2D创建一个图标, 将文件命名为 ``CPUParticles2D.svg`` ."

"If the user has configured their editor to use a light theme, Godot will "

"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/4.0.2-stable/editor/editor_themes."
"cpp#L60-L160>`__. This is to ensure the icon always displays with a "
"sufficient contrast rate. Try to restrict your icon's color palette to "
"colors found in the list above. Otherwise, your icon may become difficult to "
"read on a light background."
msgstr ""
"如果用户将其编辑器配置为使用浅色主题,Godot将根据 `一组预定义的颜色映射 "

"的调色板限制在上面列表中的颜色. 否则, 您的图标在浅色背景下可能会变得难以预览."

msgid "Icon optimization"
msgstr "图标优化"

msgid ""
"Because the editor renders SVGs once at load time, they need to be small in "
"size so they can be efficiently parsed. Editor icons must be first optimized "
"before being added to the engine, to do so:"
msgstr ""
"因为编辑器在加载时只呈现一次SVG, 所以SVG的大小必须很小, 这样才能有效地解析"
"SVG. 在添加到引擎之前, 必须首先优化编辑器图标, 为此:"

"Install `svgcleaner <https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgcleaner>`__ by "

"The ``--multipass`` switch improves compression, so make sure to include it. "
"The optimized icon will be saved to ``svg_optimized.svg``. You can also "
"change the destination parameter to any relative or absolute path you'd like."
msgstr ""
"``--multipass`` 开关可以提高压缩率, 所以一定要包含它. 优化后的图标将被保存为 "
"``svg_optimized.svg`` . 你也可以将目标参数改为相对或绝对路径."

msgid ""
"While this optimization step won't impact the icon's quality noticeably, it "
"will still remove editor-only information such as guides. Therefore, it's "
"recommended to keep the source SVG around if you need to make further "
"changes."
msgstr ""
"虽然这个优化步骤不会对图标的质量产生明显影响, 但还是会删除指南等只属于编辑器"
"的信息. 因此, 如果你需要做进一步的修改, 建议将源SVG保留下来."

msgid "Integrating and sharing the icons"
msgstr "集成和分享图标"

msgid ""
"If you're contributing to the engine itself, you should make a pull request "

"the engine to make it pick up new icons for classes."
msgstr ""
"如果你对引擎本身有贡献, 你应该pull request, 在主仓库的 ``editor/icons`` 中添"
"加优化的图标. 重新编译引擎, 使其获取新的类图标."

msgid ""
"It's also possible to create custom icons within a module. If you're "
"creating your own module and don't plan to integrate it with Godot, you "
"don't need to make a separate pull request for your icons to be available "
"within the editor as they can be self-contained."
msgstr ""
"也可以在模块内创建自定义图标. 如果你要创建自己的模块, 并且不打算将其与Godot集"
"成, 则不需要单独的拉取请求即可在编辑器中使用图标, 因为它们可以独立存在."
