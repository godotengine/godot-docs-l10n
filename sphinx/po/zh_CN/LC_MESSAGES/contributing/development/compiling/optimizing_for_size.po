msgid "Optimizing a build for size"
msgstr "为尺寸优化构建"

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr "依据"

msgid ""
"Sometimes, it is desired to optimize a build for size rather than speed. "
"This means not compiling unused functions from the engine, as well as using "
"specific compiler flags to aid on decreasing build size. Common situations "
"include creating builds for mobile and Web platforms."
msgstr ""
"有时, 需要针对大小而不是速度来优化构建. 这意味着不编译引擎上的未使用的函数, "
"以及使用特定的编译器标志来帮助减小构建大小. 常见情况包括为移动和Web平台创建构"
"建."

msgid ""
"This tutorial aims to give an overview on different methods to create a "
"smaller binary. Before continuing, it is recommended to read the previous "
"tutorials on compiling Godot for each platform."
msgstr ""
"本教程旨在概述创建较小二进制文件的不同方法. 在继续之前, 建议阅读之前有关为每"
"个平台编译Godot的教程."

msgid ""
"The options below are listed from the most important (greatest size savings) "
"to the least important (lowest size savings)."
msgstr ""
"下面的选项按照从最重要（大小节省得最多）到最不重要（大小节省得最少）的顺序排"
"列。"

msgid "Stripping binaries"
msgstr "剥离二进制文件"

msgid "**Space savings:** Very high"
msgstr "**节省空间：**\\ 非常高"

msgid "**Difficulty:** Easy"
msgstr "**难度：**\\ 简单"

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** Yes"
msgstr "**在官方构建中执行：**\\ 是"

msgid ""
"If you build Windows (MinGW), Linux or macOS binaries from source, remember "
"to strip debug symbols from binaries by installing the ``strip`` package "
"from your distribution then running:"
msgstr ""
"如果你从源码构建了 Windows（MinGW）、Linux、macOS 的二进制文件，请记得剥离二"
"进制文件中的调试符号。首先请安装你的发行版中的 ``strip`` 包，然后执行："

msgid "On Windows, ``strip.exe`` is included in most MinGW toolchain setups."
msgstr "在 Windows 上，大多数 MinGW 工具链安装时都会包含 ``strip.exe``\\ 。"

msgid ""
"This will reduce the size of compiled binaries by a factor between 5× and "
"10×. The downside is that crash backtraces will no longer provide accurate "
"information (which is useful for troubleshooting the cause of a crash). :ref:"
"`C++ profilers <doc_using_cpp_profilers>` will also no longer be able to "
"display function names (this does not affect the built-in GDScript profiler)."
msgstr ""
"这样可以将编译后二进制文件减少到原先五分之一到十分之一的大小。缺点是崩溃追踪"
"中就无法再提供准确的信息了（可用于查找崩溃原因）。\\ :ref:`C++ 性能分析器 "
"<doc_using_cpp_profilers>`\\ 也将无法显示函数名称（不影响内置的 GDScript 性能"
"分析器）。"

"The above command will not work on Windows binaries compiled with MSVC and "
"platforms such as Android and Web. Instead, pass ``debug_symbols=no`` on the "
"SCons command line when compiling."
msgstr ""
"上面的命令无法用于使用 MSVC 编译的 Windows 二进制文件，Android 和 HTML5 等平"
"台也一样。作为替代，请在编译时向 SCons 命令行传递 ``debug_symbols=no``\\ 。"

msgid "Compiling with link-time optimization"
msgstr "编译时使用连接时间优化"

msgid "**Space savings:** High"
msgstr "**节省空间：**\\ 高"

msgid ""
"Enabling link-time optimization produces more efficient binaries, both in "
"terms of performance and file size. It works by eliminating duplicate "
"template functions and unused code. It can currently be used with the GCC "
"and MSVC compilers:"
msgstr ""
"启用链接时优化可以在性能和文件大小方面生成更高效的二进制文件. 它通过消除重复"
"的模板功能和未使用的代码来工作. 目前, 它可以与GCC和MSVC编译器一起使用:"

msgid ""
"Linking becomes much slower and more RAM-consuming with this option, so it "
"should be used only for release builds:"
msgstr ""
"使用此选项时，链接会变得特别慢、消耗更多的内存，所以应该仅用于构建发布版本："

msgid ""
"When compiling the ``master`` branch, you need to have at least 8 GB of RAM "
"available for successful linking with LTO enabled."
msgstr ""
"编译 ``master`` 分支时，如果启用了 LTO，那么你需要至少 8 GB 可用内存才能成功"
"链接。"

msgid ""
"When compiling the ``3.x`` branch, you need to have at least 6 GB of RAM "
"available for successful linking with LTO enabled."
msgstr ""
"编译 ``3.x`` 分支时，如果启用了 LTO，那么你需要至少 6 GB 可用内存才能成功链"

"By default, Godot uses an advanced text server with the support for the "
"following features:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Right-to-left typesetting and complex scripts, required to write languages "
"such as Arabic and Hebrew."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides a fallback text server that isn't compiled by default. This "
"text server can be used as a lightweight alternative to the default advanced "
"text server:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you only intend on supporting Latin, Greek and Cyrillic-based languages "
"in your project, the fallback text server should suffice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This fallback text server can also process large amounts of text more "
"quickly than the advanced text server. This makes the fallback text server a "
"good fit for mobile/web projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remember to always pass ``module_text_server_fb_enabled=yes`` when using "
"``module_text_server_adv_enabled=no``. Otherwise, the compiled binary won't "
"contain any text server, which means no text will be displayed at all when "
"running the project."

"For 2D games, having the whole 3D engine available usually makes no sense. "
"Because of this, there is a build flag to disable it:"
msgstr ""
"对于 2D 游戏，拥有整个 3D 引擎通常没有任何意义。因此，有一个构建标志来禁用"
"它："

msgid ""
"Tools must be disabled in order to use this flag, as the editor is not "
"designed to operate without 3D support. Without it, the binary size can be "
"reduced by about 15%."
