"Godot Engine is a non-profit, community-driven free and open source project. "
"Almost all (but our lead dev Juan, more on that below) developers are "
"working *pro bono* on their free time, out of personal interest and for the "
"love of creating a libre engine of exceptional quality."
msgstr ""
"Godot 引擎是一个非盈利、由社区驱动的自由且开源项目。几乎所有的开发人员（不仅"
"包括我们的首席开发人员 Juan， 还有下方更多人员）都在 *无偿* 利用他们的空闲时"
"间，出于个人兴趣以及对创建一个质量卓越的自由引擎的热爱。"

msgid ""
"This means that to thrive, Godot needs as many users as possible to get "
"involved by contributing to the engine. There are many ways to contribute to "
"such a big project, making it possible for everybody to bring something "
"positive to the engine, regardless of their skill set:"
msgstr ""
"这意味着要发展壮大,Godot需要尽可能多的用户通过为引擎做出贡献而参与进来. 有许"
"多方法可以为这样一个大项目做出贡献, 无论他们的技能是什么, 每个人都可以为引擎"
"带来积极的一面:"

msgid ""
"**Be part of the community.** The best way to contribute to Godot and help "
"it become ever better is simply to use the engine and promote it by word-of-"
"mouth, in the credits or splash screen of your games, blog posts, tutorials, "
"videos, demos, gamedev or free software events, support on the Q&A, forums, "
"Contributors Chat, Discord, etc. Participate! Being a user and advocate "
"helps spread the word about our great engine, which has no marketing budget "
"and can therefore only rely on its community to become more mainstream."
msgstr ""
"**成为社区的一份子。**\\ 为 Godot 做贡献并帮助它变得更好的最佳方式，就是使用"
"这个引擎，并且在口头、游戏的致谢或启动界面、博客文章、教程、演示、游戏开发或"
"自由软件活动等场合进行宣传，也可以在问答、论坛、贡献者聊天、Discord 等渠道帮"
"忙回答问题。参与进来！成为用户并宣扬它，有助于宣传我们的强大引擎。它没有营销"
"预算，因此只能依靠社区使其变得更加主流。"

msgid ""
"**Make games.** It's no secret that, to convince new users and especially "
"the industry at large that Godot is a relevant market player, we need great "
"games made with Godot. We know that the engine has a lot of potential, both "
"for 2D and 3D games, but given its young age we still lack big releases that "
"will draw attention to Godot. So keep working on your awesome projects, each "
"new game increases our credibility on the gamedev market!"
msgstr ""
"**制作游戏.** 为了说服新用户, 尤其是整个行业,Godot是相关市场的一个参与者, 我"
"们需要使用Godot制作出色游戏已不是什么秘密. 我们知道该引擎在2D和3D游戏方面具有"
"很大的潜力, 但是鉴于其年轻的年龄, 我们仍然缺乏吸引人们关注Godot的重要发行版"
"本. 因此, 请继续从事出色的项目, 每款新游戏都会提高我们在游戏开发市场上的信"
"誉！"

msgid ""
"**Get involved in the engine's development.** This can be by contributing "
"code via pull requests, testing the development snapshots or directly the "
"git *master* branch, report bugs or suggest enhancements on the issue "
"tracker, improve the official documentation (both the class reference and "
"tutorials) and its translations. The following sections will cover each of "
"those \"direct\" ways of contributing to the engine."
msgstr ""
"**参与引擎的开发.** 这可以通过拉取请求贡献代码, 测试开发快照或直接通过git "
"*master* 分支, 在问题跟踪器上报告bug或建议改进, 改进官方文档(包括类参考和教"

msgid ""
"**Donate.** Godot is a non-profit project, but it can still benefit from "
"user donations for many things. Apart from usual expenses such as hosting "
"costs or promotional material on events, we also use donation money to "
"acquire hardware when necessary (e.g. we used donation money to buy a "
"MacBook Pro to implement Retina/HiDPI support and various other macOS-"
"related features). Most importantly, we also used donation money to hire "
"core developers so they can work full-time on the engine. Even with a low "
"monthly wage, we need a steady donation income to continue doing this, which "
"has been very beneficial to the project so far. So if you want to donate "
"some money to the project, check `our website <https://godotengine.org/"
"donate>`_ for details."
msgstr ""
"**捐赠.** Godot是一个非盈利项目, 但它可以从用户捐赠中受益. 除了服务器托管费用"
"和活动宣传材料等日常开支外, 我们还会在必要时使用捐款来购买硬件(例如, 使用捐款"
"购买一台Macbook Pro来开发Retina/HiDPI支持, 以及和macOS相关的其他功能). 最重要"
"的是, 我们会使用捐款聘请全职开发引擎的核心开发人员. 即使月薪不高, 我们也需要"
"稳定的捐款收入才能维持, 而目前为止, 全职开发对项目非常有益. 如果你想为该项目"

msgid ""
"Your own code will be reviewed and improved by other developers, and will be "
"further maintained directly in the upstream project, so you won't have to "
"reapply your own changes every time you move to a newer version. On the "
"other hand it comes with a responsibility, as your changes have to be "
"generic enough to be beneficial to all users, and not just your project; so "
"in some cases it might still be relevant to keep your changes only for your "
"own project, if they are too specific."
msgstr ""
"你自己的代码将由其他开发人员审查和改进, 并将直接在上游项目中进一步维护, 因此"
"你不必在每次迁移到新版本时重新应用自己的更改. 另一方面, 它也是一种责任, 因为"
"你所做的更改必须足够通用才能对所有用户有益, 而不仅仅是对你的项目有益；因此, "
"在某些情况下, 如果更改过于具体, 则仅在你自己的项目中保留可能依然有用."
