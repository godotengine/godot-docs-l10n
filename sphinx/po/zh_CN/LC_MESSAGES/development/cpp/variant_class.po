msgid "Variant class"
msgstr "Variant 类"

msgid "About"
msgstr "关于"

msgid ""
"Variant is the most important datatype of Godot, it's the most important "
"class in the engine. A Variant takes up only 20 bytes and can store almost "
"any engine datatype inside of it. Variants are rarely used to hold "
"information for long periods of time, instead they are used mainly for "
"communication, editing, serialization and generally moving data around."

"Variant 是 Godot 中最重要的数据类型, 也是引擎中最重要的类.Variant仅占用20个字"
"节, 并且几乎可以在其中存储任何引擎数据类型.Variant 很少用于长时间保存信息, 而"
"主要用于通信, 编辑, 序列化和移动数据."

msgid "A Variant can:"
msgstr "一个Variant可以:"

msgid "Store almost any datatype"
msgstr "存储几乎所有数据类型"

msgid ""
"Perform operations between many variants (GDScript uses Variant as its "
"atomic/native datatype)."
msgstr ""
"在许多Variant对象之间执行操作(GDScript使用Variant作为其原子/原生数据类型)."

msgid "Be hashed, so it can be compared quickly to other variants"
msgstr "被散列, 因此可以快速将其与其他Variant对象进行比较"

msgid "Be used to convert safely between datatypes"
msgstr "用于在数据类型之间安全地转换"

msgid ""
"Be used to abstract calling methods and their arguments (Godot exports all "
"its functions through variants)"
msgstr "用于抽象调用方法及其参数(Godot通过Variant对象导出其所有函数)"

msgid "Be used to defer calls or move data between threads."
msgstr "用于推迟调用或在线程之间交换数据."

msgid "Be serialized as binary and stored to disk, or transferred via network."
msgstr "被序列化为二进制并存储到磁盘, 或通过网络传输."

msgid ""
"Be serialized to text and use it for printing values and editable settings."
msgstr "被序列化为文本, 并将其用于打印值和可编辑的设置."

msgid "Work as an exported property, so the editor can edit it universally."
msgstr "用作导出的属性, 因此编辑器可以对其进行普通地编辑."

msgid "Be used for dictionaries, arrays, parsers, etc."
msgstr "用于字典, 数组, 解析器等."

msgid ""
"Basically, thanks to the Variant class, writing Godot itself was a much, "
"much easier task, as it allows for highly dynamic constructs not common of C+"
"+ with little effort. Become a friend of Variant today."
msgstr ""
"基本上, 由于有了Variant类, 编写Godot本身就容易得多, 因为它可以轻松完成C++不常"
"见的高度动态的结构. 今天就成为Variant的朋友吧."

msgid "Containers: Dictionary and Array"
msgstr "容器：Dictionary 和 Array"

msgid ""
"Both are implemented using variants. A Dictionary can match any datatype "
"used as key to any other datatype. An Array just holds an array of Variants. "
"Of course, a Variant can also hold a Dictionary and an Array inside, making "
"it even more flexible."
msgstr ""
"他们都是使用 Variant 实现的。Dictionary（字典）可以将用作键的任何数据类型与任"
"何其他数据类型进行匹配。Array（数组）包含 Variant 数组。当然，Variant 可以在"
"内部再容纳一个 Dictionary 和一个 Array，从而使其更加灵活。"

"Modifications to a container will modify all references to it. A Mutex "
"should be created to lock it if multi threaded access is desired."

"对容器的修改将修改对该容器的所有引用. 如果需要多线程访问, 则应创建一个互斥锁"
