"From a high-level, what Godot does is give the user a bunch of parameters "
"that can be optionally set (``AO``, ``SSS_Strength``, ``RIM``, etc.). These "
"parameters correspond to different complex effects (Ambient Occlusion, "
"SubSurface Scattering, Rim Lighting, etc.). When not written to, the code is "
"thrown out before it is compiled and so the shader does not incur the cost "
"of the extra feature. This makes it easy for users to have complex PBR-"
"correct shading, without writing complex shaders. Of course, Godot also "
"allows you to ignore all these parameters and write a fully customized "
"shader."

"A difference between the vertex function and a fragment function is that the "

"Now we have a smooth plastic looking surface. It is time to think about some "

"water. The first is specular reflections. Specular reflections are those "
"bright spots you see from where the sun reflects directly into your eye. The "
"second is fresnel reflectance. Fresnel reflectance is the property of "
"objects to become more reflective at shallow angles. It is the reason why "

"Second we will add rim lighting. Rim lighting increases the effect of light "
