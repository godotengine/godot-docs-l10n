"A :ref:`MultiMesh<class_MultiMesh>` is a single draw primitive that can draw "
"up to millions of objects in one go. It's extremely efficient because it "
"uses the GPU hardware to do this (in OpenGL ES 2.0, it's less efficient "
"because there is no hardware support for it, though)."

"The only drawback is that there is no *screen* or *frustum* culling possible "
"for individual instances. This means, that millions of objects will be "
"*always* or *never* drawn, depending on the visibility of the whole "
"MultiMesh. It is possible to provide a custom visibility rect for them, but "
"it will always be *all-or-none* visibility."

"If the objects are simple enough (just a couple of vertices), this is "
"generally not much of a problem as most modern GPUs are optimized for this "
"use case. A workaround is to create several MultiMeshes for different areas "
"of the world."

"It is also possible to execute some logic inside the vertex shader (using "
"the ``INSTANCE_ID`` or ``INSTANCE_CUSTOM`` built-in constants). For an "
"example of animating thousands of objects in a MultiMesh, see the :ref:"
"`Animating thousands of fish <doc_animating_thousands_of_fish>` tutorial. "
"Information to the shader can be provided via textures (there are floating "
"point :ref:`Image<class_Image>` formats which are ideal for this)."

"Another alternative is to use GDNative and C++, which should be extremely "
"efficient (it's possible to set the entire state for all objects using "
"linear memory via the :ref:`VisualServer.multimesh_set_as_bulk_array() "
"<class_VisualServer_method_multimesh_set_as_bulk_array>` function). This "
"way, the array can be created with multiple threads, then set in one call, "
"providing high cache efficiency."

"Finally, it's not required to have all MultiMesh instances visible. The "
"amount of visible ones can be controlled with the :ref:`MultiMesh."
"visible_instance_count <class_MultiMesh_property_visible_instance_count>` "
"property. The typical workflow is to allocate the maximum amount of "
"instances that will be used, then change the amount visible depending on how "
"many are currently needed."
