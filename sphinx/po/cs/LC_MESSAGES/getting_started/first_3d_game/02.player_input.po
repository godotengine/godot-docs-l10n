"In the next two lessons, we will design the player scene, register custom "
"input actions, and code player movement. By the end, you'll have a playable "
"character that moves in eight directions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new scene by going to the Scene menu in the top-left and clicking "
"*New Scene*. Create a *KinematicBody* node as the root and name it *Player*."

msgid ""
"Kinematic bodies are complementary to the area and rigid bodies used in the "
"2D game tutorial. Like rigid bodies, they can move and collide with the "
"environment, but instead of being controlled by the physics engine, you "
"dictate their movement. You will see how we use the node's unique features "
"when we code the jump and squash mechanics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To learn more about the different physics node types, see the :ref:"
"`doc_physics_introduction`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For now, we're going to create a basic rig for our character's 3D model. "
"This will allow us to rotate the model later via code while it plays an "
"animation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a *Spatial* node as a child of *Player* and name it *Pivot*. Then, in "
"the FileSystem dock, expand the ``art/`` folder by double-clicking it and "
"drag and drop ``player.glb`` onto the *Pivot* node."
msgstr ""

"The ``.glb`` files contain 3D scene data based on the open-source GLTF 2.0 "
"specification. They're a modern and powerful alternative to a proprietary "
"format like FBX, which Godot also supports. To produce these files, we "
"designed the model in `Blender 3D <https://www.blender.org/>`__ and exported "
"it to GLTF."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As with all kinds of physics nodes, we need a collision shape for our "
"character to collide with the environment. Select the *Player* node again "
"and add a *CollisionShape*. In the *Inspector*, assign a *SphereShape* to "
"the *Shape* property. The sphere's wireframe appears below the character."

"It will be the shape the physics engine uses to collide with the "
"environment, so we want it to better fit the 3D model. Shrink it a bit by "
"dragging the orange dot in the viewport. My sphere has a radius of about "
"``0.8`` meters."
msgstr ""

"Then, move the shape up so its bottom roughly aligns with the grid's plane."

"With the nodes ready, we can almost get coding. But first, we need to define "
"some input actions."

msgstr "Vytváření vstupních akcí"

msgid ""
"To move the character, we will listen to the player's input, like pressing "
"the arrow keys. In Godot, while we could write all the key bindings in code, "
"there's a powerful system that allows you to assign a label to a set of keys "
"and buttons. This simplifies our scripts and makes them more readable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This system is the Input Map. To access its editor, head to the *Project* "
"menu and select *Project Settings…*."

"Godot projects come with some predefined actions designed for user interface "
