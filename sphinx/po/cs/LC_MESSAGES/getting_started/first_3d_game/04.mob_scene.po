"In this part, you're going to code the monsters, which we'll call mobs. In "
"the next lesson, we'll spawn them randomly around the playable area."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's design the monsters themselves in a new scene. The node structure is "
"going to be similar to the ``player.tscn`` scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a scene with, once again, a :ref:`CharacterBody3D "
"<class_CharacterBody3D>` node as its root. Name it ``Mob``. Add a child "
"node :ref:`Node3D <class_Node3D>`, name it ``Pivot``. And drag and drop the "
"file ``mob.glb`` from the *FileSystem* dock onto the ``Pivot`` to add the "
"monster's 3D model to the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can rename the newly created ``mob`` node into ``Character``."

msgid ""
"We should change its size to fit the 3D model better. You can do so "
"interactively by clicking and dragging on the orange dots."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The box should touch the floor and be a little thinner than the model. "
"Physics engines work in such a way that if the player's sphere touches even "
"the box's corner, a collision will occur. If the box is a little too big "
"compared to the 3D model, you may die at a distance from the monster, and "
"the game will feel unfair to the players."

msgid ""
"Notice that my box is taller than the monster. It is okay in this game "
"because we're looking at the scene from above and using a fixed perspective. "
"Collision shapes don't have to match the model exactly. It's the way the "
"game feels when you test it that should dictate their form and size."
msgstr ""

msgid "Removing monsters off-screen"
msgstr "Odstranění příšer mimo obrazovku"

msgid ""
"We're going to spawn monsters at regular time intervals in the game level. "
"If we're not careful, their count could increase to infinity, and we don't "
"want that. Each mob instance has both a memory and a processing cost, and we "
"don't want to pay for it when the mob is outside the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once a monster leaves the screen, we don't need it anymore, so we should "
"delete it. Godot has a node that detects when objects leave the screen, :ref:"
"`VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D <class_VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D>`, and we're "
"going to use it to destroy our mobs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you keep instancing an object, there's a technique you can use to avoid "
"the cost of creating and destroying instances all the time called pooling. "
"It consists of pre-creating an array of objects and reusing them over and "
"over."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When working with GDScript, you don't need to worry about this. The main "
"reason to use pools is to avoid freezes with garbage-collected languages "
"like C# or Lua. GDScript uses a different technique to manage memory, "
"reference counting, which doesn't have that caveat. You can learn more about "
"that here: :ref:`doc_gdscript_basics_memory_management`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select the ``Mob`` node and add a child node :ref:`VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D "
"<class_VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D>`. Another box, pink this time, appears. "
"When this box completely leaves the screen, the node will emit a signal."

msgid "Coding the mob's movement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's implement the monster's motion. We're going to do this in two steps. "
"First, we'll write a script on the ``Mob`` that defines a function to "
"initialize the monster. We'll then code the randomized spawn mechanism in "
"the ``main.tscn`` scene and call the function from there."
msgstr ""

msgid "Attach a script to the ``Mob``."
msgstr "Ke scéně ``Mob`` přidejte skript."

msgid ""
"Here's the movement code to start with. We define two properties, "
"``min_speed`` and ``max_speed``, to define a random speed range, which we "
"will later use to define ``CharacterBody3D.velocity``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly to the player, we move the mob every frame by calling the function "
"``CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide()``. This time, we don't update the "
"``velocity`` every frame; we want the monster to move at a constant speed "
"and leave the screen, even if it were to hit an obstacle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We need to define another function to calculate the ``CharacterBody3D."
"velocity``. This function will turn the monster towards the player and "
"randomize both its angle of motion and its velocity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function will take a ``start_position``,the mob's spawn position, and "
"the ``player_position`` as its arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We position the mob at ``start_position`` and turn it towards the player "
"using the ``look_at_from_position()`` method, and randomize the angle by "
"rotating a random amount around the Y axis. Below, ``randf_range()`` outputs "
"a random value between ``-PI / 4`` radians and ``PI / 4`` radians."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We got a random position, now we need a ``random_speed``. ``randi_range()`` "
"will be useful as it gives random int values, and we will use ``min_speed`` "
"and ``max_speed``. ``random_speed`` is just an integer, and we just use it "
"to multiply our ``CharacterBody3D.velocity``. After ``random_speed`` is "
"applied, we rotate ``CharacterBody3D.velocity`` Vector3 towards the player."
msgstr ""

msgid "Leaving the screen"
msgstr "Opuštění obrazovky"

msgid ""
"We still have to destroy the mobs when they leave the screen. To do so, "
"we'll connect our :ref:`VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D "
"<class_VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D>` node's ``screen_exited`` signal to the "
"``Mob``."
