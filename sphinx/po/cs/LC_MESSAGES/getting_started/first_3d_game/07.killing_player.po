"We can kill enemies by jumping on them, but the player still can't die. "
"Let's fix this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We want to detect being hit by an enemy differently from squashing them. We "
"want the player to die when they're moving on the floor, but not if they're "
"in the air. We could use vector math to distinguish the two kinds of "
"collisions. Instead, though, we will use an :ref:`Area3D <class_Area3D>` "
"node, which works well for hitboxes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hitbox with the Area node"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Head back to the ``player.tscn`` scene and add a new child node :ref:`Area3D "
"<class_Area3D>`. Name it ``MobDetector`` Add a :ref:`CollisionShape3D "
"<class_CollisionShape3D>` node as a child of it."

"Here is a trick you can use to make the collisions only happen when the "
"player is on the ground or close to it. You can reduce the cylinder's height "
"and move it up to the top of the character. This way, when the player jumps, "
"the shape will be too high up for the enemies to collide with it."

msgid ""
"You also want the cylinder to be wider than the sphere. This way, the player "
"gets hit before colliding and being pushed on top of the monster's collision "
"box."
msgstr ""

msgid "The wider the cylinder, the more easily the player will get killed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, select the ``MobDetector`` node again, and in the *Inspector*, turn "
"**off** its *Monitorable* property. This makes it so other physics nodes "
"cannot detect the area. The complementary *Monitoring* property allows it to "
"detect collisions. Then, remove the *Collision -> Layer* and set the mask to "
"the \"enemies\" layer."

"When areas detect a collision, they emit signals. We're going to connect one "
"to the ``Player`` node. Select ``MobDetector`` and go to *Inspector*'s "
"*Node* tab, double-click the ``body_entered`` signal and connect it to the "
"``Player``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *MobDetector* will emit ``body_entered`` when a :ref:`CharacterBody3D "
"<class_CharacterBody3D>` or a :ref:`RigidBody3D <class_RigidBody3D>` node "
"enters it. As it only masks the \"enemies\" physics layers, it will only "
"detect the ``Mob`` nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Code-wise, we're going to do two things: emit a signal we'll later use to "
"end the game and destroy the player. We can wrap these operations in a "
"``die()`` function that helps us put a descriptive label on the code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Try the game again by pressing :kbd:`F5`. If everything is set up correctly, "
"the character should die when an enemy runs into the collider. Note that "
"without a ``Player``, the following line"
msgstr ""

msgid "gives error because there is no $Player!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also note that the enemy colliding with the player and dying depends on the "
"size and position of the ``Player`` and the ``Mob``\\ 's collision shapes. "
"You may need to move them and resize them to achieve a tight game feel."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ending the game"
msgstr "Ukončení hry"

msgid ""
"We can use the ``Player``\\ 's ``hit`` signal to end the game. All we need "
"to do is connect it to the ``Main`` node and stop the ``MobTimer`` in "
"reaction."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open ``main.tscn``, select the ``Player`` node, and in the *Node* dock, "
"connect its ``hit`` signal to the ``Main`` node."

"You can pat yourself in the back: you prototyped a complete 3D game, even if "
"it's still a bit rough."

"From there, we'll add a score, the option to retry the game, and you'll see "
