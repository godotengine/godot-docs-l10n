msgid "Creating your first script"
msgstr "Vytvoření prvního skriptu"

msgid ""
"In this lesson, you will code your first script to make the Godot icon turn "
"in circles using GDScript. As we mentioned :ref:`in the introduction <toc-"
"learn-introduction>`, we assume you have programming foundations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To learn more about GDScript, its keywords, and its syntax, head to the :ref:"
"`GDScript reference<doc_gdscript>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Project setup"
msgstr "Nastavení projektu"

msgid ""
"Please create a new project to start with a clean slate. Your project should "
"contain one picture: the Godot icon, which we often use for prototyping in "
"the community."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We need to create a Sprite node to display it in the game. In the Scene "
"dock, click the Other Node button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Type \"Sprite\" in the search bar to filter nodes and double-click on Sprite "
"to create the node."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your Scene tab should now only have a Sprite node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Sprite node needs a texture to display. In the Inspector on the right, you "
"can see that the Texture property says \"[empty]\". To display the Godot "
"icon, click and drag the file ``icon.png`` from the FileSystem dock onto the "
"Texture slot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create Sprite nodes automatically by dragging and dropping images on "
"the viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, click and drag the icon in the viewport to center it in the game view."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a new script"
msgstr "Vytvoření nového skriptu"

msgid ""
"To create and attach a new script to our node, right-click on Sprite in the "
"scene dock and select \"Attach Script\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Attach node Script window appears. It allows you to select the script's "
"language and file path, among other options."
msgstr ""
"Otevře se dialogové okno pro vytvoření skriptu. Toto dialogové okno umožňuje "
"nastavit jazyk skriptu, název třídy a další relevantní možnosti."

msgid ""
"Change the Template from Default to Empty to start with a clean file. Leave "
"the other options by default and click the Create button to create the "
"script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Script workspace should appear with your new file open and the following "
"line of code:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every GDScript file is implicitly a class. The ``extends`` keyword defines "
"the class this script inherits or extends. In this case, it's ``Sprite``, "
"meaning our script will get access to all the properties and functions of "
"the Sprite node, including classes it extends, like ``Node2D``, "
"``CanvasItem``, and ``Node``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In GDScript, if you omit the line with the ``extends`` keyword, your class "
"will implicitly extend :ref:`Reference <class_Reference>`, which Godot uses "
"to manage your application's memory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Inherited properties include the ones you can see in the Inspector dock, "
"like our node's ``texture``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the Inspector displays a node's properties in \"Title Case\", "
"with capitalized words separated by a space. In GDScript code, these "
"properties are in \"snake_case\", lowercase, and words separated by an "
"underscore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can hover any property's name in the Inspector to see a description and "
"its identifier in code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello, world!"
msgstr "Ahoj, světe!"

msgid ""
"Our script currently doesn't do anything. Let's make it print the text "
"\"Hello, world!\" to the Output bottom panel to get started."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add the following code to your script:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's break it down. The ``func`` keyword defines a new function named "
"``_init``. This is a special name for our class's constructor. The engine "
"calls ``_init()`` on every object or node upon creating it in memory, if you "
"define this function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDScript is an indent-based language. The tab at the start of the line that "
"says ``print()`` is necessary for the code to work. If you omit it or don't "
"indent a line correctly, the editor will highlight it in red and display the "
"following error message: \"Unexpected indentation.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save the scene if you haven't already, then press :kbd:`F6` to run it. Look "
"at the Output bottom panel that expands. It should display \"Hello, world!\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Delete the ``_init()`` function, so you're only left with the line ``extends "
"Sprite``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Turning around"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's time to make our node move and rotate. To do so, we're going to add two "
"member variables to our script: the movement speed in pixels per second and "
"the angular speed in radians per second."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Member variables sit at the top of the script, before functions. Every node "
"instance with this script attached to it will have its own copy of the "
"``speed`` and ``angular_speed`` properties."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As in some other engines, angles in Godot work in radians by default, but "
"you have built-in functions and properties available if you prefer to "
"calculate angles in degrees instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To move our icon, we need to update its position and rotation every frame in "
"the game loop. We can use the ``_process()`` virtual function of the "
"``Node`` class. If you define it in any class that extends the Node class, "
"like Sprite, Godot will call the function every frame and pass it an "
"argument named ``delta``, the time elapsed since the last frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Games work by rendering many images per second, each called a frame, and "
"they do so in a loop. We measure the rate at which a game produces images in "
"Frames Per Second (FPS). Most games aim for 60 FPS, although you might find "
"figures like 30 FPS on slower mobile devices or 90 to 240 for virtual "
"reality games."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The engine and game developers do their best to update the game world and "
"render images at a constant time interval, but there are always small "
"variations in frame render times. That's why the engine provides us with "
"this delta time value, making our motion independent of our framerate."
msgstr ""

msgid "At the bottom of the script, define the function:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``func`` keyword defines a new function. After it, we have to write the "
"function's name and arguments it takes in parentheses. A colon ends the "
"definition, and the indented blocks that follow are the function's content "
"or instructions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice how ``_process()``, like ``_init()``, starts with a leading "
"underscore. By convention, Godot's virtual functions, that is to say, built-"
"in functions you can override to communicate with the engine, start with an "
"underscore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The line inside the function, ``rotation += angular_speed * delta``, "
"increments our sprite's rotation every frame. Here, ``rotation`` is a "
"property inherited from the class ``Node2D``, which ``Sprite`` extends. It "
"controls the rotation of our node and works with radians."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the code editor, you can ctrl-click on any built-in property or function "
"like ``position``, ``rotation``, or ``_process`` to open the corresponding "
"documentation in a new tab."
msgstr ""

msgid "Run the scene to see the Godot icon turn in-place."
msgstr ""

msgid "Moving forward"
msgstr "Pohyb vpřed"

msgid ""
"Let's now make the node move. Add the following two lines to the "
"``_process()`` function, ensuring the new lines are indented the same way as "
"the one before them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As we already saw, the ``var`` keyword defines a new variable. If you put it "
"at the top of the script, it defines a property of the class. Inside a "
"function, it defines a local variable: it only exists within the function's "
"scope."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We define a local variable named ``velocity``, a 2D vector representing both "
"a direction and a speed. To make the node move forward, we start from the "
"Vector2 class's constant Vector2.UP, a vector pointing up, and rotate it by "
"calling the ``Vector2.rotated()`` method. This expression, ``Vector2.UP."
"rotated(rotation)``, is a vector pointing forward relative to our icon. "
"Multiplied by our ``speed`` property, it gives us a velocity we can use to "
"move the node forward."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We add ``velocity * delta`` to the node's ``position`` to move it. The "
"position itself is of type :ref:`Vector2 <class_Vector2>`, a built-in type "
"in Godot representing a 2D vector."
msgstr ""

msgid "Run the scene to see the Godot head run in circles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Moving a node like that does not take into account colliding with walls or "
"the floor. In :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game`, you will learn another approach "
"to moving objects while detecting collisions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our node currently moves by itself. In the next part, we'll use player input "
"to control it."
msgstr ""
