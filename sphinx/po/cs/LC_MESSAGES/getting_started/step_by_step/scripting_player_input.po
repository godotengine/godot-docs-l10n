msgid "Listening to player input"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Building upon the previous lesson, :ref:`doc_scripting_first_script`, let's "
"look at another important feature of any game: giving control to the player. "
"To add this, we need to modify our ``sprite_2d.gd`` code."
msgstr ""

msgid "You have two main tools to process the player's input in Godot:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The built-in input callbacks, mainly ``_unhandled_input()``. Like "
"``_process()``, it's a built-in virtual function that Godot calls every time "
"the player presses a key. It's the tool you want to use to react to events "
"that don't happen every frame, like pressing :kbd:`Space` to jump. To learn "
"more about input callbacks, see :ref:`doc_inputevent`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Input`` singleton. A singleton is a globally accessible object. Godot "
"provides access to several in scripts. It's the right tool to check for "
"input every frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We're going to use the ``Input`` singleton here as we need to know if the "
"player wants to turn or move every frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For turning, we should use a new variable: ``direction``. In our "
"``_process()`` function, replace the ``rotation += angular_speed * delta`` "
"line with the code below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our ``direction`` local variable is a multiplier representing the direction "
"in which the player wants to turn. A value of ``0`` means the player isn't "
"pressing the left or the right arrow key. A value of ``1`` means the player "
"wants to turn right, and ``-1`` means they want to turn left."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To produce these values, we introduce conditions and the use of ``Input``. A "
"condition starts with the ``if`` keyword in GDScript and ends with a colon. "
"The condition is the expression between the keyword and the end of the line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check if a key was pressed this frame, we call ``Input."
"is_action_pressed()``. The method takes a text string representing an input "
"action and returns ``true`` if the action is pressed, ``false`` otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The two actions we use above, \"ui_left\" and \"ui_right\", are predefined "
"in every Godot project. They respectively trigger when the player presses "
"the left and right arrows on the keyboard or left and right on a gamepad's D-"
"pad."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can see and edit input actions in your project by going to Project -> "
"Project Settings and clicking on the Input Map tab."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, we use the ``direction`` as a multiplier when we update the node's "
"``rotation``: ``rotation += angular_speed * direction * delta``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you run the scene with this code, the icon should rotate when you press :"
"kbd:`Left` and :kbd:`Right`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Moving when pressing \"up\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To only move when pressing a key, we need to modify the code that calculates "
"the velocity. Replace the line starting with ``var velocity`` with the code "
"below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We initialize the ``velocity`` with a value of ``Vector2.ZERO``, another "
"constant of the built-in ``Vector`` type representing a 2D vector of length "
"0."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the player presses the \"ui_up\" action, we then update the velocity's "
"value, causing the sprite to move forward."
msgstr ""

msgid "Complete script"
msgstr "Kompletní skript"

msgid "Here is the complete ``sprite_2d.gd`` file for reference."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you run the scene, you should now be able to rotate with the left and "
"right arrow keys and move forward by pressing :kbd:`Up`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "Shrnutí"

msgid ""
"In summary, every script in Godot represents a class and extends one of the "
"engine's built-in classes. The node types your classes inherit from give you "
"access to properties, such as ``rotation`` and ``position`` in our sprite's "
"case. You also inherit many functions, which we didn't get to use in this "
"example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In GDScript, the variables you put at the top of the file are your class's "
"properties, also called member variables. Besides variables, you can define "
"functions, which, for the most part, will be your classes' methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides several virtual functions you can define to connect your "
"class with the engine. These include ``_process()``, to apply changes to the "
"node every frame, and ``_unhandled_input()``, to receive input events like "
"key and button presses from the users. There are quite a few more."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Input`` singleton allows you to react to the players' input anywhere "
"in your code. In particular, you'll get to use it in the ``_process()`` loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the next lesson, :ref:`doc_signals`, we'll build upon the relationship "
"between scripts and nodes by having our nodes trigger code in scripts."
msgstr ""
