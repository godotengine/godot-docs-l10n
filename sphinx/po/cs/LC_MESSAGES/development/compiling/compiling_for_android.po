"This page describes how to compile Android export template binaries from "
"source. If you're looking to export your project to Android instead, read :"
"ref:`doc_exporting_for_android`."

msgid "Note"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases, using the built-in deployer and export templates is good "
"enough. Compiling the Android APK manually is mostly useful for custom "
"builds or custom packages for the deployer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, you still need to follow the steps mentioned in the :ref:"
"`doc_exporting_for_android` tutorial before attempting to build a custom "
"export template."

msgid "Requirements"
msgstr "Nároky"

msgid "For compiling under Windows, Linux or macOS, the following is required:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`Python 3.5+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "`SCons 3.0+ <https://scons.org/pages/download.html>`_ build system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Android SDK <https://developer.android.com/studio/#command-tools>`_ "
"(command-line tools are sufficient)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Required SDK components will be automatically installed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Linux, **do not use an Android SDK provided by your distribution's "
"repositories as it will often be outdated**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Gradle (will be downloaded and installed automatically if missing)."
msgstr ""

msgid "JDK 11 (either OpenJDK or Oracle JDK)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can download a build from `ojdkbuild <https://github.com/ojdkbuild/"
"ojdkbuild>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get the Godot source code for compiling, see :ref:`doc_getting_source`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a general overview of SCons usage for Godot, see :ref:"
"`doc_introduction_to_the_buildsystem`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting up the buildsystem"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the environment variable ``ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`` to point to the Android "
"SDK. If you downloaded the Android command-line tools, this would be the "
"folder where you extracted the contents of the ZIP archive."
msgstr ""

msgid "Install the necessary SDK components in this folder:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Accept the SDK component licenses by running the following command where "
"``android_sdk_path`` is the path to the Android SDK, then answering all the "
"prompts with ``y``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Complete setup by running the following command where ``android_sdk_path`` "
"is the path to the Android SDK."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To set the environment variable on Windows, press :kbd:`Windows + R`, type "
"\"control system\", then click on **Advanced system settings** in the left "
"pane, then click on **Environment variables** on the window that appears."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To set the environment variable on Linux or macOS, use ``export "
"ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/android-sdk`` where ``/path/to/android-sdk`` "
"points to the root of the SDK directories."
msgstr ""

msgid "Building the export templates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot needs two export templates for Android: the optimized \"release\" "
"template (``android_release.apk``) and the debug template (``android_debug."
"apk``). As Google will require all APKs to include ARMv8 (64-bit) libraries "
"starting from August 2019, the commands below will build an APK containing "
"both ARMv7 and ARMv8 libraries."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compiling the standard export templates is done by calling SCons from the "
"Godot root directory with the following arguments:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Release template (used when exporting with **Debugging Enabled** unchecked)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The resulting APK will be located at ``bin/android_release.apk``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Debug template (used when exporting with **Debugging Enabled** checked)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The resulting APK will be located at ``bin/android_debug.apk``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding support for x86 devices"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you also want to include support for x86 and x86-64 devices, run the "
"SCons command a third and fourth time with the ``android_arch=x86``, and "
"``android_arch=x86_64`` arguments before building the APK with Gradle. For "
"example, for the release template:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will create a fat binary that works on all platforms. The final APK "
"size of exported projects will depend on the platforms you choose to support "
"when exporting; in other words, unused platforms will be removed from the "
"APK."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cleaning the generated export templates"
msgstr "Čištění vygenerovaných šablon exportu"

msgid ""
"You can use the following commands to remove the generated export templates:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the export templates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot needs release and debug APKs that were compiled against the same "
"version/commit as the editor. If you are using official binaries for the "
"editor, make sure to install the matching export templates, or build your "
"own from the same version."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When exporting your game, Godot opens the APK, changes a few things inside "
"and adds your files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing the templates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The newly-compiled templates (``android_debug.apk`` and ``android_release."
"apk``) must be copied to Godot's templates folder with their respective "
"names. The templates folder can be located in:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Windows: ``%APPDATA%\\Godot\\templates\\<version>\\``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Linux: ``$HOME/.local/share/godot/templates/<version>/``"
msgstr ""

msgid "macOS: ``$HOME/Library/Application Support/Godot/templates/<version>/``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``<version>`` is of the form ``major.minor[.patch].status`` using values "
"from ``version.py`` in your Godot source repository (e.g. ``3.0.5.stable`` "
"or ``3.1.dev``). You also need to write this same version string to a "
"``version.txt`` file located next to your export templates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, if you are writing your custom modules or custom C++ code, you "
"might instead want to configure your APKs as custom export templates here:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You don't even need to copy them, you can just reference the resulting file "
"in the ``bin\\`` directory of your Godot source folder, so that the next "
"time you build you will automatically have the custom templates referenced."
msgstr ""

msgid "Troubleshooting"
msgstr "Odstraňování problémů"

msgid "Platform doesn't appear in SCons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Double-check that you've set the ``ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`` environment variable. "
"This is required for the platform to appear in SCons' list of detected "
"platforms. See :ref:`Setting up the buildsystem "
"<doc_android_setting_up_the_buildsystem>` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Application not installed"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Android might complain the application is not correctly installed. If so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Check that the debug keystore is properly generated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check that the jarsigner executable is from JDK 8."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If it still fails, open a command line and run `logcat <https://developer."
"android.com/studio/command-line/logcat>`_:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then check the output while the application is installed; the error message "
"should be presented there. Seek assistance if you can't figure it out."
msgstr ""

msgid "Application exits immediately"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the application runs but exits immediately, this might be due to one of "
"the following reasons:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure to use export templates that match your editor version; if you use "
"a new Godot version, you *have* to update the templates too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``libgodot_android.so`` is not in ``libs/<android_arch>/`` where "
"``<android_arch>`` is the device's architecture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The device's architecture does not match the exported one(s). Make sure your "
"templates were built for that device's architecture, and that the export "
"settings included support for that architecture."
msgstr ""

msgid "In any case, ``adb logcat`` should also show the cause of the error."
