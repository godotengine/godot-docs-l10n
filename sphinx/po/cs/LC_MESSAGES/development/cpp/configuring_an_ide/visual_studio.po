"Visual Studio requires a solution file to work on a project. While Godot "

"Visual Studio features a powerful debugger. This allows the user to examine "
"Godot's source code, stop at specific points in the code, inspect the "
"current execution context, and make live changes to the codebase."

msgid ""
"You can launch the project with the debugger attached using the **Debug > "
"Start Debugging** option from the top menu. However, unless you want to "
"debug the project manager specifically, you'd need to configure debugging "
"options first. This is due to the fact that when the Godot project manager "
"opens a project, the initial process is terminated and the debugger gets "
"detached."

"To configure the launch options to use with the debugger use **Project > "
"Properties** from the top menu:"

"Open the **Debugging** section and under **Command Arguments** add two new "
"arguments: the ``-e`` flag opens the editor instead of the project manager, "
"and the ``--path`` argument tells the executable to open the specified "
"project (must be provided as an *absolute* path to the project root, not the "
"``project.godot`` file)."
