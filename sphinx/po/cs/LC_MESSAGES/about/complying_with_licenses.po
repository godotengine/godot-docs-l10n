"Godot is created and distributed under the `MIT License <https://opensource."

"contributor that submits code to the project does it under this same license "
"and keeps ownership of the contribution."

"The license is the legal requirement for you (or your company) to use and "
"distribute the software (and derivative projects, including games made with "
"it). Your game or project can have a different license, but it still needs "
"to comply with the original one."

"are interested in licence compliance as a contributor, you can find "
"guidelines :ref:`here "
