msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Úvod"

msgid ""
"Every beginner has been there: \"How do I move my character?\" Depending on "
"the style of game you're making, you may have special requirements, but in "
"general the movement in most 2D games is based on a small number of designs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We'll use :ref:`KinematicBody2D <class_KinematicBody2D>` for these examples, "
"but the principles will apply to other node types (Area2D, RigidBody2D) as "
"well."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setup"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each example below uses the same scene setup. Start with a "
"``KinematicBody2D`` with two children: ``Sprite`` and ``CollisionShape2D``. "
"You can use the Godot icon (\"icon.png\") for the Sprite's texture or use "
"any other 2D image you have."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open ``Project -> Project Settings`` and select the \"Input Map\" tab. Add "
"the following input actions (see :ref:`InputEvent <doc_inputevent>` for "
"details):"
msgstr ""

msgid "8-way movement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this scenario, you want the user to press the four directional keys (up/"
"left/down/right or W/A/S/D) and move in the selected direction. The name \"8-"
"way movement\" comes from the fact that the player can move diagonally by "
"pressing two keys at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add a script to the kinematic body and add the following code:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the ``get_input()`` function, we check for the four key events and sum "
"them up to get the velocity vector. This has the benefit of making two "
"opposite keys cancel each other out, but will also result in diagonal "
"movement being faster due to the two directions being added together."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can prevent that if we *normalize* the velocity, which means we set its "
"*length* to ``1``, and multiply by the desired speed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you've never used vector math before, or need a refresher, you can see an "
"explanation of vector usage in Godot at :ref:`doc_vector_math`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the code above does nothing when you press the keys, double-check that "
"you've set up input actions correctly as described in the :ref:"
"`doc_2d_movement_setup` part of this tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rotation + movement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This type of movement is sometimes called \"Asteroids-style\" because it "
"resembles how that classic arcade game worked. Pressing left/right rotates "
"the character, while up/down moves it forward or backward in whatever "
"direction it's facing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here we've added two new variables to track our rotation direction and "
"speed. Again, pressing both keys at once will cancel out and result in no "
"rotation. The rotation is applied directly to the body's ``rotation`` "
"property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To set the velocity, we use the ``Vector2.rotated()`` method, so that it "
"points in the same direction as the body. ``rotated()`` is a useful vector "
"function that you can use in many circumstances where you would otherwise "
"need to apply trigonometric functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rotation + movement (mouse)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This style of movement is a variation of the previous one. This time, the "
"direction is set by the mouse position instead of the keyboard. The "
"character will always \"look at\" the mouse pointer. The forward/back inputs "
"remain the same, however."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here we're using the :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` ``look_at()`` method to "
"point the player towards a given position. Without this function, you could "
"get the same effect by setting the angle like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Click-and-move"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This last example uses only the mouse to control the character. Clicking on "
"the screen will cause the player to move to the target location."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note the ``distance_to()`` check we make prior to movement. Without this "
"test, the body would \"jitter\" upon reaching the target position, as it "
"moves slightly past the position and tries to move back, only to move too "
"far and repeat."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Uncommenting the ``look_at()`` line will also turn the body to point in its "
"direction of motion if you prefer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This technique can also be used as the basis of a \"following\" character. "
"The ``target`` position can be that of any object you want to move to."
msgstr ""

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "Shrnutí"

msgid ""
"You may find these code samples useful as starting points for your own "
"projects. Feel free to use them and experiment with them to see what you can "
"make."
