msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Úvod"

msgid ""
"This tutorial explains how the 2D lighting works in the `lights and shadows "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/2d/"
"lights_and_shadows>`_ demo project. It begins with a brief description of "
"the resources used in the final demo and then describes how to make a scene "
"like the demo step by step."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All the resources for this tutorial can be found in the `official demo "
"repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects>`_ on GitHub. "
"I suggest you download it before starting. Alternatively, it can be "
"downloaded from the Project Manager. Launch Godot and in the top bar select "
"\"Templates\" and search for \"2D Lights and Shadows Demo\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setup"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For this demo we use four textures: two for the lights, one for the shadow "
"casters, and one for the background. I've included links to them all here if "
"you want to download them separately from the demo."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first is the background image (`background.png <https://raw."
"githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/master/2d/"
"lights_and_shadows/background.png>`_) used in the demo. You do not "
"necessarily need a background, but we use one for the demo."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second is a plain black image (`caster.png <https://raw."
"githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/master/2d/"
"lights_and_shadows/caster.png>`_) to use as our shadow caster object. For a "
"top down game this could be a wall or any other object that casts a shadow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next is the light itself (`light.png <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/"
"godotengine/godot-demo-projects/master/2d/lights_and_shadows/light.png>`_). "
"If you click the link you will notice how large it is. The image you use for "
"a light should cover the area you want your light to cover. This image is "
"1024x1024 pixels, so you should use it to cover 1024x1024 pixels in your "
"game."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Lastly, we have the spotlight image (`spot.png <https://raw."
"githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/master/2d/"
"lights_and_shadows/spot.png>`_). The demo uses a blob to show where the "
"light is and the larger light image to show the effect of the light upon the "
"rest of the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nodes"
msgstr "Uzly"

msgid "The demo uses four different nodes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`CanvasModulate <class_CanvasModulate>`"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>`"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`Light2D <class_Light2D>`"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`LightOccluder2D <class_LightOccluder2D>`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`CanvasModulate<class_CanvasModulate>` is used to darken the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Sprites <class_Sprite>` are used to display the textures for the light "
"blobs, the background, and for the shadow casters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Light2Ds <class_Light2D>` are used to light the scene. The way a light "
"typically works is by adding a selected texture over the rest of the scene "
"to simulate lighting. But it can be used in other ways, for example masking "
"out parts of the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`LightOccluder2Ds <class_LightOccluder2D>` are used to tell the shader "
"which parts of the scene cast shadows. The shadows appear only on areas "
"covered by the :ref:`Light2D <class_Light2D>` and their direction is based "
"on the center of the :ref:`Light <class_Light2D>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lights"
msgstr "Světla"

msgid ""
":ref:`Lights <class_Light2D>` cover the entire extent of their respective "
"Texture. They use additive blending to add the color of their texture to the "
"scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Lights <class_Light2D>` have four ``Modes``: ``Add``, ``Sub``, "
"``Mix``, and ``Mask``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Add`` adds the color of the light texture to the scene. It brightens the "
"area under the light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Sub`` subtracts the color of the light from the scene. It darkens the area "
"under the light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Mix`` mixes the color of the light with the underlying scene. The "
"resulting brightness is halfway between the color of the light and the color "
"underneath."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Mask`` is used to mask out areas that are covered by the light. Masked out "
"areas are hidden or revealed based on the color of the light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the demo the lights have two components, the :ref:`Light "
"<class_Light2D>` itself (which is the effect of the light), and a :ref:"
"`Sprite <class_Sprite>` blob which is an image showing the location of the "
"light source. A child :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` is not necessary to make "
"a :ref:`Light <class_Light2D>` work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shadows"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shadows are made by intersecting a :ref:`Light <class_Light2D>` with a :ref:"
"`LightOccluder2D <class_LightOccluder2D>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default shadows are turned off. To turn them on click on the :ref:`Light "
"<class_Light2D>` and under the Shadows section check ``Enabled``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the demo we are using a :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` with a Texture on it "
"to make the \"Shadow Casters\", but in reality all you need is a couple of :"
"ref:`LightOccluder2Ds <class_LightOccluder2D>`. By itself the :ref:"
"`LightOccluder2D <class_LightOccluder2D>` looks like a dark spot and in this "
"demo the :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` is just a black square."
msgstr ""

msgid "Step by step"
msgstr "Krok za krokem"

msgid ""
"Now that we have covered the basics of the nodes being used, we can now walk "
"step by step through the process of making a scene like the one found in the "
"demo."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First add a :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` and set its texture to the "
"`background image <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-demo-"
"projects/master/2d/lights_and_shadows/background.png>`_. For your game this "
"can be any background you choose. For this style of shadow it is most likely "
"to be a floor texture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next create three :ref:`Light2D's <class_Light2D>` and set their textures to "
"the `light image <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-demo-"
"projects/master/2d/lights_and_shadows/light.png>`_. You can alter their "
"color in the top section. By default shadows are turned off and the ``mode`` "
"is set to ``add``. This means that each light adds its own color to whatever "
"is underneath."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next add a child :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` to each of the :ref:`Light "
"<class_Light2D>` nodes, and set the :ref:`Sprite's <class_Sprite>` texture "
"to the `blob image <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-demo-"
"projects/master/2d/lights_and_shadows/spot.png>`_. Each of these should stay "
"centered on the :ref:`Light <class_Light2D>` node. The blob is the image of "
"the light itself while the :ref:`Light <class_Light2D>` shows the effect "
"that the light has on the scene. The :ref:`LightOccluder2D's "
"<class_LightOccluder2D>` will treat the position of the light as the center "
"of the :ref:`Light <class_Light2D>` node, which is why we want the blob to "
"be centered on its parent :ref:`Light <class_Light2D>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The animations in the demo will not be covered here. See :ref:"
"`doc_introduction_animation` for information on creating animations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Right now the scene should look too bright. This is because all three lights "
"are adding color to the scene. This is why the demo uses a :ref:"
"`CanvasModulate <class_CanvasModulate>` in the scene. The :ref:"
"`CanvasModulate <class_CanvasModulate>` multiples the entire viewport by a "
"specific color."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a :ref:`CanvasModulate <class_CanvasModulate>` to the scene and set its "
"color to ``rgb(70, 70, 70)``. This will make the scene sufficiently dark to "
"see the effects of the lights distinctly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now we add the shadow casters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The demo uses a :ref:`Node <class_Node2D>` named \"casters\" to organize the "
"shadow casters. Add a :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` to the scene. It will be "
"used to group all the shadow casters together. This way we can show and hide "
"them all at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each shadow caster is made of a :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>`, with a :ref:"
"`LightOccluder2D <class_LightOccluder2D>` child. For the demo the :ref:"
"`Sprite <class_Sprite>` has a texture set to the `caster image <https://raw."
"githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/master/2d/"
"lights_and_shadows/caster.png>`_ and nothing else. The child :ref:"
"`LightOccluder2D <class_LightOccluder2D>` is where all the magic happens. In "
"a game the :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` could be more than a black box; it "
"could be an image of whatever object is casting the shadow: a wall, a "
"magical chest, or anything else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`LightOccluder2Ds <class_LightOccluder2D>` tell the game what shape the "
"occluder has. They hold an :ref:`OccluderPolygon2D "
"<class_OccluderPolygon2D>`, which is a container for a polygon and some "
"other information. For this demo, since our wall is a square, we set "
"``Polygon`` to a square. The other default settings are fine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first setting, ``Closed`` can be either ``on`` or ``off``. A closed "
"polygon occludes light coming from all directions. An open polygon only "
"occludes light from one direction."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Cull Mode`` lets you select which direction gets culled. The default is "
"``Disabled``, meaning the occluder will cast a shadow no matter which side "
"the light is on. The other two settings ``Clockwise`` and ``Counter-"
"Clockwise`` refer to the winding order of the vertices of the polygon. The "
"winding order is used to determine which side of the line is inside the "
"polygon. Only outward facing lines cast shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To illustrate the difference, here is an image of a :ref:`LightOccluder2D "
"<class_LightOccluder2D>` with ``Closed`` set to ``off`` in the "
"corresponding :ref:`OccluderPolygon2D <class_OccluderPolygon2D>`, so that "
"the lines of the polygon can be seen:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``Cull Mode`` is set to ``Disabled``. All three lines cast shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Cull Mode`` is set to ``Clockwise``. Only the top and right lines cast "
"shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Cull Mode`` is set to ``Counter-Clockwise``. Only the bottom line casts a "
"shadow. If ``Closed`` was set to ``on`` there would be an additional "
"vertical line on the left which would cast a shadow as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you have added the :ref:`LightOccluder2Ds <class_LightOccluder2D>` the "
"shadows still won't appear. You need to go back into the :ref:`Light2Ds "
"<class_Light2D>` and under the Shadow section set ``Enable`` to ``on``. This "
"turns on shadows with hard edges like in the image below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To give the shadows that nice, soft edge look we set the variables "
"``filter``, ``filter smooth``, and ``gradient length``. Godot supports "
"`Percentage Closer Filtering <https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems/"
"gpugems_ch11.html>`_ (PCF), which takes multiple samples of the shadow map "
"around a pixel and blurs them to create a smooth shadow effect. The higher "
"the number of samples the smoother the shadow will look, but the slower it "
"will run. That is why Godot provides 3-13 samples by default and allows you "
"to choose. The demo uses PCF7."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a shadow rendered with the demo's settings. ``gradient length`` is "
"set to ``1.3``, ``filter smooth`` is set to ``11.1``, and ``filter`` is set "
"to ``PCF7``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``filter`` is set to ``PCF13``. Notice how the shadow becomes wider, this is "
"because the distance between samples is based on the variable ``filter "
"smooth``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to make use of filtering you need to set the ``filter smooth`` "
"variable. This dictates how far apart the samples are. If you want the soft "
"area to extend quite far, you can increase the size of ``filter smooth``. "
"However, with few samples and a large filter smooth, you can see lines "
"forming between the samples."
msgstr ""

msgid "``filter smooth`` is set to ``30``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The different :ref:`Light <class_Light2D>` nodes in the demo use different "
"values for filter smooth. Play around with it and see what you like."
msgstr ""

msgid "``filter smooth`` is set to ``0``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Lastly, there is the variable ``gradient length``. For some smooth shadows "
"it is preferable not to have the shadow start immediately on the object, as "
"this produces a hard edge. The gradient length variable creates a smooth "
"gradient to begin the shadow to reduce the effect of the hard edge."
msgstr ""

msgid "``gradient length`` is set to ``0``."
msgstr ""

msgid "``gradient length`` is set to ``10``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You will need to play around with the options a bit to find settings that "
"suit your project. There is no right solution for everyone, which is why "
"Godot provides so much flexibility. Just keep in mind that the higher "
"``filter`` set the more expensive the shadows will be."
