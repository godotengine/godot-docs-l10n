msgid "C# API differences to GDScript"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a (incomplete) list of API differences between C# and GDScript."
msgstr ""

msgid "General differences"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As explained in the :ref:`doc_c_sharp`, C# generally uses ``PascalCase`` "
"instead of the ``snake_case`` used in GDScript and C++."
msgstr ""

msgid "Global scope"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Global functions and some constants had to be moved to classes, since C# "
"does not allow declaring them in namespaces. Most global constants were "
"moved to their own enums."
msgstr ""

msgid "Constants"
msgstr "Konstanty"

msgid ""
"Global constants were moved to their own enums. For example, ``ERR_*`` "
"constants were moved to the ``Error`` enum."
msgstr ""

msgid "Special cases:"
msgstr ""

msgid "GDScript"
msgstr "GDSkript"

msgid "C#"

msgid "``SPKEY``"

msgid "``TYPE_*``"

msgid "``Variant.Type`` enum"
msgstr ""

msgid "``OP_*``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``Variant.Operator`` enum"
msgstr ""

msgid "Math functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Math global functions, like ``abs``, ``acos``, ``asin``, ``atan`` and "
"``atan2``, are located under ``Mathf`` as ``Abs``, ``Acos``, ``Asin``, "
"``Atan`` and ``Atan2``. The ``PI`` constant can be found as ``Mathf.Pi``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Random functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Random global functions, like ``rand_range`` and ``rand_seed``, are located "
"under ``GD``. Example: ``GD.RandRange`` and ``GD.RandSeed``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Other functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many other global functions like ``print`` and ``var2str`` are located under "
"``GD``. Example: ``GD.Print`` and ``GD.Var2Str``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exceptions:"

msgid "``Object.IsInstanceValid(obj)``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tips"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes it can be useful to use the ``using static`` directive. This "
"directive allows to access the members and nested types of a class without "
"specifying the class name."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Export keyword"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the ``[Export]`` attribute instead of the GDScript ``export`` keyword. "
"This attribute can also be provided with optional :ref:"
"`PropertyHint<enum_@GlobalScope_PropertyHint>` and ``hintString`` "
"parameters. Default values can be set by assigning a value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signal keyword"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the ``[Signal]`` attribute to declare a signal instead of the GDScript "
"``signal`` keyword. This attribute should be used on a `delegate`, whose "
"name signature will be used to define the signal."
msgstr ""

msgid "See also: :ref:`doc_c_sharp_signals`."
msgstr "Viz také: :ref:`doc_c_sharp_signals`."

msgid "`onready` keyword"
msgstr "klíčové slovo `onready`"

msgid ""
"GDScript has the ability to defer the initialization of a member variable "
"until the ready function is called with `onready` (cf. :ref:"
"`doc_gdscript_onready_keyword`). For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However C# does not have this ability. To achieve the same effect you need "
"to do this."
msgstr ""

msgid "Singletons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Singletons are available as static classes rather than using the singleton "
"pattern. This is to make code less verbose than it would be with an "
"``Instance`` property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, in some very rare cases this is not enough. For example, you may "
"want to access a member from the base class ``Godot.Object``, like "
"``Connect``. For such use cases we provide a static property named "
"``Singleton`` that returns the singleton instance. The type of this instance "
"is ``Godot.Object``."
msgstr ""

msgid "String"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``System.String`` (``string``). Most of Godot's String methods are "
"provided by the ``StringExtensions`` class as extension methods."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are a few differences, though:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``erase``: Strings are immutable in C#, so we cannot modify the string "
"passed to the extension method. For this reason, ``Erase`` was added as an "
"extension method of ``StringBuilder`` instead of string. Alternatively, you "
"can use ``string.Remove``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``IsSubsequenceOf``/``IsSubsequenceOfi``: An additional method is provided, "
"which is an overload of ``IsSubsequenceOf``, allowing you to explicitly "
"specify case sensitivity:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Match``/``Matchn``/``ExprMatch``: An additional method is provided besides "
"``Match`` and ``Matchn``, which allows you to explicitly specify case "
"sensitivity:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Basis"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Structs cannot have parameterless constructors in C#. Therefore, ``new "
"Basis()`` initializes all primitive members to their default value. Use "
"``Basis.Identity`` for the equivalent of ``Basis()`` in GDScript and C++."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following method was converted to a property with a different name:"

msgid "``get_scale()``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``Scale``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Transform2D"
msgstr ""

"Structs cannot have parameterless constructors in C#. Therefore, ``new "

"Please use ``Transform2D.Identity`` for the equivalent of ``Transform2D()`` "
"in GDScript and C++."
