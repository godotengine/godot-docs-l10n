"Signals provide a way to decouple game objects, allowing you to avoid "
"forcing a fixed arrangement of nodes. One sign that a signal might be called "
"for is when you find yourself using ``get_parent()``. Referring directly to "
"a node's parent means that you can't easily move that node to another "
"location in the scene tree. This can be especially problematic when you are "
"instancing objects at runtime and may want to place them in an arbitrary "
"location in the running scene tree."

"Consider a player character that can rotate and shoot towards the mouse. "
"Every time the mouse button is clicked, we create an instance of the bullet "
"at the player's location. See :ref:`doc_instancing` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We'll use an ``Area2D`` for the bullet, which moves in a straight line at a "
"given velocity:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, if the bullets are added as children of the player, then they will "
"remain \"attached\" to the player as it rotates:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead, we need the bullets to be independent of the player's movement - "
"once fired, they should continue traveling in a straight line and the player "
"can no longer affect them. Instead of being added to the scene tree as a "
"child of the player, it makes more sense to add the bullet as a child of the "
"\"main\" game scene, which may be the player's parent or even further up the "
"tree."
msgstr ""

msgid "You could do this by adding the bullet to the main scene directly:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, this will lead to a different problem. Now if you try to test your "
"\"Player\" scene independently, it will crash on shooting, because there is "
"no parent node to access. This makes it a lot harder to test your player "
"code independently and also means that if you decide to change your main "
"scene's node structure, the player's parent may no longer be the appropriate "
"node to receive the bullets."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The solution to this is to use a signal to \"emit\" the bullets from the "
"player. The player then has no need to \"know\" what happens to the bullets "
"after that - whatever node is connected to the signal can \"receive\" the "
"bullets and take the appropriate action to spawn them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is the code for the player using signals to emit the bullet:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the main scene, we then connect the player's signal (it will appear in "
"the \"Node\" tab of the Inspector)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now the bullets will maintain their own movement independent of the player's "
"rotation:"
