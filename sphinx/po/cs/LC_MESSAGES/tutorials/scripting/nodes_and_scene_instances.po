msgid "Nodes and scene instances"
msgstr "Instance uzlů a scén"

msgid ""
"This guide explains how to get nodes, create nodes, add them as a child, and "
"instantiate scenes from code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Getting nodes"
msgstr "Získávání uzlů"

msgid ""
"You can get a reference to a node by calling the :ref:`Node.get_node() "
"<class_Node_method_get_node>` method. For this to work, the child node must "
"be present in the scene tree. Getting it in the parent node's ``_ready()`` "
"function guarantees that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If, for example,  you have a scene tree like this, and you want to get a "
"reference to the Sprite2D and Camera2D nodes to access them in your script."
msgstr ""

msgid "To do so, you can use the following code."
msgstr "K tomu můžete použít následující kód."

msgid ""
"Note that you get nodes using their name, not their type. Above, "
"\"Sprite2D\" and \"Camera2D\" are the nodes' names in the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you rename the Sprite2D node as Skin in the Scene dock, you have to "
"change the line that gets the node to ``get_node(\"Skin\")`` in the script."
msgstr ""

msgid "Node paths"
msgstr "Cesty k uzlům"

msgid ""
"When getting a reference to a node, you're not limited to getting a direct "
"child. The ``get_node()`` function supports paths, a bit like when working "
"with a file browser. Add a slash to separate nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Take the following example scene, with the script attached to the "
"UserInterface node."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "To get the AnimationPlayer node, you would use the following code."
msgstr "K tomu můžete použít následující kód."

msgid ""
"As with file paths, you can use \"..\" to get a parent node. The best "
"practice is to avoid doing that though not to break encapsulation. You can "
"also start the path with a forward slash to make it absolute, in which case "
"your topmost node would be \"/root\", the application's predefined root "
"viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid "Syntactic sugar"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use two shorthands to shorten your code in GDScript. Firstly, "
"putting the ``@onready`` annotation before a member variable makes it "
"initialize right before the ``_ready()`` callback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is also a short notation for ``get_node()``: the dollar sign, \"$\". "
"You place it before the name or path of the node you want to get."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating nodes"
msgstr "Vytváření uzlů"

msgid ""
"To create a node from code, call its ``new()`` method like for any other "
"class-based datatype."
msgstr ""
"Chcete-li vytvořit uzel v kódu, volejte metodu ``.new ()``, tak jako pro "
"jakýkoli jiný datový typ třídy."

msgid ""
"You can store the newly created node's reference in a variable and call "
"``add_child()`` to add it as a child of the node to which you attached the "
"script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To delete a node and free it from memory, you can call its ``queue_free()`` "
"method. Doing so queues the node for deletion at the end of the current "
"frame after it has finished processing. At that point, the engine removes "
"the node from the scene and frees the object in memory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before calling ``sprite2d.queue_free()``, the remote scene tree looks like "
"this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the engine freed the node, the remote scene tree doesn't display the "
"sprite anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can alternatively call ``free()`` to immediately destroy the node. You "
"should do this with care as any reference to it will instantly become "
"``null``. We recommend using ``queue_free()`` unless you know what you're "
"doing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you free a node, it also frees all its children. Thanks to this, to "
"delete an entire branch of the scene tree, you only have to free the topmost "
"parent node."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instancing scenes"
msgstr "Vytvoření instance scény"

msgid ""
"Scenes are templates from which you can create as many reproductions as "
"you'd like. This operation is called instancing, and doing it from code "
"happens in two steps:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Loading the scene from the local drive."
msgstr "Načítání scény z pevného disku."

msgid ""
"Creating an instance of the loaded :ref:`PackedScene <class_PackedScene>` "
"resource."
msgstr ""
"Vytvoření instance načteného prostředku :ref:`PackedScene "
"<class_PackedScene>`."

msgid ""
"Preloading the scene can improve the user's experience as the load operation "
"happens when the compiler reads the script and not at runtime. This feature "
"is only available with GDScript."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"At that point, ``scene`` is a packed scene resource, not a node. To create "
"the actual node, you need to call :ref:`PackedScene.instantiate() "
"<class_PackedScene_method_instantiate>`. It returns a tree of nodes that you "
"can use as a child of your current node."
msgstr ""
"V tomto okamžiku je ``scene`` zabaleným prostředkem scény, nikoli uzlem. "
"Chcete-li vytvořit skutečný uzel, musíte zavolat :ref:`PackedScene."
"instance() <class_PackedScene_method_instance>`. Vrátí strom uzlů, které "
"můžete jako potomka aktuálního uzlu."

msgid ""
"The advantage of this two-step process is you can keep a packed scene loaded "
"and create new instances on the fly. For example, to quickly instance "
"several enemies or bullets."
msgstr ""
"Výhodou tohoto dvoustupňového procesu je, že zabalená scéna může být nahrána "
"a připravena k použití, takže jste schopni vytvořit libovolný počet "
"instancí. To je užitečné zejména při rychlém nasazení několika nepřátel, "
"kulek a dalších entit do aktivní scény."
