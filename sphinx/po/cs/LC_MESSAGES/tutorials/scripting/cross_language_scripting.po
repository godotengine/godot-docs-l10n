"Godot allows you to mix and match scripting languages to suit your needs. "
"This means a single project can define nodes in both C# and GDScript. This "
"page will go through the possible interactions between two nodes written in "
"different languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following two scripts will be used as references throughout this page."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instantiating nodes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're not using nodes from the scene tree, you'll probably want to "
"instantiate nodes directly from the code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instantiating C# nodes from GDScript"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using C# from GDScript doesn't need much work. Once loaded (see :ref:"
"`doc_gdscript_classes_as_resources`), the script can be instantiated with :"
"ref:`new() <class_CSharpScript_method_new>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When creating ``.cs`` scripts, you should always keep in mind that the class "
"Godot will use is the one named like the ``.cs`` file itself. If that class "
"does not exist in the file, you'll see the following error: ``Invalid call. "
"Nonexistent function `new` in base``."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, MyCoolNode.cs should contain a class named MyCoolNode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The C# class needs to derive a Godot class, for example ``GodotObject``. "
"Otherwise, the same error will occur."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You also need to check your ``.cs`` file is referenced in the project's ``."
"csproj`` file. Otherwise, the same error will occur."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instantiating GDScript nodes from C#"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From the C# side, everything work the same way. Once loaded, the GDScript "
"can be instantiated with :ref:`GDScript.New() <class_GDScript_method_new>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here we are using an :ref:`class_Object`, but you can use type conversion "
"like explained in :ref:`doc_c_sharp_features_type_conversion_and_casting`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing fields"
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing C# fields from GDScript"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Accessing C# fields from GDScript is straightforward, you shouldn't have "
"anything to worry about."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing GDScript fields from C#"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As C# is statically typed, accessing GDScript from C# is a bit more "
"convoluted, you will have to use :ref:`GodotObject.Get() "
"<class_Object_method_get>` and :ref:`GodotObject.Set() "
"<class_Object_method_set>`. The first argument is the name of the field you "
"want to access."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that when setting a field value you should only use types the "
"GDScript side knows about. Essentially, you want to work with built-in types "
"as described in :ref:`doc_gdscript` or classes extending :ref:`class_Object`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Calling methods"
msgstr ""

msgid "Calling C# methods from GDScript"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Again, calling C# methods from GDScript should be straightforward. The "
"marshalling process will do its best to cast the arguments to match function "
"signatures. If that's impossible, you'll see the following error: ``Invalid "
"call. Nonexistent function `FunctionName```."
msgstr ""

msgid "Calling GDScript methods from C#"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To call GDScript methods from C# you'll need to use :ref:`GodotObject.Call() "
"<class_Object_method_call>`. The first argument is the name of the method "
"you want to call. The following arguments will be passed to said method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see, if the first argument of the called method is an array, "
"you'll need to cast it as ``object``. Otherwise, each element of your array "
"will be treated as a single argument and the function signature won't match."
msgstr ""

msgid "Inheritance"
msgstr "Dědičnost"

msgid ""
"A GDScript file may not inherit from a C# script. Likewise, a C# script may "
"not inherit from a GDScript file. Due to how complex this would be to "
"implement, this limitation is unlikely to be lifted in the future. See `this "
"GitHub issue <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/38352>`__ for more "
"information."
