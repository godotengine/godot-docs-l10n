msgid "BBCode in RichTextLabel"
msgstr ""

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Úvod"

msgid ""
"Label nodes are great for displaying basic text, but they have limits. If "
"you want to change the color of the text, or its alignment, that change "
"affects all of the text in the Label node. You can't have only one part of "
"the text be one color, or only one part of the text be centered. To get "
"around this limitation you would use a :ref:`class_RichTextLabel`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`class_RichTextLabel` allows the display of complex text markup in a "
"Control. It has a built-in API for generating the markup, but can also parse "
"a BBCode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the BBCode tags can also be used, to some extent, in the :ref:`XML "
"source of the class reference <doc_updating_the_class_reference>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using BBCode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For uniformly formatted text you can write in the \"Text\" property, but if "
"you want to use BBCode markup you should use the \"Text\" property in the "
"\"Bb Code\" section instead (``bbcode_text``). Writing to this property will "
"trigger the parsing of your markup to format the text as requested. Before "
"this happens, you need to toggle the \"Enabled\" checkbox in the \"Bb Code\" "
"section (``bbcode_enabled``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, ``BBCode [color=blue]blue[/color]`` would render the word "
"\"blue\" with a blue color."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You'll notice that after writing in the BBCode \"Text\" property the regular "
"\"Text\" property now has the text without the BBCode. While the text "
"property will be updated by the BBCode property, you can't edit the text "
"property or you'll lose the BBCode markup. All changes to the text must be "
"done in the BBCode parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For BBCode tags such as ``[b]`` (bold), ``[i]`` (italics) or ``[code]`` to "
"work, you must set up custom fonts for the RichTextLabel node first."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are no BBCode tags to control vertical centering of text yet."

"For transparent RGB colors, any 8-digit hexadecimal code can be used, e.g. "
"``[color=#88ffffff]translucent white[/color]``. In this case, note that the "

"are also supported."
msgstr ""

msgid "Handling ``[url]`` tag clicks"

msgid ""
"By default, ``[url]`` tags do nothing when clicked. This is to allow "
"flexible use of ``[url]`` tags rather than limiting them to opening URLs in "
"a web browser."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To handle clicked ``[url]`` tags, connect the RichTextLabel node's :ref:"
"`meta_clicked <class_RichTextLabel_signal_meta_clicked>` signal to a script "
"function."

msgid ""
"For example, the following method can be connected to ``meta_clicked`` to "
"open clicked URLs using the user's default web browser::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more advanced use cases, it's also possible to store JSON in an "
"``[url]`` tag's option and parse it in the function that handles the "
"``meta_clicked`` signal. For example: ``[url={\"example\": \"value\"}]JSON[/"
"url]``"

"BBCode can also be used to create different text animation effects. Five "
"customizable effects are provided out of the box, and you can easily create "
"your own."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wave"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wave makes the text go up and down. Its tag format is ``[wave amp=50 freq=2]"
"[/wave]``. ``amp`` controls how high and low the effect goes, and ``freq`` "
"controls how fast the text goes up and down."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tornado"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tornao makes the text move around in a circle. Its tag format is ``[tornado "
"radius=5 freq=2][/tornado]``. ``radius`` is the radius of the circle that "
"controls the offset, ``freq`` is how fast the text moves in a circle."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shake"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shake makes the text shake. Its tag format is ``[shake rate=5 level=10][/"
"shake]``. ``rate`` controls how fast the text shakes, ``level`` controls how "
"far the text is offset from the origin."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fade"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Fade creates a fade effect over the text that is not animated. Its tag "
"format is ``[fade start=4 length=14][/fade]``. ``start`` controls the "
"starting position of the falloff relative to where the fade command is "
"inserted, ``length`` controls over how many characters should the fade out "
"take place."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rainbow"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rainbow gives the text a rainbow color that changes over time. Its tag "
"format is ``[rainbow freq=0.2 sat=10 val=20][/rainbow]``. ``freq`` is the "
"number of full rainbow cycles per second, ``sat`` is the saturation of the "
"rainbow, ``val`` is the value of the rainbow."
msgstr ""

msgid "Custom BBCode tags and text effects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can extend the :ref:`class_RichTextEffect` resource type to create your "
"own custom BBCode tags. You begin by extending the :ref:"
"`class_RichTextEffect` resource type. Add the ``tool`` prefix to your "
"GDScript file if you wish to have these custom effects run within the editor "
"itself. The RichTextLabel does not need to have a script attached, nor does "
"it need to be running in ``tool`` mode. The new effect will be activable in "
"the Inspector through the **Custom Effects** property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the custom effect is not registered within the RichTextLabel's **Custom "
"Effects** property, no effect will be visible and the original tag will be "
"left as-is."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is only one function that you need to extend: "
"``_process_custom_fx(char_fx)``. Optionally, you can also provide a custom "
"BBCode identifier simply by adding a member name ``bbcode``. The code will "
"check the ``bbcode`` property automatically or will use the name of the file "
"to determine what the BBCode tag should be."
msgstr ""

msgid "``_process_custom_fx``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is where the logic of each effect takes place and is called once per "
"character during the draw phase of text rendering. This passes in a :ref:"
"`class_CharFXTransform` object, which holds a few variables to control how "
"the associated character is rendered:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``identity`` specifies which custom effect is being processed. You should "
"use that for code flow control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``relative_index`` tells you how far into a given custom effect block you "
"are in as an index."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``absolute_index`` tells you how far into the entire text you are as an "
"index."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``elapsed_time`` is the total amount of time the text effect has been "
"running."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``visible`` will tell you whether the character is visible or not and will "
"also allow you to hide a given portion of text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``offset`` is an offset position relative to where the given character "
"should render under normal circumstances."
msgstr ""

msgid "``color`` is the color of a given character."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, ``env`` is a :ref:`class_Dictionary` of parameters assigned to a "
"given custom effect. You can use :ref:`get() <class_Dictionary_method_get>` "
"with an optional default value to retrieve each parameter, if specified by "
"the user. For example ``[custom_fx spread=0.5 color=#FFFF00]test[/"
"custom_fx]`` would have a float ``spread`` and Color ``color`` parameters in "
"its ` `env`` Dictionary. See below for more usage examples."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last thing to note about this function is that it is necessary to return "
"a boolean ``true`` value to verify that the effect processed correctly. This "
"way, if there's a problem with rendering a given character, it will back out "
"of rendering custom effects entirely until the user fixes whatever error "
"cropped up in their custom effect logic."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are some examples of custom effects:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ghost"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pulse"
msgstr ""

msgid "Matrix"
