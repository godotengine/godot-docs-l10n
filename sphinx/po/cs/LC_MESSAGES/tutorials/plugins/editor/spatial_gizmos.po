msgid ""
"Spatial gizmo plugins are used by the editor and custom plugins to define "
"the gizmos attached to any kind of Spatial node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial will show you the two main approaches to defining your own "
"custom gizmos. The first option works well for simple gizmos and creates "
"less clutter in your plugin structure, while the second one will let you "
"store some per-gizmo data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial assumes you already know how to make generic plugins. If in "
"doubt, refer to the :ref:`doc_making_plugins` page."
msgstr ""

msgid "The EditorSpatialGizmoPlugin"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regardless of the approach we choose, we will need to create a new :ref:"
"`EditorSpatialGizmoPlugin <class_EditorSpatialGizmoPlugin>`. This will allow "
"us to set a name for the new gizmo type and define other behaviors such as "
"whether the gizmo can be hidden or not."
msgstr ""

msgid "This would be a basic setup:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For simple gizmos, just inheriting :ref:`EditorSpatialGizmoPlugin "
"<class_EditorSpatialGizmoPlugin>` is enough. If you want to store some per-"
"gizmo data or you are porting a Godot 3.0 gizmo to 3.1+, you should go with "
"the second approach."
msgstr ""

msgid "Simple approach"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first step is to, in our custom gizmo plugin, override the :ref:"
"`has_gizmo()<class_EditorSpatialGizmoPlugin_method_has_gizmo>` method so "
"that it returns ``true`` when the spatial parameter is of our target type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then we can override methods like :ref:"
"`redraw()<class_EditorSpatialGizmoPlugin_method_redraw>` or all the handle "
"related ones."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we created a material in the `_init` method, and retrieved it in "
"the `redraw` method using :ref:"
"`get_material()<class_EditorSpatialGizmoPlugin_method_get_material>`. This "
"method retrieves one of the material's variants depending on the state of "
"the gizmo (selected and/or editable)."
msgstr ""

msgid "So the final plugin would look somewhat like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we just added some handles in the redraw method, but we still need "
"to implement the rest of handle-related callbacks in :ref:"
"`EditorSpatialGizmoPlugin <class_EditorSpatialGizmoPlugin>` to get properly "
"working handles."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternative approach"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In some cases we want to provide our own implementation of :ref:"
"`EditorSpatialGizmo<class_EditorSpatialGizmo>`, maybe because we want to "
"have some state stored in each gizmo or because we are porting an old gizmo "
"plugin and we don't want to go through the rewriting process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In these cases all we need to do is, in our new gizmo plugin, override :ref:"
"`create_gizmo()<class_EditorSpatialGizmoPlugin_method_create_gizmo>`, so it "
"returns our custom gizmo implementation for the Spatial nodes we want to "
"target."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This way all the gizmo logic and drawing methods can be implemented in a new "
"class extending :ref:`EditorSpatialGizmo<class_EditorSpatialGizmo>`, like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we just added some handles in the redraw method, but we still need "
"to implement the rest of handle-related callbacks in :ref:"
"`EditorSpatialGizmo<class_EditorSpatialGizmo>` to get properly working "
"handles."
