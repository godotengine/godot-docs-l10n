msgid "When and how to avoid using nodes for everything"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Nodes are cheap to produce, but even they have their limits. A project may "
"have tens of thousands of nodes all doing things. The more complex their "
"behavior though, the larger the strain each one adds to a project's "
"performance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides more lightweight objects for creating APIs which nodes use. "
"Be sure to keep these in mind as options when designing how you wish to "
"build your project's features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Object <class_Object>`: The ultimate lightweight object, the original "
"Object must use manual memory management. With that said, it isn't too "
"difficult to create one's own custom data structures, even node structures, "
"that are also lighter than the :ref:`Node <class_Node>` class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Example:** See the :ref:`Tree <class_Tree>` node. It supports a high level "
"of customization for a table of content with an arbitrary number of rows and "
"columns. The data that it uses to generate its visualization though is "
"actually a tree of :ref:`TreeItem <class_TreeItem>` Objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Advantages:** Simplifying one's API to smaller scoped objects helps "
"improve its accessibility and improve iteration time. Rather than working "
"with the entire Node library, one creates an abbreviated set of Objects from "
"which a node can generate and manage the appropriate sub-nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One should be careful when handling them. One can store an Object into a "
"variable, but these references can become invalid without warning. For "
"example, if the object's creator decides to delete it out of nowhere, this "
"would trigger an error state when one next accesses it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Reference <class_Reference>`: Only a little more complex than Object. "
"They track references to themselves, only deleting loaded memory when no "
"further references to themselves exist. These are useful in the majority of "
"cases where one needs data in a custom class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Example:** See the :ref:`File <class_File>` object. It functions just like "
"a regular Object except that one need not delete it themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Advantages:** same as the Object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Resource <class_Resource>`: Only slightly more complex than Reference. "
"They have the innate ability to serialize/deserialize (i.e. save and load) "
"their object properties to/from Godot resource files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Example:** Scripts, PackedScene (for scene files), and other types like "
"each of the :ref:`AudioEffect <class_AudioEffect>` classes. Each of these "
"can be save and loaded, therefore they extend from Resource."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Advantages:** Much has :ref:`already been said <doc_resources>` on :ref:"
"`Resource <class_Resource>`'s advantages over traditional data storage "
"methods. In the context of using Resources over Nodes though, their main "
"advantage is in Inspector-compatibility. While nearly as lightweight as "
"Object/Reference, they can still display and export properties in the "
"Inspector. This allows them to fulfill a purpose much like sub-Nodes on the "
"usability front, but also improve performance if one plans to have many such "
"Resources/Nodes in their scenes."
