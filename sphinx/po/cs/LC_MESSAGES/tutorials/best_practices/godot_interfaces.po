"Often one needs scripts that rely on other objects for features. There are 2 "
"parts to this process:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Acquiring a reference to the object that presumably has the features."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing the data or logic from the object."
msgstr ""

msgid "The rest of this tutorial outlines the various ways of doing all this."
msgstr ""

msgid "Acquiring object references"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For all :ref:`Object <class_Object>`\\s, the most basic way of referencing "
"them is to get a reference to an existing object from another acquired "
"instance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same principle applies for :ref:`RefCounted <class_RefCounted>` objects. "
"While users often access :ref:`Node <class_Node>` and :ref:`Resource "
"<class_Resource>` this way, alternative measures are available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of property or method access, one can get Resources by load access."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are many ways in which a language can load such resources."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When designing how objects will access data, don't forget that one can pass "
"resources around as references as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that loading a resource fetches the cached resource instance "
"maintained by the engine. To get a new object, one must :ref:`duplicate "
"<class_Resource_method_duplicate>` an existing reference or instantiate one "
"from scratch with ``new()``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nodes likewise have an alternative access point: the SceneTree."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing data or logic from an object"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's scripting API is duck-typed. This means that if a script executes an "
"operation, Godot doesn't validate that it supports the operation by "
"**type**. It instead checks that the object **implements** the individual "
"method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` class has a "
"``visible`` property. All properties exposed to the scripting API are in "
"fact a setter and getter pair bound to a name. If one tried to access :ref:"
"`CanvasItem.visible <class_CanvasItem_property_visible>`, then Godot would "
"do the following checks, in order:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the object has a script attached, it will attempt to set the property "
"through the script. This leaves open the opportunity for scripts to override "
"a property defined on a base object by overriding the setter method for the "
"property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the script does not have the property, it performs a HashMap lookup in "
"the ClassDB for the \"visible\" property against the CanvasItem class and "
"all of its inherited types. If found, it will call the bound setter or "
"getter. For more information about HashMaps, see the :ref:`data preferences "
"<doc_data_preferences>` docs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If not found, it does an explicit check to see if the user wants to access "
"the \"script\" or \"meta\" properties."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If not, it checks for a ``_set``/``_get`` implementation (depending on type "
"of access) in the CanvasItem and its inherited types. These methods can "
"execute logic that gives the impression that the Object has a property. This "
"is also the case with the ``_get_property_list`` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that this happens even for non-legal symbol names, such as names "
"starting with a digit or containing a slash."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, this duck-typed system can locate a property either in the "
"script, the object's class, or any class that object inherits, but only for "
"things which extend Object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides a variety of options for performing runtime checks on these "
"accesses:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A duck-typed property access. These will be property checks (as described "
"above). If the operation isn't supported by the object, execution will halt."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A method check. In the case of :ref:`CanvasItem.visible "
"<class_CanvasItem_property_visible>`, one can access the methods, "
"``set_visible`` and ``is_visible`` like any other method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Outsource the access to a :ref:`Callable <class_Callable>`. These may be "
"useful in cases where one needs the max level of freedom from dependencies. "
"In this case, one relies on an external context to setup the method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These strategies contribute to Godot's flexible design. Between them, users "
"have a breadth of tools to meet their specific needs."
