msgid "Using AnimationTree"
msgstr "Použití AnimationTree (Stromu animací)"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Úvod"

msgid ""
"With :ref:`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>`, Godot has one of the "
"most flexible animation systems that you can find in any game engine. The "
"ability to animate almost any property in any node or resource, as well as "
"having dedicated transform, bezier, function calling, audio and sub-"
"animation tracks, is pretty much unique."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, the support for blending those animations via ``AnimationPlayer`` "
"is relatively limited, as only a fixed cross-fade transition time can be set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`AnimationTree <class_AnimationTree>` is a new node introduced in Godot "
"3.1 to deal with advanced transitions. It supersedes the ancient "
"``AnimationTreePlayer``, while adding a huge amount of features and "
"flexibility."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating an AnimationTree"
msgstr "Vytvoření AnimationTree"

msgid ""
"Before starting, it must be made clear that an ``AnimationTree`` node does "
"not contain its own animations. Instead, it uses animations contained in an "
"``AnimationPlayer`` node. This way, you can edit your animations (or import "
"them from a 3D scene) as usual and then use this extra node to control the "
"playback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The most common way to use ``AnimationTree`` is in a 3D scene. When "
"importing your scenes from a 3D exchange format, they will usually come with "
"animations built-in (either multiple ones or split from a large one on "
"import). At the end, the imported Godot scene will contain the animations in "
"a ``AnimationPlayer`` node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you rarely use imported scenes directly in Godot (they are either "
"instantiated or inherited from), you can place the ``AnimationTree`` node in "
"your new scene which contains the imported one. Afterwards, point the "
"``AnimationTree`` node to the ``AnimationPlayer`` that was created in the "
"imported scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is how it's done in the `Third Person Shooter demo <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/tps-demo>`_, for reference:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A new scene was created for the player with a ``CharacterBody3D`` as root. "
"Inside this scene, the original ``.dae`` (Collada) file was instantiated and "
"an ``AnimationTree`` node was created."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a tree"
msgstr "Vytvoření stromu"

msgid ""
"There are three main types of nodes that can be used in ``AnimationTree``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Animation nodes, which reference an animation from the linked "
"``AnimationPlayer``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Animation Root nodes, which are used to blend sub-nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Animation Blend nodes, which are used within ``AnimationNodeBlendTree`` as "
"single-graph blending via multiple input ports."
msgstr ""

msgid "To set a root node in ``AnimationTree``, a few types are available:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``AnimationNodeAnimation``: Selects an animation from the list and plays it. "
"This is the simplest root node, and generally not used directly as root."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``AnimationNodeBlendTree``: Contains many *blend* type nodes, such as mix, "
"blend2, blend3, one shot, etc. This is one of the most commonly used roots."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``AnimationNodeStateMachine``: Contains multiple root nodes as children in a "
"graph. Each node is used as a *state*, and provides multiple functions to "
"alternate between states."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``AnimationNodeBlendSpace2D``: Allows placing root nodes in a 2D blend "
"space. Control the blend position in 2D to mix between multiple animations."
msgstr ""

msgid "``AnimationNodeBlendSpace1D``: Simplified version of the above (1D)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Blend tree"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An ``AnimationNodeBlendTree`` can contain both root and regular nodes used "
"for blending. Nodes are added to the graph from a menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All blend trees contain an ``Output`` node by default, and something has to "
"be connected to it in order for animations to play."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The easiest way to test this functionality is to connect an ``Animation`` "
"node to it directly:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will simply play back the animation. Make sure that the "
"``AnimationTree`` is active for something to actually happen."
msgstr ""

msgid "Following is a short description of available nodes:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Blend2 / Blend3"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These nodes will blend between two or three inputs by a user-specified blend "
"value:"
msgstr ""

msgid "For more complex blending, it is advised to use blend spaces instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Blending can also use filters, i.e. you can control individually which "
"tracks go through the blend function. This is very useful for layering "
"animations on top of each other."
msgstr ""

msgid "OneShot"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This node will execute a sub-animation and return once it finishes. Blend "
"times for fading in and out can be customized, as well as filters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After setting the request and changing the animation playback, the one-shot "
"node automatically clears the request on the next process frame by setting "
"its ``request`` value to ``AnimationNodeOneShot.ONE_SHOT_REQUEST_NONE``."
msgstr ""

msgid "TimeSeek"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This node can be used to cause a seek command to happen to any sub-children "
"of the animation graph. Use this node type to play an ``Animation`` from the "
"start or a certain playback position inside the ``AnimationNodeBlendTree``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After setting the time and changing the animation playback, the seek node "
"automatically goes into sleep mode on the next process frame by setting its "
"``seek_request`` value to ``-1.0``."
msgstr ""

msgid "TimeScale"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Allows scaling the speed of the animation (or reverse it) connected to the "
"`in` input via the `scale` parameter. Setting the `scale` to 0 will pause "
"the animation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Transition"
msgstr "Přechod"

msgid ""
"Very simple state machine (when you don't want to cope with a "
"``StateMachine`` node). Animations can be connected to the outputs and "
"transition times can be specified. After setting the request and changing "
"the animation playback, the transition node automatically clears the request "
"on the next process frame by setting its ``transition_request`` value to an "
"empty string (``\"\"``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "BlendSpace2D"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``BlendSpace2D`` is a node to do advanced blending in two dimensions. Points "
"are added to a two-dimensional space and then a position can be controlled "
"to determine blending:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ranges in X and Y can be controlled (and labeled for convenience). By "
"default, points can be placed anywhere (right-click on the coordinate system "
"or use the *add point* button) and triangles will be generated automatically "
"using Delaunay."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is also possible to draw the triangles manually by disabling the *auto "
"triangle* option, though this is rarely necessary:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, it is possible to change the blend mode. By default, blending "
"happens by interpolating points inside the closest triangle. When dealing "
"with 2D animations (frame by frame), you may want to switch to *Discrete* "
"mode. Alternatively, if you want to keep the current play position when "
"switching between discrete animations, there is a *Carry* mode. This mode "
"can be changed in the *Blend* menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid "BlendSpace1D"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is similar to 2D blend spaces, but in one dimension (so triangles are "
"not needed)."
msgstr ""

msgid "StateMachine"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This node acts as a state machine with root nodes as states. Root nodes can "
"be created and connected via lines. States are connected via *Transitions*, "
"which are connections with special properties. Transitions are uni-"
"directional, but two can be used to connect in both directions."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "There are many types of transition:"
msgstr "Existují dva hlavní způsoby, jak zmírnit páskování:"

msgid ""
"*Immediate*: Will switch to the next state immediately. The current state "
"will end and blend into the beginning of the new one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Sync*: Will switch to the next state immediately, but will seek the new "
"state to the playback position of the old state."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*At End*: Will wait for the current state playback to end, then switch to "
"the beginning of the next state animation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Transitions also have a few properties. Click any transition and it will be "
"displayed in the inspector dock:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Switch Mode* is the transition type (see above), it can be modified after "
"creation here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Auto Advance* will turn on the transition automatically when this state is "
"reached. This works best with the *At End* switch mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Advance Condition* will turn on auto advance when this condition is set. "
"This is a custom text field that can be filled with a variable name. The "
"variable can be modified from code (more on this later)."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Xfade Time* is the time to cross-fade between this state and the next."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Priority* is used together with the ``travel()`` function from code (more "
"on this later). Lower priority transitions are preferred when travelling "
"through the tree."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Disabled* toggles disabling this transition (when disabled, it will not be "
"used during travel or auto advance)."
msgstr ""

msgid "For better blending"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot 4.0+, in order for the blending results to be deterministic "
"(reproducible and always consistent), the blended property values must have "
"a specific initial value. For example, in the case of two animations to be "
"blended, if one animation has a property track and the other does not, the "
"blended animation is calculated as if the latter animation had a property "
"track with the initial value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using Position/Rotation/Scale 3D tracks for Skeleton3D bones, the "
"initial value is Bone Rest. For other properties, the initial value is ``0`` "
"and if the track is present in the ``RESET`` animation, the value of its "
"first keyframe is used instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the following AnimationPlayer has two animations, but one of "
"them lacks a Property track for Position."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means that the animation lacking that will treat those Positions as "
"``Vector2(0, 0)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This problem can be solved by adding a Property track for Position as an "
"initial value to the ``RESET`` animation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Be aware that the ``RESET`` animation exists to define the default pose when "
"loading an object originally. It is assumed to have only one frame and is "
"not expected to be played back using the timeline."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also keep in mind that the Rotation 3D tracks and the Property tracks for 2D "
"rotation with Interpolation Type set to Linear Angle or Cubic Angle will "
"prevent rotation of more than 180 degrees from the initial value as blended "
"animation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can be useful for Skeleton3Ds to prevent the bones penetrating the body "
"when blending animations. Therefore, Skeleton3D's Bone Rest values should be "
"as close to the midpoint of the movable range as possible. **This means that "
"for humanoid models, it is preferable to import them in a T-pose**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can see that the shortest rotation path from Bone Rests is prioritized "
"rather than the shortest rotation path between animations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to rotate Skeleton3D itself more than 180 degrees by blend "
"animations for movement, you can use Root Motion."
msgstr ""

msgid "Root motion"
msgstr "Kořenový pohyb"

msgid ""
"When working with 3D animations, a popular technique is for animators to use "
"the root skeleton bone to give motion to the rest of the skeleton. This "
"allows animating characters in a way where steps actually match the floor "
"below. It also allows precise interaction with objects during cinematics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When playing back the animation in Godot, it is possible to select this bone "
"as the *root motion track*. Doing so will cancel the bone transformation "
"visually (the animation will stay in place)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Afterwards, the actual motion can be retrieved via the :ref:`AnimationTree "
"<class_AnimationTree>` API as a transform:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can be fed to functions such as :ref:`CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide "
"<class_CharacterBody3D_method_move_and_slide>` to control the character "
"movement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is also a tool node, ``RootMotionView``, that can be placed in a scene "
"and will act as a custom floor for your character and animations (this node "
"is disabled by default during the game)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Controlling from code"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After building the tree and previewing it, the only question remaining is "
"\"How is all this controlled from code?\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that the animation nodes are just resources and, as such, they "
"are shared between all instances using them. Setting values in the nodes "
"directly will affect all instances of the scene that uses this "
"``AnimationTree``. This is generally undesirable, but does have some cool "
"use cases, e.g. you can copy and paste parts of your animation tree, or "
"reuse nodes with a complex layout (such as a state machine or blend space) "
"in different animation trees."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The actual animation data is contained in the ``AnimationTree`` node and is "
"accessed via properties. Check the \"Parameters\" section of the "
"``AnimationTree`` node to see all the parameters that can be modified in "
"real-time:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is handy because it makes it possible to animate them from an "
"``AnimationPlayer``, or even the ``AnimationTree`` itself, allowing the "
"realization of very complex animation logic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To modify these values from code, the property path must be obtained. This "
"is done easily by hovering the mouse over any of the parameters:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Which allows setting them or reading them:"
msgstr ""

msgid "State machine travel"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of the nice features in Godot's ``StateMachine`` implementation is the "
"ability to travel. The graph can be instructed to go from the current state "
"to another one, while visiting all the intermediate ones. This is done via "
"the A\\* algorithm. If there is no path of transitions starting at the "
"current state and finishing at the destination state, the graph teleports to "
"the destination state."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To use the travel ability, you should first retrieve the :ref:"
"`AnimationNodeStateMachinePlayback "
"<class_AnimationNodeStateMachinePlayback>` object from the ``AnimationTree`` "
"node (it is exported as a property)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once retrieved, it can be used by calling one of the many functions it "
"offers:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The state machine must be running before you can travel. Make sure to either "
"call ``start()`` or choose a node to **Autoplay on Load**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "Stav překladu"
