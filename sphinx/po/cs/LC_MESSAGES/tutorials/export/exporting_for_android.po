msgid "Create a debug.keystore"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Android needs a debug keystore file to install to devices and distribute non-"
"release APKs. If you have used the SDK before and have built projects, ant "
"or eclipse probably generated one for you (in the ``~/.android`` directory "
"on Linux and macOS, in the ``C:\\Users\\<user>\\.android\\`` directory on "
"Windows)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you can't find it or need to generate one, the keytool command from the "
"JDK can be used for this purpose::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will create a ``debug.keystore`` file in your current directory. You "
"should move it to a memorable location such as ``%USERPROFILE%\\."
"android\\``, because you will need its location in a later step. For more "
"information on ``keytool`` usage, see `this Q&A article <https://godotengine."

"If you have an application with the same Android package name but a "
"different signing key already installed on the device, you **must** remove "

"Android again."
msgstr ""

msgid "Providing launcher icons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Launcher icons are used by Android launcher apps to represent your "
"application to users. Godot only requires high-resolution icons (for "
"``xxxhdpi`` density screens) and will automatically generate lower-"
"resolution variants."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are two types of icons required by Godot:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Main Icon:** The \"classic\" icon. This will be used on all Android "
"versions up to Android 8 (Oreo), exclusive. Must be at least 192×192 px."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Adaptive Icons:** Starting from Android 8 (inclusive), `Adaptive Icons "
"<https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/"
"icon_design_adaptive>`_ were introduced. Applications will need to include "
"separate background and foreground icons to have a native look. The user's "
"launcher application will control the icon's animation and masking. Must be "
"at least 432×432 px."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's important to adhere to some rules when designing adaptive icons. "
"`Google Design has provided a nice article <https://medium.com/google-design/"
"designing-adaptive-icons-515af294c783>`_ that helps to understand those "
"rules and some of the capabilities of adaptive icons."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The most important adaptive icon design rule is to have your icon critical "
"elements inside the safe zone: a centered circle with a diameter of 66dp "
"(264 pixels on ``xxxhdpi``) to avoid being clipped by the launcher."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't provide some of the requested icons, Godot will replace them "
"using a fallback chain, trying the next in line when the current one fails:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Main Icon:** Provided main icon -> Project icon -> Default Godot main icon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Adaptive Icon Foreground:** Provided foreground icon -> Provided main icon "
"-> Project icon -> Default Godot foreground icon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Adaptive Icon Background:** Provided background icon -> Default Godot "
"background icon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's highly recommended to provide all the requested icons with their "
"specified resolutions. This way, your application will look great on all "
"Android devices and versions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exporting for Google Play Store"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Uploading an APK to Google's Play Store requires you to sign using a non-"
"debug keystore file; such file can be generated like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This keystore and key are used to verify your developer identity, remember "
"the password and keep it in a safe place! Use Google's Android Developer "
"guides to learn more about `APK signing <https://developer.android.com/"
"studio/publish/app-signing>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now fill in the following forms in your Android Export Presets:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Release:** Enter the path to the keystore file you just generated."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Release User:** Replace with the key alias."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Release Password:** Key password. Note that the keystore password and the "
"key password currently have to be the same."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Your export_presets.cfg file now contains sensitive information.** If you "
"use a version control system, you should remove it from public repositories "
"and add it to your ``.gitignore`` file or equivalent."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don't forget to uncheck the **Export With Debug** checkbox while exporting."
msgstr ""

msgid "Optimizing the APK size"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the APK will contain native libraries for both ARMv7 and ARMv8 "
"architectures. This increases its size significantly. To create a smaller "
"APK, uncheck either **Armeabi-v 7a** or **Arm 64 -v 8a** in your project's "
"Android export preset. This will create an APK that only contains a library "
"for a single architecture. Note that applications targeting ARMv7 can also "
"run on ARMv8 devices, but the opposite is not true."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since August 2019, Google Play requires all applications to be available in "
"64-bit form. This means you cannot upload an APK that contains *just* an "
"ARMv7 library. To solve this, you can upload several APKs to Google Play "
"using its `Multiple APK support <https://developer.android.com/google/play/"
"publishing/multiple-apks>`__. Each APK should target a single architecture; "
"creating an APK for ARMv7 and ARMv8 is usually sufficient to cover most "
"devices in use today."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can optimize the size further by compiling an Android export template "
"with only the features you need. See :ref:`doc_optimizing_for_size` for more "
"information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Troubleshooting rendering issues"
msgstr "Řešení problémů s vykreslováním"

msgid ""
"To improve out-of-the-box performance on mobile devices, Godot automatically "
"uses low-end-friendly settings by default on both Android and iOS."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can cause rendering issues that do not occur when running the project "
"on a desktop platform. See :ref:`doc_mobile_rendering_limitations` for more "
"information."
