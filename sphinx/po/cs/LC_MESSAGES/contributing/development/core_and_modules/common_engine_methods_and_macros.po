msgid "Common engine methods and macros"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's C++ codebase makes use of dozens of custom methods and macros which "
"are used in almost every file. This page is geared towards beginner "
"contributors, but it can also be useful for those writing custom C++ modules."
msgstr ""

msgid "Print text"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to add placeholders in your messages, use format strings as "
"described below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Format a string"
msgstr "Formátování řetězce"

msgid ""
"The ``vformat()`` function returns a formatted :ref:`class_String`. It "
"behaves in a way similar to C's ``sprintf()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases, try to use ``vformat()`` instead of string concatenation as "
"it makes for more readable code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Convert an integer or float to a string"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is not needed when printing numbers using ``print_line()``, but you may "
"still need to perform manual conversion for some other use cases."
msgstr ""

msgid "Internationalize a string"
msgstr "Internacionalizace řetězce"

msgid "There are two types of internationalization in Godot's codebase:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``TTR()``: **Editor (\"tools\") translations** will only be processed in the "
"editor. If a user uses the same text in one of their projects, it won't be "
"translated if they provide a translation for it. When contributing to the "
"engine, this is generally the macro you should use for localizable strings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``RTR()``: **Run-time translations** will be automatically localized in "
"projects if they provide a translation for the given string. This kind of "
"translation shouldn't be used in editor-only code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To insert placeholders in localizable strings, wrap the localization macro "
"in a ``vformat()`` call as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using ``vformat()`` and a translation macro together, always wrap the "
"translation macro in ``vformat()``, not the other way around. Otherwise, the "
"string will never match the translation as it will have the placeholder "
"already replaced when it's passed to TranslationServer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Clamp a value"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides macros for clamping a value with a lower bound (``MAX``), an "
"upper bound (``MIN``) or both (``CLAMP``):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This works with any type that can be compared to other values (like ``int`` "
"and ``float``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Microbenchmarking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to benchmark a piece of code but don't know how to use a "
"profiler, use this snippet:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will print the time spent between the ``begin`` declaration and the "
"``end`` declaration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may have to ``#include \"core/os/os.h\"`` if it's not present already."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When opening a pull request, make sure to remove this snippet as well as the "
"include if it wasn't there previously."
msgstr ""

msgid "Get project/editor settings"
msgstr "Získejte nastavení projektu / editoru"

msgid "There are four macros available for this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a default value has been specified elsewhere, don't specify it again to "
"avoid repetition:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's recommended to use ``GLOBAL_DEF``/``EDITOR_DEF`` only once per setting "
"and use ``GLOBAL_GET``/``EDITOR_GET`` in all other places where it's "
"referenced."
msgstr ""

msgid "Error macros"
msgstr "Chybová makra"

msgid ""
"Godot features many error macros to make error reporting more convenient."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Conditions in error macros work in the **opposite** way of GDScript's built-"
"in ``assert()`` function. An error is reached if the condition inside "
"evaluates to ``true``, not ``false``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only variants with custom messages are documented here, as these should "
"always be used in new contributions. Make sure the custom message provided "
"includes enough information for people to diagnose the issue, even if they "
"don't know C++. In case a method was passed invalid arguments, you can print "
"the invalid value in question to ease debugging."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For internal error checking where displaying a human-readable message isn't "
"necessary, remove ``_MSG`` at the end of the macro name and don't supply a "
"message argument."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, always try to return processable data so the engine can keep running "
"well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See `core/error/error_macros.h <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/"
"master/core/error/error_macros.h>`__ in Godot's codebase for more "
"information about each error macro."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some functions return an error code (materialized by a return type of "
"``Error``). This value can be returned directly from an error macro. See the "
"list of available error codes in `core/error/error_list.h <https://github."
"com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/error/error_list.h>`__."
