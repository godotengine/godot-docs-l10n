msgid ""
"This document is here to help us assess what we should include in the "
"official documentation. Below, you will find a couple of principles and "
"recommendations to write accessible content."
msgstr ""

msgid "We want to achieve two goals:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Empathize with our users.** We should write in a way that makes it easy "
"for them to learn from the docs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Write a complete reference manual**. Our goal here is not to teach "
"programming foundations. Instead, we should provide a reference for how "
"Godot's features work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Guidelines and principles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Below are the guidelines we should strive to follow. They are not hard "
"rules, though: exceptionally, a topic will require breaking one or more of "
"these. Still, we should strive to achieve the two goals listed above."
msgstr ""

msgid "Writing complete and accessible documentation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**A feature doesn't exist unless it is documented**. If a user can't find "
"information about a feature and how it works, it doesn't exist to them. We "
"should ensure that we cover everything Godot does."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When adding or updating an engine feature, the documentation team needs to "
"know about it. Contributors should open an issue on the `godot-docs` "
"repository when their work gets merged and requires documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do your best to keep documents **under 1000 words in length**. If a page "
"goes past that threshold, consider splitting it into two parts if possible. "
"Limiting page size forces us to write concisely and to break large documents "
"so they each focus on a particular problem."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make it clear what **problem** each page or section of a page tackles and "
"what the user will learn from it. Users need to know if they're reading the "
"correct guide to solving problems they encounter. For example, instead of "
"writing the heading \"Signals\", consider writing \"Reacting to changes with "
"signals\". The second title makes it clear what the purpose of signals is."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Long section titles lead to long entries in the side menu, which can make "
"navigation cumbersome. Try to keep headings five words long or less."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the page assumes specific knowledge of other Godot features, mention it "
"and link it to the corresponding documentation. For instance, a page about "
"physics may use signals, in which case we could note that the page that "
"introduces signals is a pre-requisite."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limiting cognitive load"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Limit the cognitive load required to read the documentation. The simpler and "
"more explicit language we use, the more efficient it becomes for people to "
"learn. You can do so by:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Introducing only one new concept at a time whenever possible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using simple English, as we recommend in our writing guidelines."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Including one or more **concrete usage examples**. Prefer a real-world "
"example to abstract code like ``foobar``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While many people may understand more complex language and abstract "
"examples, you will lose others. Also, understandable writing and practical "
"examples benefit everyone."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Always make an effort to **put yourself in the user's shoes**. When we "
"understand something thoroughly, it becomes evident to us. We may fail to "
"think about details relevant to a newcomer, but **good documentation meets "
"users where they are**. We should strive to explain each feature's "
"capabilities or intended uses with the most straightforward language "
"possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Try to remember what you first needed to know when learning about the "
"feature or concept. What new terms did you need to learn? What confused you? "
"What was the hardest to grasp? You will want users to review your work, and "
"we recommend you practice explaining the feature before writing about it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Having programming foundations is a pre-requisite to use a complex engine "
"like Godot. Talking about variables, functions, or classes is acceptable. "
"But we should favor plain language over specific terminology like "
"\"metaprogramming\". If you need to use precise terms, be sure to define "
"them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a page assumes knowledge of another engine feature, declare it at the "
"beginning and link to resources that cover what users need. You may also "
"link to other websites for pre-requisites beyond the documentation's scope. "
"For example, you could link to an introduction to programming in the getting "
"started guide, or a website that teaches math theory in the math section."
