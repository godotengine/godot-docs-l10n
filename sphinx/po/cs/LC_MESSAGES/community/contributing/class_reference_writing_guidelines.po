"built-in node types."

"To learn to submit your changes to the Godot project using the Git version "

"The reference for each class is contained in an XML file like the one below:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It starts with brief and long descriptions. In the generated docs, the brief "
"description is always at the top of the page, while the long description "
"lies below the list of methods, variables, and constants. You can find "
"methods, member variables, constants, and signals in separate XML nodes."

"Write in a clear and simple language. Always follow the :ref:`writing "

msgid "How to edit class XML"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Edit the file for your chosen class in ``doc/classes/`` to update the class "
"reference. The folder contains an XML file for each class. The XML lists the "
"constants and methods you will find in the class reference. Godot generates "
"and updates the XML automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For some modules in the engine's source code, you'll find the XML files in "
"the ``modules/<module_name>/doc_classes/`` directory instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Edit it using your favorite text editor. If you use a code editor, make sure "
"that it doesn't change the indent style: you should use tabs for the XML and "
"four spaces inside BBCode-style blocks. More on that below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check that the modifications you've made are correct in the generated "
"documentation, navigate to the ``doc/`` folder and run the command ``make "
"rst``. This will convert the XML files to the online documentation's format "
"and output errors if anything's wrong."

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can build Godot and open the modified page in the built-"
"in code reference. To learn how to compile the engine, read the :ref:"
"`compilation guide <toc-devel-compiling>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We recommend using a code editor that supports XML files like Vim, Atom, "
"Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, or another to comfortably edit the file. You "
"can also use their search feature to find classes and properties quickly."
