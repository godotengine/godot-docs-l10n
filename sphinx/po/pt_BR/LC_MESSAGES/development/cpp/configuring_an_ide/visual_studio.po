"You can launch the project with the debugger attached using the **Debug > "
"Start Debugging** option from the top menu. However, unless you want to "
"debug the project manager specifically, you'd need to configure debugging "
"options first. This is due to the fact that when the Godot project manager "
"opens a project, the initial process is terminated and the debugger gets "
"detached."

"Open the **Debugging** section and under **Command Arguments** add two new "
"arguments: the ``-e`` flag opens the editor instead of the project manager, "

"``project.godot`` file)."
