msgid "Requirements"
msgstr "Requisitos"

msgid "For compiling under Windows, the following is required:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Visual Studio Community <https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/>`_, "
"version 2017 or later. VS 2019 is recommended. **Make sure to read "
"\"Installing Visual Studio caveats\" below or you will have to run/download "
"the installer again.**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`MinGW-w64 <http://mingw-w64.org/>`__ with GCC can be used as an alternative "
"to Visual Studio. Be sure to install/configure it to use the ``posix`` "
"thread model."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Python 3.5+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_. **Make sure to "
"enable the option to add Python to the ``PATH`` in the installer.**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`SCons <https://www.scons.org/>`_ build system. Using the latest release is "
"recommended, especially for proper support of recent Visual Studio releases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have `Scoop <https://scoop.sh/>`_ installed, you can easily install "
"MinGW and other dependencies using the following command::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have `MSYS2 <https://www.msys2.org/>`_ installed, you can easily "
"install MinGW and other dependencies using the following command::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For each MSYS2 MinGW subsystem, you should then run `pip3 install scons` in "
"its shell."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get the Godot source code for compiling, see :ref:`doc_getting_source`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a general overview of SCons usage for Godot, see :ref:"

msgid "Setting up SCons"
msgstr "Configurando SCons"

msgid ""
"To install SCons, open the command prompt and run the following command::"
msgstr ""
"Para instalar o SCons, abra o prompt de comando e execute o seguinte comando:"

msgid ""
"If you are prompted with the message ``Defaulting to user installation "
"because normal site-packages is not writeable``, you may have to run that "
"command again using elevated permissions. Open a new command prompt as an "
"Administrator then run the command again to ensure that SCons is available "
"from the ``PATH``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check whether you have installed Python and SCons correctly, you can type "
"``python --version`` and ``scons --version`` into a command prompt (``cmd."
"exe``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the commands above don't work, make sure to add Python to your ``PATH`` "
"environment variable after installing it, then check again. You can do so by "
"running the Python installer again and enabling the option to add Python to "
"the ``PATH``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If SCons cannot detect your Visual Studio installation, it might be that "
"your SCons version is too old. Update it to the latest version with ``python "
"-m pip install --upgrade scons``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing Visual Studio caveats"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If installing Visual Studio 2017 or 2019, make sure to enable **C++** in the "
"list of workflows to install."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If installing Visual Studio 2015, make sure to run a **Custom** installation "
"instead of **Typical** and select **C++** as a language there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you've already made the mistake of installing Visual Studio without C++ "
"support, run the installer again; it should present you a **Modify** button. "
"Running the installer from *Add/Remove Programs* will only give you a "
"**Repair** option, which won't let you install C++ tools."

msgid ""
"To prevent slowdowns caused by continuous virus scanning during compilation, "
"add the Godot source folder to the list of exceptions in your antivirus "
"software."

"For Windows Defender, hit the :kbd:`Windows` key, type \"Windows Defender "
"Settings\" then hit :kbd:`Enter`. Under **Virus & threat protection**, go to "

msgid "Selecting a compiler"
msgstr "Selecionando um compilador"

msgid ""
"SCons will automatically find and use an existing Visual Studio "
"installation. If you do not have Visual Studio installed, it will attempt to "
"use MinGW instead. If you already have Visual Studio installed and want to "
"use MinGW, pass ``use_mingw=yes`` to the SCons command line. Note that MSVC "
"builds cannot be performed from the MSYS2 or MinGW shells. Use either ``cmd."
"exe`` or PowerShell instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During development, using the Visual Studio compiler is usually a better "
"idea, as it links the Godot binary much faster than MinGW. However, MinGW "
"can produce more optimized binaries using link-time optimization (see "
"below), making it a better choice for production use."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running SCons"
msgstr "Executando SCons"

msgid ""
"After opening a command prompt, change to the root directory of the engine "
"source code (using ``cd``) and type::"

msgid ""
"When compiling with multiple CPU threads, SCons may warn about pywin32 being "
"missing. You can safely ignore this warning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If all goes well, the resulting binary executable will be placed in ``C:"
"\\godot\\bin\\`` with the name ``godot.windows.tools.32.exe`` or ``godot."
"windows.tools.64.exe``. By default, SCons will build a binary matching your "
"CPU architecture, but this can be overridden using ``bits=64`` or "
"``bits=32``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This executable file contains the whole engine and runs without any "
"dependencies. Running it will bring up the Project Manager."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are compiling Godot for production use, then you can make the final "
"executable smaller and faster by adding the SCons option "
"``target=release_debug``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are compiling Godot with MinGW, you can make the binary even smaller "
"and faster by adding the SCons option ``use_lto=yes``. As link-time "
"optimization is a memory-intensive process, this will require about 7 GB of "
"available RAM while compiling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to use separate editor settings for your own Godot builds and "
"official releases, you can enable :ref:`doc_data_paths_self_contained_mode` "
"by creating a file called ``._sc_`` or ``_sc_`` in the ``bin/`` folder."

msgid "Development in Visual Studio"
msgstr "Desenvolvimento no Visual Studio"

msgid ""
"Using an IDE is not required to compile Godot, as SCons takes care of "
"everything. But if you intend to do engine development or debugging of the "
"engine's C++ code, you may be interested in configuring a code editor or an "
"IDE."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Folder-based editors don't require any particular setup to start working "
"with Godot's codebase. To edit projects with Visual Studio they need to be "
"set up as a solution."

msgid ""
"You can create a Visual Studio solution via SCons by running SCons with the "
"``vsproj=yes`` parameter, like this::"

"You will be able to open Godot's source in a Visual Studio solution now, and "
"able to build Godot using Visual Studio's **Build** button."
