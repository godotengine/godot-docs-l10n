msgid "Overview of Godot's key concepts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every game engine revolves around abstractions you use to build your "
"applications. In Godot, a game is a **tree** of **nodes** that you group "
"together into **scenes**. You can then wire these nodes so they can "
"communicate using **signals**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These are the four concepts you will learn here. We're going to look at them "
"briefly to give you a sense of how the engine works. In the getting started "
"series, you will get to use them in practice."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scenes"
msgstr "Cenas"

msgid ""
"In Godot, you break down your game in reusable scenes. A scene can be a "
"character, a weapon, a menu in the user interface, a single house, an entire "
"level, or anything you can think of. Godot's scenes are flexible; they fill "
"the role of both prefabs and scenes in some other game engines."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also nest scenes. For example, you can put your character in a "
"level, and drag and drop a scene as a child of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nodes"
msgstr "Nós"

msgid ""
"A scene is composed of one or more **nodes**. Nodes are your game's smallest "
"building blocks that you arrange into trees. Here's an example of a "
"character's nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is made of a ``KinematicBody2D`` node named \"Character\", a ``Sprite``, "
"a ``Camera2D``, and a ``CollisionShape2D``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The node names end with \"2D\" because this is a 2D scene. Their 3D "
"counterpart have names that end with \"3D\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice how nodes and scenes look the same in the editor. When you save a "
"tree of nodes as a scene, it then shows as a single node, with its internal "
"structure hidden in the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides an extensive library of base node types you can combine and "
"extend to build more powerful ones. 2D, 3D, or user interface, you will do "
"most things with these nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid "The scene tree"
msgstr "A árvore da cena"

msgid ""
"All your game's scenes come together in the **scene tree**, literally a tree "
"of scenes. And as scenes are trees of nodes, the scene tree also is a tree "
"of nodes. But it's easier to think of your game in terms of scenes as they "
"can represent characters, weapons, doors, or your user interface."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signals"
msgstr "Sinais"

msgid ""
"Nodes emit signals when some event occurs. This feature allows you to make "
"nodes communicate without hard-wiring them in code. It gives you a lot of "
"flexibility in how you structure your scenes."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Signals are Godot's version of the *observer* pattern. You can read more "
"about it here: https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html"
msgstr ""
"Você pode ler mais sobre o padrão observador aqui: http://"
"gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html"

msgid ""
"For example, buttons emit a signal when pressed. You can connect to this "
"signal to run code in reaction to this event, like starting the game or "
"opening a menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Other built-in signals can tell you when two objects collided, when a "
"character or monster entered a given area, and much more. You can also "
"define new signals tailored to your game."
msgstr ""

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "Resumo"

msgid ""
"Nodes, scenes, the scene tree, and signals are four core concepts in Godot "
"that you will manipulate all the time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Nodes are your game's smallest building blocks. You combine them to create "
"scenes that you then combine and nest into the scene tree. You can then use "
"signals to make nodes react to events in other nodes or different scene tree "
"branches."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After this short breakdown, you probably have many questions. Bear with us "
"as you will get many answers throughout the getting started series."
