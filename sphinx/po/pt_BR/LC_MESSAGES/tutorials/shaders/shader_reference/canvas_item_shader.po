"CanvasItem shaders are used to draw all 2D elements in Godot. These include "
"all nodes that inherit from CanvasItems, and all GUI elements."

msgid ""
"CanvasItem shaders contain less built-in variables and functionality than "
"Spatial shaders, but they maintain the same basic structure with vertex, "

"This differs from the behavior of the built-in normal map. If a normal map "
