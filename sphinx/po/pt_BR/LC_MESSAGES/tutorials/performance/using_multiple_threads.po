"Threads allow simultaneous execution of code. It allows off-loading work "
"from the main thread."

msgid "Godot supports threads and provides many handy functions to use them."

"If using other languages (C#, C++), it may be easier to use the threading "
"classes they support."

"Before using a built-in class in a thread, read :ref:`doc_thread_safe_apis` "
"first to check whether it can be safely used in a thread."

msgid "To create a thread, use the following code:"
msgstr "Para habilitar uma interface, você executa o seguinte código:"

msgid ""
"Your function will, then, run in a separate thread until it returns. Even if "
"the function has returned already, the thread must collect it, so call :ref:"
"`Thread.wait_to_finish()<class_Thread_method_wait_to_finish>`, which will "
"wait until the thread is done (if not done yet), then properly dispose of it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creating threads at run-time is slow on Windows and should be avoided to "
"prevent stuttering. Semaphores, explained later on this page, should be used "
"instead."

msgstr "Mutexes"

msgid ""
"Accessing objects or data from multiple threads is not always supported (if "
"you do it, it will cause unexpected behaviors or crashes). Read the :ref:"
"`doc_thread_safe_apis` documentation to understand which engine APIs support "
"multiple thread access."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When processing your own data or calling your own functions, as a rule, try "
"to avoid accessing the same data directly from different threads. You may "
"run into synchronization problems, as the data is not always updated between "
"CPU cores when modified. Always use a :ref:`Mutex<class_Mutex>` when "
"accessing a piece of data from different threads."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When calling :ref:`Mutex.lock()<class_Mutex_method_lock>`, a thread ensures "
"that all other threads will be blocked (put on suspended state) if they try "
"to *lock* the same mutex. When the mutex is unlocked by calling :ref:`Mutex."
"unlock()<class_Mutex_method_unlock>`, the other threads will be allowed to "
"proceed with the lock (but only one at a time)."

"Sometimes you want your thread to work *\"on demand\"*. In other words, tell "
"it when to work and let it suspend when it isn't doing anything. For this, :"
"ref:`Semaphores<class_Semaphore>` are used. The function :ref:`Semaphore."
"wait()<class_Semaphore_method_wait>` is used in the thread to suspend it "
"until some data arrives."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The main thread, instead, uses :ref:`Semaphore."
"post()<class_Semaphore_method_post>` to signal that data is ready to be "
