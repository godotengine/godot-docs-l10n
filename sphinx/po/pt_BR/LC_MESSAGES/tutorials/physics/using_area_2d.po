"Godot offers a number of collision objects to provide both collision "
"detection and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your project "
"can be confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if you "
"understand how each of them works and what their pros and cons are. In this "
"tutorial, we'll look at the :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` node and show some "
"examples of how it can be used."

"A Godot oferece uma série de objetos de colisão para proporcionar tanto a "
"detecção de colisão quanto a resposta. Tentar decidir qual deles usar para "
"seu projeto pode ser confuso. Você pode evitar problemas e simplificar o "
"desenvolvimento se entender como cada um deles funciona e quais são seus "
"prós e contras. Neste tutorial, veremos o nó :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` e "
"mostraremos alguns exemplos de como ele pode ser utilizado."

msgid ""
"This document assumes you're familiar with Godot's various physics bodies. "
"Please read :ref:`doc_physics_introduction` first."

msgid "What is an area?"
msgstr "O que é uma área?"

msgid ""
"An Area2D defines a region of 2D space. In this space you can detect other :"
"ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` nodes overlapping, "
"entering, and exiting. Areas also allow for overriding local physics "
"properties. We'll explore each of these functions below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Area properties"
msgstr "Propriedades da área"

msgid "Areas have many properties you can use to customize their behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first eight properties are used to configure the area's physics override "
"behavior. We'll look at how to use those in the section below."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Monitoring* and *Monitorable* are used to enable and disable the area."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"Collision\" section is where you configure the area's collision "
"layer(s) and mask(s)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"Audio Bus\" section allows you to override audio in the area, for "
"example to apply an audio effect when the player moves through."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that Area2D extends :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, "
"so it also provides properties inherited from that class, such as "
"``input_pickable``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Overlap detection"
msgstr "Detecção de sobreposição"

msgid ""
"Perhaps the most common use of Area2D nodes is for contact and overlap "
"detection. When you need to know that two objects have touched, but don't "
"need physical collision, you can use an area to notify you of the contact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, let's say we're making a coin for the player to pick up. The "
"coin is not a solid object - the player can't stand on it or push it - we "
"just want it to disappear when the player touches it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's the node setup for the coin:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To detect the overlap, we'll connect the appropriate signal on the Area2d. "
"Which signal to use depends on the player's node type. If the player is "
"another area, use ``area_entered``. However, let's assume our player is a "
"``KinematicBody2D`` (and therefore a ``CollisionObject2D`` type), so we'll "
"connect the ``body_entered`` signal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're not familiar with using signals, see :ref:`doc_signals` for an "
"introduction."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now our player can collect the coins!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some other usage examples:"
msgstr "Alguns outros exemplos de uso:"

msgid ""
"Areas are great for bullets and other projectiles that hit and deal damage, "
"but don't need any other physics such as bouncing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use a large circular area around an enemy to define its \"detect\" radius. "
"When the player is outside the area, the enemy can't \"see\" it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"Security cameras\" - In a large level with multiple cameras, attach areas "
"to each camera and activate them when the player enters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game` for an example of using Area2D in a "
"game."
msgstr ""
"Veja o :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game` para um exemplo de utilização da Area2D "
"em um jogo."

msgid "Area influence"
msgstr "Área de influência"

msgid ""
"The second major use for area nodes is to alter physics. By default, the "
"area won't do this, but you can enable this with the *Space Override* "
"property. When areas overlap, they are processed in *Priority* order (higher "
"priority areas are processed first). There are four options for override:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Combine* - The area adds its values to what has been calculated so far."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Replace* - The area replaces physics properties, and lower priority areas "
"are ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Combine-Replace* - The area adds its gravity/damping values to whatever has "
"been calculated so far (in priority order), ignoring any lower priority "
"areas."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Replace-Combine* - The area replaces any gravity/damping calculated so far, "
"but keeps calculating the rest of the areas."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using these properties, you can create very complex behavior with multiple "
"overlapping areas."
msgstr ""

msgid "The physics properties that can be overridden are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Gravity* - Gravity's strength inside the area."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Gravity Vec* - Gravity's direction. This vector does not need to be "
"normalized."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Linear Damp* - How quickly objects stop moving - linear velocity lost per "
"second."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Angular Damp* - How quickly objects stop spinning - angular velocity lost "
"per second."
msgstr ""

msgid "Point gravity"
msgstr "Ponto de gravidade"

msgid ""
"The *Gravity Point* property allows you to create an \"attractor\". Gravity "
"in the area will be calculated towards a point, given by the *Gravity Vec* "
"property. Values are relative to the Area2D, so for example using ``(0, 0)`` "
"will attract objects to the center of the area."
msgstr ""

"The example project attached below has three areas demonstrating physics "
"override."
