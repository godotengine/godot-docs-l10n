msgid "What is a rigid body?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A rigid body is one that is directly controlled by the physics engine in "
"order to simulate the behavior of physical objects. In order to define the "
"shape of the body, it must have one or more :ref:`Shape <class_Shape>` "
"objects assigned. Note that setting the position of these shapes will affect "
"the body's center of mass."

msgid "How to control a rigid body"

msgid ""
"A rigid body's behavior can be altered by setting its properties, such as "
"mass and weight. A physics material needs to be added to the rigid body to "
"adjust its friction and bounce, and set if it's absorbent and/or rough. "
"These properties can be set in the Inspector or via code. See :ref:"
"`RigidBody <class_RigidBody>` and :ref:`PhysicsMaterial "
"<class_PhysicsMaterial>` for the full list of properties and their effects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are several ways to control a rigid body's movement, depending on your "
"desired application."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you only need to place a rigid body once, for example to set its initial "
"location, you can use the methods provided by the :ref:`Spatial "
"<class_Spatial>` node, such as ``set_global_transform()`` or ``look_at()``. "
"However, these methods cannot be called every frame or the physics engine "
"will not be able to correctly simulate the body's state. As an example, "
"consider a rigid body that you want to rotate so that it points towards "
"another object. A common mistake when implementing this kind of behavior is "
"to use ``look_at()`` every frame, which breaks the physics simulation. "
"Below, we'll demonstrate how to implement this correctly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The fact that you can't use ``set_global_transform()`` or ``look_at()`` "
"methods doesn't mean that you can't have full control of a rigid body. "
"Instead, you can control it by using the ``_integrate_forces()`` callback. "
"In this method, you can add *forces*, apply *impulses*, or set the "
"*velocity* in order to achieve any movement you desire."
msgstr ""

msgid "The \"look at\" method"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As described above, using the Spatial node's ``look_at()`` method can't be "
"used each frame to follow a target. Here is a custom ``look_at()`` method "
"that will work reliably with rigid bodies:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method uses the rigid body's ``set_angular_velocity()`` method to "
"rotate the body. It first calculates the difference between the current and "
"desired angle and then adds the velocity needed to rotate by that amount in "
"one frame's time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This script will not work with rigid bodies in *character mode* because "
"then, the body's rotation is locked. In that case, you would have to rotate "
"the attached mesh node instead using the standard Spatial methods."
