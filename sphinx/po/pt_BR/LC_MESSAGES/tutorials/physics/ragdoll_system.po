msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Introdução"

msgid ""
"Since version 3.1, Godot supports ragdoll physics. Ragdolls rely on physics "
"simulation to create realistic procedural animation. They are used for death "
"animations in many games."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this tutorial, we will be using the Platformer3D demo to set up a ragdoll."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can download the Platformer3D demo on `GitHub <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/3d/platformer>`_ or using the "
"`Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/125>`_."

msgid "Setting up the ragdoll"
msgstr "Configurando o ragdoll"

msgid "Creating physical bones"
msgstr "Criando ossos físicos"

msgid ""
"Like many other features in the engine, there is a node to set up a ragdoll: "
"the :ref:`PhysicalBone3D <class_PhysicalBone3D>` node. To simplify the "
"setup, you can generate ``PhysicalBone`` nodes with the \"Create physical "
"skeleton\" feature in the skeleton node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open the platformer demo in Godot, and then the Robi scene. Select the "
"``Skeleton`` node. A skeleton button appears on the top bar menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click it and select the ``Create physical skeleton`` option. Godot will "
"generate ``PhysicalBone`` nodes and collision shapes for each bone in the "
"skeleton and pin joints to connect them together:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of the generated bones aren't necessary: the ``MASTER`` bone for "
"example. So we're going to clean up the skeleton by removing them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cleaning up the skeleton"
msgstr "Limpando o esqueleto"

msgid ""
"Each ``PhysicalBone`` the engine needs to simulate has a performance cost, "
"so you want to remove every bone that is too small to make a difference in "
"the simulation, as well as all utility bones."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, if we take a humanoid, you do not want to have physical bones "
"for each finger. You can use a single bone for the entire hand instead, or "
"one for the palm, one for the thumb, and a last one for the other four "
"fingers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remove these physical bones: ``MASTER``, ``waist``, ``neck``, "
"``headtracker``. This gives us an optimized skeleton and makes it easier to "
"control the ragdoll."
msgstr ""

msgid "Collision shape adjustment"
msgstr "Ajuste da forma de colisão"

msgid ""
"The next task is adjusting the collision shape and the size of physical "
"bones to match the part of the body that each bone should simulate."
msgstr ""
"A próxima tarefa é ajustar a forma de colisão e o tamanho dos ossos físicos "
"para corresponder à parte do corpo que cada osso deve simular."

msgid "Joints adjustment"
msgstr "Ajuste das articulações"

msgid ""
"Once you adjusted the collision shapes, your ragdoll is almost ready. You "
"just want to adjust the pin joints to get a better simulation. "
"``PhysicalBone`` nodes have an unconstrained pin joint assigned to them by "
"default. To change the pin joint, select the ``PhysicalBone`` and change the "
"constraint type in the ``Joint`` section. There, you can change the "
"constraint's orientation and its limits."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the final result:"
msgstr "Este é o resultado final:"

msgid "Simulating the ragdoll"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ragdoll is now ready to use. To start the simulation and play the "
"ragdoll animation, you need to call the ``physical_bones_start_simulation`` "
"method. Attach a script to the skeleton node and call the method in the "
"``_ready`` method:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To stop the simulation, call the ``physical_bones_stop_simulation()`` method."
msgstr ""
"Para parar a simulação, chame o método ``physical_bones_stop_simulation()``."

msgid ""
"You can also limit the simulation to only a few bones. To do so, pass the "
"bone names as a parameter. Here's an example of partial ragdoll simulation:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Collision layer and mask"
msgstr "Camadas e Máscaras de colisão"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Make sure to set up your collision layers and masks properly so the "
"``CharacterBody3D``'s capsule doesn't get in the way of the physics "
"simulation:"
msgstr ""
"Tenha certeza que as propriedades físicas de mascaras e camadas estejam "
"corretas para que a capsula do ``KinematicBody`` não atrapalhe as simulações "
"físicas:"
