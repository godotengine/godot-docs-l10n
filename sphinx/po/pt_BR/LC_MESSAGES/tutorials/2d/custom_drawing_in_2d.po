"Basically, drawing a shape on the screen requires it to be decomposed into a "
"certain number of points linked from one to the next. As you can imagine, "
"the more points your shape is made of, the smoother it will appear, but the "
"heavier it will also be in terms of processing cost. In general, if your "
"shape is huge (or in 3D, close to the camera), it will require more points "
"to be drawn without it being angular-looking. On the contrary, if your shape "
"is small (or in 3D, far from the camera), you may decrease its number of "
"points to save processing costs; this is known as *Level of Detail (LOD)*. "
"In our example, we will simply use a fixed number of points, no matter the "

"imaginar, quanto mais pontos sua forma for feita, mais lisa ela aparecerá, "
"mas mais pesada também será em termos de custo de processamento. Em geral, "
"se sua forma for enorme (ou em 3D, perto da câmera), será necessário que "
"mais pontos sejam desenhados sem ter uma aparência angular. Ao contrário, se "
"o seu formato for pequeno (ou em 3D, longe da câmera), você pode diminuir o "
"número de pontos para economizar custos de processamento; isso é conhecido "

"The next step consists of computing the actual positions of these 32 points "

"The reason why each angle is decreased by 90° is that we will compute 2D "
"positions out of each angle using trigonometry (you know, cosine and sine "
"stuff...). However, to be simple, ``cos()`` and ``sin()`` use radians, not "
"degrees. The angle of 0° (0 radian) starts at 3 o'clock, although we want to "
"start counting at 12 o'clock. So we decrease each angle by 90° in order to "

"The actual position of a point located on a circle at angle ``angle`` (in "
"radians) is given by ``Vector2(cos(angle), sin(angle))``. Since ``cos()`` "
"and ``sin()`` return values between -1 and 1, the position is located on a "
"circle of radius 1. To have this position on our support circle, which has a "
"radius of ``radius``, we simply need to multiply the position by ``radius``. "
"Finally, we need to position our support circle at the ``center`` position, "
"which is performed by adding it to our ``Vector2`` value. Finally, we insert "
"the point in the ``PoolVector2Array`` which was previously defined."

"Now, we need to actually draw our points. As you can imagine, we will not "
"simply draw our 32 points: we need to draw everything that is between each "
"of them. We could have computed every point ourselves using the previous "
"method, and drew it one by one. But this is too complicated and inefficient "
"(except if explicitly needed), so we simply draw lines between each pair of "
"points. Unless the radius of our support circle is big, the length of each "
"line between a pair of points will never be long enough to see them. If that "
"were to happen, we would simply need to increase the number of points."

"All right, we are now able to draw custom stuff on the screen. However, it "

"The reason is that your GPU is actually displaying the frames as fast as it "
"can. We need to \"normalize\" the drawing by this speed; to achieve that, we "
"have to make use of the ``delta`` parameter of the ``_process()`` function. "
"``delta`` contains the time elapsed between the two last rendered frames. It "
