"Every beginner has been there: \"How do I move my character?\" Depending on "

"In this scenario, you want the user to press the four directional keys (up/"
"left/down/right or W/A/S/D) and move in the selected direction. The name \"8-"
"way movement\" comes from the fact that the player can move diagonally by "
"pressing two keys at the same time."

"In the ``get_input()`` function we check for the four key events and sum "
"them up to get the velocity vector. This has the benefit of making two "
"opposite keys cancel each other out, but will also result in diagonal "
"movement being faster due to the two directions being added together."

"We can prevent that if we *normalize* the velocity, which means we set its "

"This type of movement is sometimes called \"Asteroids-style\" because it "
"resembles how that classic arcade game worked. Pressing left/right rotates "
"the character, while up/down moves it forward or backward in whatever "
"direction it's facing."

"Here we've added two new variables to track our rotation direction and "
"speed. Again, pressing both keys at once will cancel out and result in no "
"rotation. The rotation is applied directly to the body's ``rotation`` "
"property."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/2d/2d_movement.rst:204

"To set the velocity, we use the ``Vector2.rotated()`` method so that it "
"points in the same direction as the body. ``rotated()`` is a useful vector "
"function that you can use in many circumstances where you would otherwise "
"need to apply trigonometric functions."

"This style of movement is a variation of the previous one. This time, the "

"Note the ``length()`` check we make prior to movement. Without this test, "
"the body would \"jitter\" upon reaching the target position, as it moves "
"slightly past the position and tries to move back, only to move too far and "
"repeat."
