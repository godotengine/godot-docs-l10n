"In Godot, you can animate anything available in the Inspector, such as Node "

"To use the animation tools we first have to create an :ref:"

"The AnimationPlayer node type is the data container for your animations. One "

msgid ""
"The timeline and track controls, where you can zoom the timeline and edit "

msgstr ""

msgid "Computer animation relies on keyframes"
msgstr ""

msgid "A keyframe defines the value of a property at a certain point in time."

msgid ""
"Diamond shapes represent keyframes in the timeline. A line between two "

msgid "Keyframes in Godot"

msgid "Two keyframes are all it takes to obtain a smooth motion"

"The timeline lets you insert keyframes and change their timing. It also "

msgstr ""

msgid "The timeline in the animation panel"

"Each line of the Animation Panel is an animation track. Normal and Transform "

msgstr ""

msgid "Our scene setup"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"AnimationPlayer inherits from Node instead of Node2D or Spatial, which means "
"that the child nodes will not inherit the transform from the parent nodes "
"due to a bare Node being present in the hierarchy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Therefore, it is not recommended to add nodes that have a 2D/3D transform as "
"a child of an AnimationPlayer node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The sprite holds an image texture. We animate that sprite to move between "
"two points on the screen. For this tutorial, use the default Godot icon as "
"the sprite's texture. As a starting point, move the sprite to a left "
"position on the screen."
msgstr ""

"Godot has an additional feature here. Like said before, Godot always "

msgstr ""

msgid "Animation loop"

"Each track has a settings panel at the end, where you can set the update "

"The update mode of a track tells Godot when to update the property values. "
"This can be:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Continuous:** Update the property on each frame."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Discrete:** Only update the property on keyframes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Trigger:** Only update the property on keyframes or triggers. Triggers are "
"a type of keyframe used by the ``current_animation`` property of a :ref:"
"`class_AnimationPlayer`, and Animation Playback tracks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Capture:** If the first keyframe's time is greater than ``0.0``, the "
"current value of the property will be remembered and will be blended with "
"the first animation key. For example, you could use the Capture mode to move "
"a node that's located anywhere to a specific location."

msgid "Track mode"
msgstr "Modo de Ferramenta"

msgid ""
"In normal animations, you usually use \"Continuous\". The other types are "
"used to script complex animations."

msgid ""
"The interpolation tells Godot how to calculate the frame values between the "
"keyframes. These interpolation modes are supported:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Nearest: Set the nearest keyframe value"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Linear: Set the value based on a linear function calculation between the two "
"keyframes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cubic: Set the value based on a cubic function calculation between the two "
"keyframes"
msgstr ""

msgid "Track interpolation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cubic interpolation leads to a more natural movement, where the animation is "
"slower at a keyframe and faster between keyframes. This is usually used for "
"character animation. Linear interpolation creates more of a robotic movement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot supports two loop modes, which affect the animation if it's set to "
"loop:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Loop modes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Clamp loop interpolation: When this is selected, the animation stops after "
"the last keyframe for this track. When the first keyframe is reached again, "
"the animation will reset to its values."

"Wrap loop interpolation: When this is selected, Godot calculates the "
"animation after the last keyframe to reach the values of the first keyframe "
"again."
msgstr ""

msgid "Keyframes for other properties"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot doesn't restrict you to only edit transform properties. Every property "
"can be used as a track where you can set keyframes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select your sprite while the animation panel is visible, you get a "
"small keyframe button for all the sprite's properties. Click on this button "
"and Godot automatically adds a track and keyframe to the current animation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Edit keyframes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For advanced use and to edit keyframes in detail, You can click on them to "
"bring up the keyframe editor in the inspector. You can use this to directly "
"edit its values."
msgstr ""

msgid "Keyframe editor editing a key"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, you can also edit the easing value for this keyframe by "
"clicking and dragging the easing setting. This tells Godot, how to change "
"the property values when it reaches this keyframe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You usually tweak your animations this way, when the movement doesn't \"look "
"right\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advanced: Call Method tracks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's animation engine doesn't stop here. If you're already comfortable "
"with Godot's scripting language :ref:`doc_gdscript` and :doc:`/classes/"
"index` you know that each node type is a class and has a bunch of callable "
"methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the :ref:`class_AudioStreamPlayer` node type has a method to "
"play an audio stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wouldn't it be great to use a method at a specific keyframe in an animation? "
"This is where \"Call Method Tracks\" come in handy. These tracks reference a "
"node again, this time without a reference to a property. Instead, a keyframe "
"holds the name and arguments of a method, that Godot should call when it "
"reaches this keyframe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To demonstrate, we're going to use a call method track to play audio at a "
"specific keyframe. Normally to play audio you should use an audio track, but "
"for the sake of demonstrating methods we're going to do it this way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a :ref:`class_AudioStreamPlayer` to the Scene Tree and setup a stream "
"using an audio file you put in your project."

"Right click the timeline where Godot should play the sample and click the "
"\"Insert Key\" option. This will bring up a list of methods that can be "
"called for the AudioStreamPlayer node. Select the first one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When Godot reaches the keyframe, Godot calls the :ref:"
"`class_AudioStreamPlayer` node's \"play\" function and the stream plays."

msgid "Using RESET tracks"
msgstr "Usando Espaços"

msgid ""
"You can set up a special *RESET* animation to contain the \"default pose\". "
"This is used to ensure that the default pose is restored when you save the "
"scene and open it again in the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For existing tracks, you can add an animation called \"RESET\" (case-"
"sensitive), then add tracks for each property that you want to reset. The "
"only keyframe should be at time 0, and give it the desired default value for "
"each track."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If AnimationPlayer's **Reset On Save** property is set to ``true``, the "
"scene will be saved with the effects of the reset animation applied (as if "
"it had been seeked to time ``0.0``). This only affects the saved file – the "
"property tracks in the editor stay where they were."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to reset the tracks in the editor, select the AnimationPlayer "
"node, open the **Animation** bottom panel then choose **Apply Reset** in the "
"animation editor's **Animation** dropdown menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When adding tracks on new animations, the editor will ask you to "
"automatically create a RESET track when using the keyframe icon next to a "
"property in the inspector. This does not apply on tracks created with Godot "
"versions prior to 3.4, as the animation reset track feature was added in 3.4."
