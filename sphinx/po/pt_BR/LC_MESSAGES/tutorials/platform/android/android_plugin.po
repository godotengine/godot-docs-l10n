"While introduced in Godot 3.2, the Android plugin system got a significant "
"architecture update starting with Godot 3.2.2. The new plugin system is "
"backward-incompatible with the previous one, but both systems are kept "
"functional in future releases of the 3.2.x branch. Since we previously did "
"not version the Android plugin systems, the new one is now labelled ``v1`` "
"and is the starting point for the modern Godot Android ecosystem."
