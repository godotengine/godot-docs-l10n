msgid "Nodes and scene instances"
msgstr "Instâncias de nós e cenas"

msgid ""
"This guide explains how to get nodes, create nodes, add them as a child, and "
"instantiate scenes from code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Getting nodes"
msgstr "Obtendo nós"

msgid ""
"You can get a reference to a node by calling the :ref:`Node.get_node() "
"<class_Node_method_get_node>` method. For this to work, the child node must "
"be present in the scene tree. Getting it in the parent node's ``_ready()`` "
"function guarantees that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If, for example,  you have a scene tree like this, and you want to get a "
"reference to the Sprite and Camera2D nodes to access them in your script."
msgstr ""

msgid "To do so, you can use the following code."
msgstr "Para isso, você pode usar o seguinte código."

msgid ""
"Note that you get nodes using their name, not their type. Above, \"Sprite\" "
"and \"Camera2D\" are the nodes' names in the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you rename the Sprite node as Skin in the Scene dock, you have to change "
"the line that gets the node to ``get_node(\"Skin\")`` in the script."
msgstr ""

msgid "Node paths"
msgstr "Caminhos dos nós"

msgid ""
"When getting a reference to a node, you're not limited to getting a direct "
"child. The ``get_node()`` function supports paths, a bit like when working "
"with a file browser. Add a slash to separate nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Take the following example scene, with the script attached to the "
"UserInterface node."
msgstr ""

msgid "To get the Tween node, you would use the following code."
msgstr "Para obter o nó Tween, você usaria o código a seguir."

msgid ""
"As with file paths, you can use \"..\" to get a parent node. The best "
"practice is to avoid doing that though not to break encapsulation. You can "
"also start the path with a forward slash to make it absolute, in which case "
"your topmost node would be \"/root\", the application's predefined root "
"viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid "Syntactic sugar"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use two shorthands to shorten your code in GDScript. Firstly, "
"putting the ``onready`` keyword before a member variable makes it initialize "
"right before the ``_ready()`` callback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is also a short notation for ``get_node()``: the dollar sign, \"$\". "
"You place it before the name or path of the node you want to get."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating nodes"
msgstr "Criando nós"

msgid ""
"To create a node from code, call its ``new()`` method like for any other "
"class-based datatype."
msgstr ""
"Para criar um nó a partir do código, chame seu método ``new()`` como para "
"qualquer outro tipo de dados baseado em classe."

msgid ""
"You can store the newly created node's reference in a variable and call "
"``add_child()`` to add it as a child of the node to which you attached the "
"script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To delete a node and free it from memory, you can call its ``queue_free()`` "
"method. Doing so queues the node for deletion at the end of the current "
"frame after it has finished processing. At that point, the engine removes "
"the node from the scene and frees the object in memory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before calling ``sprite.queue_free()``, the remote scene tree looks like "
"this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the engine freed the node, the remote scene tree doesn't display the "
"sprite anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can alternatively call ``free()`` to immediately destroy the node. You "
"should do this with care as any reference to it will instantly become "
"``null``. We recommend using ``queue_free()`` unless you know what you're "
"doing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you free a node, it also frees all its children. Thanks to this, to "
"delete an entire branch of the scene tree, you only have to free the topmost "
"parent node."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instancing scenes"
msgstr "Criando instâncias de cenas"

msgid ""
"Scenes are templates from which you can create as many reproductions as "
"you'd like. This operation is called instancing, and doing it from code "
"happens in two steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Loading the scene from the hard drive."
msgstr "Carregando a cena salva no disco rígido."

msgid ""
"Creating an instance of the loaded :ref:`PackedScene <class_PackedScene>` "
"resource."
msgstr ""
"Criando uma instância do recurso carregado :ref:`PackedScene "
"<class_PackedScene>`."

msgid ""
"Preloading the scene can improve the user's experience as the load operation "
"happens when the compiler reads the script and not at runtime. This feature "
"is only available with GDScript."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At that point, ``scene`` is a packed scene resource, not a node. To create "
"the actual node, you need to call :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "
"<class_PackedScene_method_instance>`. It returns a tree of nodes that you "
"can as a child of your current node."
msgstr ""
"Nesse ponto, ``scene`` é um recurso de cena compactado, não um nó. Para "
"criar o nó atual, você precisa chamar :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "
"<class_PackedScene_method_instance>`. Ele retorna uma árvore de nós que você "
"pode ter como filho do seu nó atual."

msgid ""
"The advantage of this two-step process is you can keep a packed scene loaded "
"and create new instances on the fly. For example, to quickly instance "
"several enemies or bullets."
msgstr ""
"A vantagem deste processo de duas etapas é que você pode manter uma cena "
"compactada carregada e criar novas instâncias em tempo real. Por exemplo, "
"para rapidamente instanciar vários inimigos ou balas."
