msgid "Evaluating expressions"
msgstr "Avaliando as expressões"

msgid ""
"Godot provides an :ref:`class_Expression` class you can use to evaluate "
"expressions."
msgstr ""

msgid "An expression can be:"
msgstr "Uma expressão pode ser:"

msgid "A mathematical expression such as ``(2 + 4) * 16/4.0``."
msgstr ""

msgid "A built-in method call like ``deg2rad(90)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A method call on an user-provided script like ``update_health()``, if "
"``base_instance`` is set to a value other than ``null`` when calling :ref:"
"`Expression.execute() <class_Expression_method_execute>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Expression class is independent from GDScript. It's available even if "
"you compile Godot with the GDScript module disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic usage"
msgstr "Uso básico"

msgid "To evaluate a mathematical expression, use::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The following operators are available:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Operator"
msgstr "Operador"

msgid "Notes"
msgstr "Notas"

msgid "Addition ``+``"
msgstr "Adição ``+``"

msgid ""
"Can also be used to concatenate strings and arrays: - ``\"hello\" + \" "
"world\"`` = ``hello world`` - ``[1, 2] + [3, 4]`` = ``[1, 2, 3, 4]``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Subtraction (``-``)"
msgstr "Subtração (``-``)"

msgid "Multiplication (``*``)"
msgstr "Multiplicação (``*``)"

msgid "Division (``/``)"
msgstr "Divisão (``/``)"

msgid ""
"Performs and integer division if both operands are integers. If at least one "
"of them is a floating-point number, returns a floating-point value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Modulo (``%``)"
msgstr "Módulo (``%``)"

msgid "Returns the remainder of an integer division."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Spaces around operators are optional. Also, keep in mind the usual `order of "
"operations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations>`__ applies. "
"Use parentheses to override the order of operations if needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All the Variant types supported in Godot can be used: integers, floating-"
"point numbers, strings, arrays, dictionaries, colors, vectors, …"
msgstr ""

msgid "Arrays and dictionaries can be indexed like in GDScript::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Passing variables to an expression"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can pass variables to an expression. These variables will then become "
"available in the expression's \"context\" and will be substituted when used "
"in the expression::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both the variable names and variable values **must** be specified as an "
"array, even if you only define one variable. Also, variable names are **case-"
"sensitive**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting a base instance for the expression"
msgstr "Definindo uma instância base para a expressão"

msgid ""
"By default, an expression has a base instance of ``null``. This means the "
"expression has no base instance associated to it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When calling :ref:`Expression.execute() <class_Expression_method_execute>`, "
"you can set the value of the ``base_instance`` parameter to a specific "
"object instance such as ``self``, another script instance or even a "
"singleton::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Associating a base instance allows doing the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Reference the instance's constants (``const``) in the expression."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reference the instance's member variables (``var``) in the expression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Call methods defined in the instance and use their return values in the "
"expression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting a base instance to a value other than ``null`` allows referencing "
"constants, member variables, and calling all methods defined in the script "
"attached to the instance. Allowing users to enter expressions may allow "
"cheating in your game, or may even introduce security vulnerabilities if you "
"allow arbitrary clients to run expressions on other players' devices."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example script"
msgstr "Exemplo de script"

msgid "The script below demonstrates what the Expression class is capable of::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The output from the script will be::"
msgstr "A saída do script será::"

msgid "Built-in functions"
msgstr "Funções embutidas"

msgid ""
"Most methods available in the :ref:`class_@GDScript` scope are available in "
"the Expression class, even if no base instance is bound to the expression. "
"The same parameters and return types are available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, unlike GDScript, parameters are **always required** even if they're "
"specified as being optional in the class reference. In contrast, this "
"restriction on arguments doesn't apply to user-made functions when you bind "
"a base instance to the expression."
