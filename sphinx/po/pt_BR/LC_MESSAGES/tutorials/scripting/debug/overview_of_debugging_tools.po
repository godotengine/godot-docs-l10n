msgid "Overview of debugging tools"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This guide will give you an overview of the available debugging tools in the "
"engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot comes with a powerful debugger and profilers to track down bugs, "
"inspect your game at runtime, monitor essential metrics, and measure "
"performances. It also offers options to visualize collision boxes and "
"navigation polygons in the running game."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, you have options to debug the game running on a remote device and "
"to reload changes to your scenes or your code while the game is running."
msgstr ""

msgid "Debugger Panel"
msgstr "Painel do Depurador"

msgid ""
"Many of Godot's debugging tools are part of the Debugger panel, which you "
"can find information about in :ref:`doc_debugger_panel`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Debug menu options"
msgstr "Opções do menu de depuração"

msgid ""
"There are a few common debug options you can toggle on or off when running "
"your game in the editor, which can help you in debugging your game."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can find these options in the **Debug** editor menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are the descriptions of the options:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Deploy with Remote Debug"
msgstr "Distribuir com Depuragem Remota"

msgid ""
"When exporting and deploying, the resulting executable will attempt to "
"connect to the IP of your computer for debugging."
msgstr ""

msgid "Small Deploy with Network FS"
msgstr "Pequena DIstribuição com Sistema de Arquivos de Rede"

msgid ""
"This option speeds up testing for games with a large footprint on remote "
"devices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When **Small Deploy with Network FS** is on, instead of exporting the full "
"game, deploying the game builds a minimal executable. The editor then "
"provides files from the project over the network."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, on Android, the game is deployed using the USB cable to speed up "
"deployment."
msgstr ""

msgid "Visible Collision Shapes"
msgstr "Formas de Colisão Visíveis"

msgid ""
"This option makes collision shapes and raycast nodes visible in the running "
"game."
msgstr ""

msgid "Visible Navigation"
msgstr "Navegação Visível"

msgid "Navigation meshes and polygons will be visible on the running game."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sync Scene Changes"
msgstr "Sincronizar Mudanças de Cena"

msgid ""
"With this option, any change you make to a scene in the editor at runtime "
"appears instantly. When used remotely on a device, this is more efficient "
"with the network filesystem."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sync Script Changes"
msgstr "Sincronizar Mudanças de Script"

msgid ""
"Any script that is saved will be reloaded on the running game. When used "
"remotely on a device, this is more efficient with the network filesystem."
msgstr ""

msgid "Script editor debug tools and options"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The script editor has its own set of debug tools for use with breakpoints "
"and two options. The breakpoint tools can also be found in the **Debugger** "
"tab of the debugger."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **Break** button causes a break in the script like a breakpoint would. "
"**Continue** makes the game continue after pausing at a breakpoint. **Step "
"Over** goes to the next line of code, and **Step Into** goes into a function "
"if possible. Otherwise, it does the same thing as **Step Over**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **Keep Debugger Open** option keeps the debugger open after a scene has "
"been closed. And the **Debug with External Editor** option lets you debug "
"your game with an external editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Breakpoints won't break on code if it's :ref:`running in a thread "
"<doc_using_multiple_threads>`. This is a current limitation of the GDScript "
"debugger."
msgstr ""

msgid "Debug project settings"
msgstr "Configurações de depuração do projeto"

msgid ""
"In the project settings, there is a **Debug** category with three "
"subcategories which control different things."
msgstr ""

msgid "Settings"
msgstr "Configurações"

msgid ""
"These are some general settings such as printing the current FPS to the "
"**Output** panel, the maximum amount of functions when profiling and others."
msgstr ""

msgid "GDScript"
msgstr "GDScript"

msgid ""
"These settings allow you to toggle specific GDScript warnings, such as for "
"unused variables. You can also turn off warnings completely."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shapes"
msgstr "Formas"

msgid ""
"Shapes are where you can adjust the color of shapes that only appear for "
"debugging purposes, such as collision and navigation shapes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remote in scene dock"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When running a game in the editor two options appear at the top of the "
"**Scene** dock, **Remote** and **Local**. While using **Remote** you can "
"inspect or change the nodes' parameters in the running project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some editor settings related to debugging can be found inside the **Editor "
"Settings**, under the **Network > Debug** and **Debugger** sections."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "Progresso da Tradução"
