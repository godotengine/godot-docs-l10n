"A large :ref:`Area <class_Area>` node called ``Sleep_Area`` is used to "

"An :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer3D <class_AudioStreamPlayer3D>` node called "

"Finally, the last nodes are the ``Grab_Cast`` node and it's only child node, "
"``Mesh``. The ``Grab_Cast`` node will be used for grabbing :ref:`RigidBody "
"<class_RigidBody>`-based nodes when the VR controller grab mode is set to "
"``RAYCAST``. This will allow the VR controller to grab objects that are just "

"The reason we need to know the offset is because some VR headsets use room "

"Finally, we have four functions. The ``_ready`` function is defined by Godot "

"If ``interface`` is not ``null``, then we set the ``rect_size`` of the "

"accordingly. We also set the ``rect_position`` of the vignette shader to "
"zero so it is in the correct position relative to the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The left and right VR controllers are then retrieved and assigned to "
