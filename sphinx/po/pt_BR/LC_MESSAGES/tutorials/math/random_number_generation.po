msgid "Random number generation"
msgstr "Geração de números aleatórios"

msgid ""
"Many games rely on randomness to implement core game mechanics. This page "
"guides you through common types of randomness and how to implement them in "
"Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After giving you a brief overview of useful functions that generate random "
"numbers, you will learn how to get random elements from arrays, "
"dictionaries, and how to use a noise generator in GDScript."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Computers cannot generate \"true\" random numbers. Instead, they rely on "
"`pseudorandom number generators <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Pseudorandom_number_generator>`__ (PRNGs)."

msgid "Global scope versus RandomNumberGenerator class"
msgstr "Escopo global versus classe RandomNumberGenerator"

msgid ""
"Godot exposes two ways to generate random numbers: via *global scope* "
"methods or using the :ref:`class_RandomNumberGenerator` class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Global scope methods are easier to set up, but they don't offer as much "
"control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"RandomNumberGenerator requires more code to use, but exposes many methods "
"not found in global scope such as :ref:`randi_range() "
"<class_RandomNumberGenerator_method_randi_range>` and :ref:`randfn() "
"<class_RandomNumberGenerator_method_randfn>`. On top of that, it allows "
"creating multiple instances each with their own seed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial uses global scope methods, except when the method only exists "
"in the RandomNumberGenerator class."
msgstr ""

msgid "The randomize() method"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In global scope, you can find a :ref:`randomize() "
"<class_@GDScript_method_randomize>` method. **This method should be called "
"only once when your project starts to initialize the random seed.** Calling "
"it multiple times is unnecessary and may impact performance negatively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Putting it in your main scene script's ``_ready()`` method is a good choice:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also set a fixed random seed instead using :ref:`seed() "
"<class_@GDScript_method_seed>`. Doing so will give you *deterministic* "
"results across runs:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the RandomNumberGenerator class, you should call ``randomize()`` "
"on the instance since it has its own seed:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Getting a random number"
msgstr "Obtendo um número aleatório"

msgid ""
"Let's look at some of the most commonly used functions and methods to "
"generate random numbers in Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function :ref:`randi() <class_@GDScript_method_randi>` returns a random "
"number between 0 and 2^32-1. Since the maximum value is huge, you most "
"likely want to use the modulo operator (``%``) to bound the result between 0 "
"and the denominator:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`randf() <class_@GDScript_method_randf>` returns a random floating-"
"point number between 0 and 1. This is useful to implement a :ref:"
"`doc_random_number_generation_weighted_random_probability` system, among "
"other things."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`randfn() <class_RandomNumberGenerator_method_randfn>` returns a random "
"floating-point number following a `normal distribution <https://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Normal_distribution>`__. This means the returned value is more "
"likely to be around the mean (0.0 by default), varying by the deviation (1.0 "
"by default):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`rand_range() <class_@GDScript_method_rand_range>` takes two arguments "
"``from`` and ``to``, and returns a random floating-point number between "
"``from`` and ``to``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`RandomNumberGenerator.randi_range() "
"<class_RandomNumberGenerator_method_randi_range>` takes two arguments "
"``from`` and ``to``, and returns a random integer between ``from`` and "
"``to``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Get a random array element"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can use random integer generation to get a random element from an array:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To prevent the same fruit from being picked more than once in a row, we can "
"add more logic to this method:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This approach can be useful to make random number generation feel less "
"repetitive. Still, it doesn't prevent results from \"ping-ponging\" between "
"a limited set of values. To prevent this, use the :ref:`shuffle bag "
"<doc_random_number_generation_shuffle_bags>` pattern instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Get a random dictionary value"
msgstr "Obtenha um valor aleatório de um dicionário"

msgid "We can apply similar logic from arrays to dictionaries as well:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Weighted random probability"
msgstr "Probabilidade aleatória ponderada"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`randf() <class_@GDScript_method_randf>` method returns a floating-"
"point number between 0.0 and 1.0. We can use this to create a \"weighted\" "
"probability where different outcomes have different likelihoods:"
msgstr ""

msgid "\"Better\" randomness using shuffle bags"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Taking the same example as above, we would like to pick fruits at random. "
"However, relying on random number generation every time a fruit is selected "
"can lead to a less *uniform* distribution. If the player is lucky (or "
"unlucky), they could get the same fruit three or more times in a row."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can accomplish this using the *shuffle bag* pattern. It works by "
"removing an element from the array after choosing it. After multiple "
"selections, the array ends up empty. When that happens, you reinitialize it "
"to its default value::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When running the above code, there is a chance to get the same fruit twice "
"in a row. Once we picked a fruit, it will no longer be a possible return "
"value unless the array is now empty. When the array is empty, we reset it "
"back to its default value, making it possible to have the same fruit again, "
"but only once."
msgstr ""

msgid "Random noise"
msgstr "Ruído aleatório"

msgid ""
"The random number generation shown above can show its limits when you need a "
"value that *slowly* changes depending on the input. The input can be a "
"position, time, or anything else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To achieve this, you can use random *noise* functions. Noise functions are "
"especially popular in procedural generation to generate realistic-looking "
"terrain. Godot provides :ref:`class_opensimplexnoise` for this, which "
"supports 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D noise. Here's an example with 1D noise:"
