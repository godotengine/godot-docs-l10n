msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Introdução"

msgid ""
"This tutorial is a short and practical introduction to linear algebra as it "
"applies to game development. Linear algebra is the study of vectors and "
"their uses. Vectors have many applications in both 2D and 3D development and "
"Godot uses them extensively. Developing a good understanding of vector math "
"is essential to becoming a strong game developer."
msgstr ""
"Este tutorial é uma introdução curta e prática à Álgebra Linear e como ela "
"se aplica ao desenvolvimento de jogos. A Álgebra Linear é o estudo de "
"vetores e seus usos. Vetores possuem diversas aplicações em desenvolvimento "
"2D e 3D, e Godot as usa extensivamente. Desenvolver um bom entendimento de "
"matemática vetorial é essencial para se tornar um bom desenvolvedor de jogos."

msgid ""
"This tutorial is **not** a formal textbook on linear algebra. We will only "
"be looking at how it is applied to game development. For a broader look at "
"the mathematics, see https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra"
msgstr ""
"Este tutorial **não** é um livro formal sobre álgebra linear. Veremos apenas "
"como os vetores são aplicados no desenvolvimento de jogos. Para uma visão "
"mais ampla sobre matemática, veja https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-"

msgid "Coordinate systems (2D)"
msgstr "Sistema de Coordenadas (2D)"

msgid ""
"In 2D space, coordinates are defined using a horizontal axis (``x``) and a "
"vertical axis (``y``). A particular position in 2D space is written as a "
"pair of values such as ``(4, 3)``."
msgstr ""
"Em espaço 2D, coordenadas são definidas usando um eixo horizontal (``x``) e "
"um eixo vertical (``y``). Uma posição particular em espaço 2D é escrito como "
"um par de valores como ``(4, 3)``."

msgid ""
"If you're new to computer graphics, it might seem odd that the positive "
"``y`` axis points **downwards** instead of upwards, as you probably learned "
"in math class. However, this is common in most computer graphics "
"applications."
msgstr ""
"Se você é novo em gráficos de computador, pode parecer estranho que o eixo "
"``y`` positivo aponte **para baixo** ao invés de para cima, como você "
"provavelmente aprendeu em aulas de matemática. Contudo, isso é comum em "
"muitas aplicações gráficas de computador."

msgid ""
"Any position in the 2D plane can be identified by a pair of numbers in this "
"way. However, we can also think of the position ``(4, 3)`` as an **offset** "
"from the ``(0, 0)`` point, or **origin**. Draw an arrow pointing from the "
"origin to the point:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a **vector**. A vector represents a lot of useful information. As "
"well as telling us that the point is at ``(4, 3)``, we can also think of it "
"as an angle ``θ`` (theta) and a length (or magnitude) ``m``. In this case, "
"the arrow is a **position vector** - it denotes a position in space, "
"relative to the origin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A very important point to consider about vectors is that they only represent "
"**relative** direction and magnitude. There is no concept of a vector's "
"position. The following two vectors are identical:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both vectors represent a point 4 units to the right and 3 units below some "
"starting point. It does not matter where on the plane you draw the vector, "
"it always represents a relative direction and magnitude."
msgstr ""

msgid "Vector operations"
msgstr "Operações vetoriais"

msgid ""
"You can use either method (x and y coordinates or angle and magnitude) to "
"refer to a vector, but for convenience, programmers typically use the "
"coordinate notation. For example, in Godot, the origin is the top-left "
"corner of the screen, so to place a 2D node named ``Node2D`` 400 pixels to "
"the right and 300 pixels down, use the following code:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot supports both :ref:`Vector2 <class_Vector2>` and :ref:`Vector3 "
"<class_Vector3>` for 2D and 3D usage, respectively. The same mathematical "
"rules discussed in this article apply to both types, and wherever we link to "
"``Vector2`` methods in the class reference, you can also check out their "
"``Vector3`` counterparts."
msgstr ""

msgid "Member access"
msgstr "Acesso de membros"

msgid ""
"The individual components of the vector can be accessed directly by name."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding vectors"
msgstr "Adicionando vetores"

msgid ""
"When adding or subtracting two vectors, the corresponding components are "
"added:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can also see this visually by adding the second vector at the end of the "
"first:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that adding ``a + b`` gives the same result as ``b + a``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scalar multiplication"
msgstr "Multiplicação escalar"

msgid ""
"Vectors represent both direction and magnitude. A value representing only "
"magnitude is called a **scalar**. Scalars use the :ref:`class_float` type in "
"Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid "A vector can be multiplied by a **scalar**:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiplying a vector by a positive scalar does not change its direction, "
"only its magnitude. Multiplying with a negative scalar results in a vector "
"in the opposite direction. This is how you **scale** a vector."
msgstr ""

msgid "Practical applications"
msgstr "Aplicações práticas"

msgid "Let's look at two common uses for vector addition and subtraction."
msgstr ""

msgid "Movement"
msgstr "Movimento"

msgid ""
"A vector can represent **any** quantity with a magnitude and direction. "
"Typical examples are: position, velocity, acceleration, and force. In this "
"image, the spaceship at step 1 has a position vector of ``(1, 3)`` and a "
"velocity vector of ``(2, 1)``. The velocity vector represents how far the "
"ship moves each step. We can find the position for step 2 by adding the "
"velocity to the current position."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Velocity measures the **change** in position per unit of time. The new "
"position is found by adding the velocity multiplied by the elapsed time "
"(here assumed to be one unit, e.g. 1 s) to the previous position."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In a typical 2D game scenario, you would have a velocity in pixels per "
"second, and multiply it by the ``delta`` parameter (time elapsed since the "
"previous frame) from the :ref:`_process() "
"<class_Node_private_method__process>` or :ref:`_physics_process() "
"<class_Node_private_method__physics_process>` callbacks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pointing toward a target"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this scenario, you have a tank that wishes to point its turret at a "
"robot. Subtracting the tank's position from the robot's position gives the "
"vector pointing from the tank to the robot."
msgstr ""

msgid "To find a vector pointing from ``A`` to ``B``, use ``B - A``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unit vectors"
msgstr "Vetores unitários"

msgid ""
"A vector with **magnitude** of ``1`` is called a **unit vector**. They are "
"also sometimes referred to as **direction vectors** or **normals**. Unit "
"vectors are helpful when you need to keep track of a direction."
msgstr ""

msgid "Normalization"
msgstr "Normalização"

msgid ""
"**Normalizing** a vector means reducing its length to ``1`` while preserving "
"its direction. This is done by dividing each of its components by its "
"magnitude. Because this is such a common operation, Godot provides a "
"dedicated :ref:`normalized() <class_Vector2_method_normalized>` method for "
"this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because normalization involves dividing by the vector's length, you cannot "
"normalize a vector of length ``0``. Attempting to do so would normally "
"result in an error. In GDScript though, trying to call the ``normalized()`` "
"method on a vector of length 0 leaves the value untouched and avoids the "
"error for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reflection"
msgstr "Reflexão"

msgid ""
"A common use of unit vectors is to indicate **normals**. Normal vectors are "
"unit vectors aligned perpendicularly to a surface, defining its direction. "
"They are commonly used for lighting, collisions, and other operations "
"involving surfaces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, imagine we have a moving ball that we want to bounce off a wall "
"or other object:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The surface normal has a value of ``(0, -1)`` because this is a horizontal "
"surface. When the ball collides, we take its remaining motion (the amount "
"left over when it hits the surface) and reflect it using the normal. In "
"Godot, there is a :ref:`bounce() <class_Vector2_method_bounce>` method to "
"handle this. Here is a code example of the above diagram using a :ref:"
"`CharacterBody2D <class_CharacterBody2D>`:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Dot product"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **dot product** is one of the most important concepts in vector math, "
"but is often misunderstood. Dot product is an operation on two vectors that "
"returns a **scalar**. Unlike a vector, which contains both magnitude and "
"direction, a scalar value has only magnitude."
msgstr ""

msgid "The formula for dot product takes two common forms:"
msgstr ""

msgid "and"
msgstr "e"

msgid ""
"The mathematical notation *||A||* represents the magnitude of vector ``A``, "
"and *A*\\ :sub:`x` means the ``x`` component of vector ``A``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, in most cases it is easiest to use the built-in :ref:`dot() "
"<class_Vector2_method_dot>` method. Note that the order of the two vectors "
"does not matter:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The dot product is most useful when used with unit vectors, making the first "
"formula reduce to just ``cos(θ)``. This means we can use the dot product to "
"tell us something about the angle between two vectors:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using unit vectors, the result will always be between ``-1`` (180°) and "
"``1`` (0°)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Facing"
msgstr "Orientação (Voltado para)"

msgid ""
"We can use this fact to detect whether an object is facing toward another "
"object. In the diagram below, the player ``P`` is trying to avoid the "
"zombies ``A`` and ``B``. Assuming a zombie's field of view is **180°**, can "
"they see the player?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The green arrows ``fA`` and ``fB`` are **unit vectors** representing the "
"zombie's facing direction and the blue semicircle represents its field of "
"view. For zombie ``A``, we find the direction vector ``AP`` pointing to the "
"player using ``P - A`` and normalize it, however, Godot has a helper method "
"to do this called :ref:`direction_to() <class_Vector2_method_direction_to>`. "
"If the angle between this vector and the facing vector is less than 90°, "
"then the zombie can see the player."
msgstr ""

msgid "In code it would look like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cross product"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like the dot product, the **cross product** is an operation on two vectors. "
"However, the result of the cross product is a vector with a direction that "
"is perpendicular to both. Its magnitude depends on their relative angle. If "
"two vectors are parallel, the result of their cross product will be a null "
"vector."
msgstr ""

msgid "The cross product is calculated like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With Godot, you can use the built-in :ref:`Vector3.cross() "
"<class_Vector3_method_cross>` method:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The cross product is not mathematically defined in 2D. The :ref:`Vector2."
"cross() <class_Vector2_method_cross>` method is a commonly used analog of "
"the 3D cross product for 2D vectors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the cross product, order matters. ``a.cross(b)`` does not give the same "
"result as ``b.cross(a)``. The resulting vectors point in **opposite** "
"directions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Calculating normals"
msgstr "Calculando normais"

msgid ""
"One common use of cross products is to find the surface normal of a plane or "
"surface in 3D space. If we have the triangle ``ABC`` we can use vector "
"subtraction to find two edges ``AB`` and ``AC``. Using the cross product, "
"``AB × AC`` produces a vector perpendicular to both: the surface normal."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is a function to calculate a triangle's normal:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pointing to a target"
msgstr "Apontando para um destino"

msgid ""
"In the dot product section above, we saw how it could be used to find the "
"angle between two vectors. However, in 3D, this is not enough information. "
"We also need to know what axis to rotate around. We can find that by "
"calculating the cross product of the current facing direction and the target "
"direction. The resulting perpendicular vector is the axis of rotation."
msgstr ""

msgstr "Mais informações"
