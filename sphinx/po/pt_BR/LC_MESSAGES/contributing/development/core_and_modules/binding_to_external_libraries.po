"The Summator example in :ref:`doc_custom_modules_in_cpp` is great for small, "
"custom modules, but what if you want to use a larger, external library? "
"Let's look at an example using `Festival <https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/"
"festival/>`_, a speech synthesis (text-to-speech) library written in C++."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To bind to an external library, set up a module directory similar to the "
"Summator example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Next, you will create a header file with a TTS class:"
msgstr ""

msgid "And then you'll add the cpp file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Just as before, the new class needs to be registered somehow, so two more "
"files need to be created:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These files must be in the top-level folder of your module (next to your "
"``SCsub`` and ``config.py`` files) for the module to be registered properly."
msgstr ""

msgid "These files should contain the following:"
msgstr "Esses arquivos devem conter o seguinte:"

msgid ""
"Next, you need to create a ``SCsub`` file so the build system compiles this "
"module:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You'll need to install the external library on your machine to get the .a "
"library files. See the library's official documentation for specific "
"instructions on how to do this for your operation system. We've included the "
"installation commands for Linux below, for reference."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The voices that Festival uses (and any other potential external/3rd-party "
"resource) all have varying licenses and terms of use; some (if not most) of "
"them may be be problematic with Godot, even if the Festival Library itself "
"is MIT License compatible. Please be sure to check the licenses and terms of "
"use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The external library will also need to be installed inside your module to "
"make the source files accessible to the compiler, while also keeping the "
"module code self-contained. The festival and speech_tools libraries can be "
"installed from the modules/tts/ directory via git using the following "
"commands:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't want the external repository source files committed to your "
"repository, you can link to them instead by adding them as submodules (from "
"within the modules/tts/ directory), as seen below:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please note that Git submodules are not used in the Godot repository. If you "
"are developing a module to be merged into the main Godot repository, you "
"should not use submodules. If your module doesn't get merged in, you can "
"always try to implement the external library as a GDExtension."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add include directories for the compiler to look at you can append it to "
"the environment's paths:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to add custom compiler flags when building your module, you need "
"to clone `env` first, so it won't add those flags to whole Godot build "
"(which can cause errors). Example `SCsub` with custom flags:"
msgstr ""
"Se você quer adicionar flags customizadas do compilador quando gerando seu "
"módulo, você precisa clonar `env` primeiro, então ele não adicionará essas "
"flags ao Godot inteiro (que pode causar erros). Exemplo `SCub` com flags "
"customizadas:"

msgid "The final module should look like this:"
msgstr "O módulo final deve se parecer com isto:"

msgid "Using the module"
msgstr "Usando o módulo"

msgid "You can now use your newly created module from any script:"
