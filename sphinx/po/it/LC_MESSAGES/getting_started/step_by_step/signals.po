"In this lesson, we will look at signals. They are messages that nodes emit "
"when something specific happens to them, like a button being pressed. Other "
"nodes can connect to that signal and call a function when the event occurs."

"Signals are a delegation mechanism built into Godot that allows one game "
"object to react to a change in another without them referencing one another. "
"Using signals limits `coupling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Coupling_(computer_programming)>`_ and keeps your code flexible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, you might have a life bar on the screen that represents the "
"player's health. When the player takes damage or uses a healing potion, you "
"want the bar to reflect the change. To do so, in Godot, you would use "
"signals."

"we created in the :ref:`doc_scripting_first_script` lesson."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a new scene by going to the menu Scene -> New Scene."

"In the Scene dock, click the 2D Scene button. This will add a :ref:`Node2D "
"<class_Node2D>` as our root."

msgid ""
"In the FileSystem dock, click and drag the ``sprite_2d.tscn`` file you saved "
"previously onto the Node2D to instantiate it."

msgid ""
"Here, we want to connect the Button's \"pressed\" signal to our Sprite2D, "
"and we want to call a new function that will toggle its motion on and off. "
"We need to have a script attached to the Sprite2D node, which we do from the "
"previous lesson."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can connect signals in the Node dock. Select the Button node and, on the "
"right side of the editor, click on the tab named \"Node\" next to the "
"Inspector."
msgstr ""

msgid "The dock displays a list of signals available on the selected node."
msgstr ""

msgid "Double-click the \"pressed\" signal to open the node connection window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There, you can connect the signal to the Sprite2D node. The node needs a "
"receiver method, a function that Godot will call when the Button emits the "
"signal. The editor generates one for you. By convention, we name these "
"callback methods \"_on_node_name_signal_name\". Here, it'll be "
"\"_on_button_pressed\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When connecting signals via the editor's Node dock, you can use two modes. "
"The simple one only allows you to connect to nodes that have a script "
"attached to them and creates a new callback function on them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The advanced view lets you connect to any node and any built-in function, "
"add arguments to the callback, and set options. You can toggle the mode in "
"the window's bottom-right by clicking the Advanced button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click the Connect button to complete the signal connection and jump to the "
"Script workspace. You should see the new method with a connection icon in "
"the left margin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you click the icon, a window pops up and displays information about the "
"connection. This feature is only available when connecting nodes in the "
"editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's replace the line with the ``pass`` keyword with code that'll toggle "
"the node's motion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our Sprite2D moves thanks to code in the ``_process()`` function. Godot "
"provides a method to toggle processing on and off: :ref:`Node.set_process() "
"<class_Node_method_set_process>`. Another method of the Node class, "
"``is_processing()``, returns ``true`` if idle processing is active. We can "
"use the ``not`` keyword to invert the value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function will toggle processing and, in turn, the icon's motion on and "
"off upon pressing the button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before trying the game, we need to simplify our ``_process()`` function to "
"move the node automatically and not wait for user input. Replace it with the "
"following code, which we saw two lessons ago:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Your complete ``sprite_2d.gd`` code should look like the following."

msgid "Connecting a signal via code"
msgstr "Collegamento di segnali nel codice"

msgid ""
"You can connect signals via code instead of using the editor. This is "
"necessary when you create nodes or instantiate scenes inside of a script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's use a different node here. Godot has a :ref:`Timer <class_Timer>` node "
"that's useful to implement skill cooldown times, weapon reloading, and more."

msgid ""
"In the Scene dock, right-click on the Sprite2D node and add a new child "
"node. Search for Timer and add the corresponding node. Your scene should now "

msgid "Get a reference to the Timer from the Sprite2D."
msgstr "Ottieni un riferimento al Timer da Sprite2D."

msgid "Call the ``connect()`` method on the Timer's \"timeout\" signal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To connect to a signal via code, you need to call the ``connect()`` method "
"of the signal you want to listen to. In this case, we want to listen to the "
"Timer's \"timeout\" signal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We want to connect the signal when the scene is instantiated, and we can do "
"that using the :ref:`Node._ready() <class_Node_private_method__ready>` built-"
"in function, which is called automatically by the engine when a node is "
"fully instantiated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get a reference to a node relative to the current one, we use the method :"
"ref:`Node.get_node() <class_Node_method_get_node>`. We can store the "
"reference in a variable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function ``get_node()`` looks at the Sprite2D's children and gets nodes "
"by their name. For example, if you renamed the Timer node to "
"\"BlinkingTimer\" in the editor, you would have to change the call to "
"``get_node(\"BlinkingTimer\")``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can now connect the Timer to the Sprite2D in the ``_ready()`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The line reads like so: we connect the Timer's \"timeout\" signal to the "
"node to which the script is attached. When the Timer emits ``timeout``, we "
"want to call the function ``_on_timer_timeout()``, that we need to define. "
"Let's add it at the bottom of our script and use it to toggle our sprite's "
"visibility."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By convention, we name these callback methods in GDScript as "
"\"_on_node_name_signal_name\" and in C# as \"OnNodeNameSignalName\". Here, "
"it'll be \"_on_timer_timeout\" for GDScript and OnTimerTimeout() for C#."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``visible`` property is a boolean that controls the visibility of our "
"node. The line ``visible = not visible`` toggles the value. If ``visible`` "

msgid "Custom signals"
msgstr "Segnali personalizzati"

msgid ""
"This section is a reference on how to define and use your own signals, and "
"does not build upon the project created in previous lessons."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can define custom signals in a script. Say, for example, that you want "
"to show a game over screen when the player's health reaches zero. To do so, "
"you could define a signal named \"died\" or \"health_depleted\" when their "
"health reaches 0."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As signals represent events that just occurred, we generally use an action "
"verb in the past tense in their names."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your signals work the same way as built-in ones: they appear in the Node tab "
"and you can connect to them like any other."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "To emit a signal in your scripts, call ``emit()`` on the signal."
msgstr "Per emettere un segnale nei tuoi script, chiama ``emit_signal()``."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"A signal can optionally declare one or more arguments. Specify the argument "
"names between parentheses:"
msgstr ""
"Un segnale può anche opzionalmente dichiarare uno o più argomenti. Specifica "
"i nomi degli argomenti tra parentesi:"

msgid ""
"The signal arguments show up in the editor's node dock, and Godot can use "
"them to generate callback functions for you. However, you can still emit any "
"number of arguments when you emit signals. So it's up to you to emit the "
"correct values."
msgstr ""
"I segnali sono argomenti che vengono visualizzati nel riquadro del nodo "
"dell'editor e Godot può utilizzarli per generare funzioni di callback. "
"Tuttavia, è ancora possibile emettere un numero qualsiasi di argomenti "
"quando si emettono segnali, quindi spetta a te fornire i valori corretti."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"To emit values along with the signal, add them as extra arguments to the "
"``emit()`` function:"
msgstr ""
"Per passare dei valori, aggiungeteli come secondo argomento alla funzione "
"``emit_signal``:"

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "Sommario"

msgid ""
"Any node in Godot emits signals when something specific happens to them, "
"like a button being pressed. Other nodes can connect to individual signals "
"and react to selected events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Signals have many uses. With them, you can react to a node entering or "
"exiting the game world, to a collision, to a character entering or leaving "
"an area, to an element of the interface changing size, and much more."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"For example, an :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` representing a coin emits a "
"``body_entered`` signal whenever the player's physics body enters its "
"collision shape, allowing you to know when the player collected it."
msgstr ""
"Tanti dei Nodi di Godot forniscono segnali che puoi usare per rilevare "
"eventi. Per esempio, un :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` che rappresenta una "
"moneta emette un segnale ``body_entered`` quando il corpo del giocatore "
"entra nella sua collision shape, facendoti capire quando il giocatore l'ha "
"raccolta."

"In the next section, :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game`, you'll create a complete "
"2D game and put everything you learned so far into practice."
msgstr ""
"Nella prossima sezione, :ref:`doc_your_first_game`, creerai un gioco "
"completo includendo l'uso di segnali per connettere differenti componenti di "
"gioco."
