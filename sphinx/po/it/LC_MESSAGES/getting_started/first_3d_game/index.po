"The game we'll code here is similar to :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game`, with a "
"twist: you can now jump and your goal is to squash the creeps. This way, you "
"will both **recognize patterns** you learned in the previous tutorial and "
"**build upon them** with new code and features."

"This tutorial is for beginners who followed the complete getting started "
"series. We'll start slow with detailed instructions and shorten them as we "
"do similar steps. If you're an experienced programmer, you can browse the "
"complete demo's source code here: `Squash the Creep source code <https://"

"You can follow this series without having done the 2D one. However, if "
"you're new to game development, we recommend you to start with 2D. 3D game "
"code is always more complex and the 2D series will give you foundations to "
"follow along more comfortably."

"We will first work on a basic prototype for the player's movement. We will "
"then add the monsters that we'll spawn randomly around the screen. After "
"that, we'll implement the jump and squashing mechanic before refining the "
"game with some nice animation. We'll wrap up with the score and the retry "
"screen."
