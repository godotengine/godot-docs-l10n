msgid "Controlling physics interactions"
msgstr "Controllo dell'animazione"

msgid ""
"Physics bodies have access to two complementary properties: layers and "
"masks. Layers define on which physics layer(s) an object is."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Masks control the layers that a body will listen to and detect. This affects "
"collision detection. When you want two bodies to interact, you need at least "
"one to have a mask corresponding to the other."
msgstr ""

msgid "If that's confusing, don't worry, we'll see three examples in a second."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The important point is that you can use layers and masks to filter physics "
"interactions, control performance, and remove the need for extra conditions "
"in your code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, all physics bodies and areas are set to both layer and mask "
"``0``. This means they all collide with each other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Physics layers are represented by numbers, but we can give them names to "
"keep track of what's what."

"In the left menu, navigate down to *Layer Names -> 3D Physics*. You can see "

"*world*, respectively."

"As I mentioned above, the *Mask* property allows a node to listen to "
"interaction with other physics objects, but we don't need it to have "
"collisions. The *Ground* doesn't need to listen to anything; it's just there "
"to prevent creatures from falling."

"These settings mean the monsters will move through one another. If you want "
"the monsters to collide with and slide against each other, turn on the "
"\"enemies\" mask."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The mobs don't need to mask the \"world\" layer because they only move on "
"the XZ plane. We don't apply any gravity to them by design."
msgstr ""

msgid "Jumping"
msgstr "Saltare"

msgid ""
"The jumping mechanic itself requires only two lines of code. Open the "
"*Player* script. We need a value to control the jump's strength and update "
"``_physics_process()`` to code the jump."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the line that defines ``fall_acceleration``, at the top of the script, "
"add the ``jump_impulse``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Inside ``_physics_process()``, add the following code before the line where "
"we called ``move_and_slide()``."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's all you need to jump!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``is_on_floor()`` method is a tool from the ``KinematicBody`` class. It "
"returns ``true`` if the body collided with the floor in this frame. That's "
"why we apply gravity to the *Player*: so we collide with the floor instead "
"of floating over it like the monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the character is on the floor and the player presses \"jump\", we "
"instantly give them a lot of vertical speed. In games, you really want "
"controls to be responsive and giving instant speed boosts like these, while "
"unrealistic, feel great."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice that the Y axis is positive upwards. That's unlike 2D, where the Y "
"axis is positive downward."
msgstr ""

msgid "Squashing monsters"
msgstr "Schiacciare i mostri"

msgid ""
"Let's add the squash mechanic next. We're going to make the character bounce "
"over monsters and kill them at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We need to detect collisions with a monster and to differentiate them from "
"collisions with the floor. To do so, we can use Godot's :ref:`group "
"<doc_groups>` tagging feature."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open the scene ``Mob.tscn`` again and select the *Mob* node. Go to the "
"*Node* dock on the right to see a list of signals. The *Node* dock has two "
"tabs: *Signals*, which you've already used, and *Groups*, which allows you "
"to assign tags to nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click on it to reveal a field where you can write a tag name. Enter \"mob\" "
"in the field and click the *Add* button."

"An icon appears in the *Scene* dock to indicate the node is part of at least "
"one group."

msgid "image8"
msgstr "image8"

msgid ""
"We can now use the group from the code to distinguish collisions with "
"monsters from collisions with the floor."
msgstr ""

msgid "Coding the squash mechanic"
msgstr ""

msgid "Head back to the *Player* script to code the squash and bounce."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the top of the script, we need another property, ``bounce_impulse``. When "
"squashing an enemy, we don't necessarily want the character to go as high up "
"as when jumping."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, at the bottom of ``_physics_process()``, add the following loop. With "
"``move_and_slide()``, Godot makes the body move sometimes multiple times in "
"a row to smooth out the character's motion. So we have to loop over all "
"collisions that may have happened."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In every iteration of the loop, we check if we landed on a mob. If so, we "
"kill it and bounce."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With this code, if no collisions occurred on a given frame, the loop won't "
"run."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's a lot of new functions. Here's some more information about them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The functions ``get_slide_count()`` and ``get_slide_collision()`` both come "
"from the :ref:`KinematicBody<class_KinematicBody>` class and are related to "
"``move_and_slide()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``get_slide_collision()`` returns a :ref:"
"`KinematicCollision<class_KinematicCollision>` object that holds information "
"about where and how the collision occurred. For example, we use its "
"``collider`` property to check if we collided with a \"mob\" by calling "
"``is_in_group()`` on it: ``collision.collider.is_in_group(\"mob\")``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The method ``is_in_group()`` is available on every :ref:`Node<class_Node>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check that we are landing on the monster, we use the vector dot product: "
"``Vector3.UP.dot(collision.normal) > 0.1``. The collision normal is a 3D "
"vector that is perpendicular to the plane where the collision occurred. The "
"dot product allows us to compare it to the up direction."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With dot products, when the result is greater than ``0``, the two vectors "
"are at an angle of fewer than 90 degrees. A value higher than ``0.1`` tells "
"us that we are roughly above the monster."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We are calling one undefined function, ``mob.squash()``. We have to add it "
"to the Mob class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open the script ``Mob.gd`` by double-clicking on it in the *FileSystem* "
"dock. At the top of the script, we want to define a new signal named "
"``squashed``. And at the bottom, you can add the squash function, where we "
"emit the signal and destroy the mob."
msgstr ""

msgid "We will use the signal to add points to the score in the next lesson."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With that, you should be able to kill monsters by jumping on them. You can "
"press :kbd:`F5` to try the game and set ``Main.tscn`` as your project's main "
"scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "However, the player won't die yet. We'll work on that in the next part."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "Stato della traduzione"
