"Character bodies are complementary to the area and rigid bodies used in the "
"2D game tutorial. Like rigid bodies, they can move and collide with the "
"environment, but instead of being controlled by the physics engine, **you** "
"dictate their movement. You will see how we use the node's unique features "
"when we code the jump and squash mechanics."

"The ``.glb`` files contain 3D scene data based on the open source GLTF 2.0 "
"specification. They're a modern and powerful alternative to a proprietary "

"designed the model in `Blender 3D <https://www.blender.org/>`__ and exported "
"it to GLTF."

"As with all kinds of physics nodes, we need a collision shape for our "

"To move the character, we will listen to the player's input, like pressing "
