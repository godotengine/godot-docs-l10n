"Godot's scripting API is duck-typed. This means that if a script executes an "
"operation, Godot doesn't validate that it supports the operation by "
"**type**. It instead checks that the object **implements** the individual "
"method."

"For example, the :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` class has a "
"``visible`` property. All properties exposed to the scripting API are in "
"fact a setter and getter pair bound to a name. If one tried to access :ref:"
"`CanvasItem.visible <class_CanvasItem_property_visible>`, then Godot would "
"do the following checks, in order:"

"If the object has a script attached, it will attempt to set the property "
"through the script. This leaves open the opportunity for scripts to override "

"property."

"If the script does not have the property, it performs a HashMap lookup in "

"If not, it checks for a ``_set``/``_get`` implementation (depending on type "
