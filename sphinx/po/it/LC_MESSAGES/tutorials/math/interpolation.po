"Interpolation is a very basic operation in graphics programming. It's good "
"to become familiar with it in order to expand your horizons as a graphics "
"developer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The basic idea is that you want to transition from A to B. A value ``t``, "
"represents the states in-between."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As an example if ``t`` is 0, then the state is A. If ``t`` is 1, then the "
"state is B. Anything in-between is an *interpolation*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Between two real (floating-point) numbers, a simple interpolation is usually "
"described as:"
msgstr ""

msgid "And often simplified to:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The name of this type of interpolation, which transforms a value into "
"another at *constant speed* is *\"linear\"*. So, when you hear about *Linear "
"Interpolation*, you know they are referring to this simple formula."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are other types of interpolations, which will not be covered here. A "
"recommended read afterwards is the :ref:`Bezier <doc_beziers_and_curves>` "
"page."

msgid "Vector interpolation"
msgstr "Interpolazione vettoriale"

msgid ""
"Vector types (:ref:`Vector2 <class_Vector2>` and :ref:`Vector3 "
"<class_Vector3>`) can also be interpolated, they come with handy functions "
"to do it :ref:`Vector2.linear_interpolate() "
"<class_Vector2_method_linear_interpolate>` and :ref:`Vector3."
"linear_interpolate() <class_Vector3_method_linear_interpolate>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For cubic interpolation, there are also :ref:`Vector2.cubic_interpolate() "
"<class_Vector2_method_cubic_interpolate>` and :ref:`Vector3."
"cubic_interpolate() <class_Vector3_method_cubic_interpolate>`, which do a :"
"ref:`Bezier <doc_beziers_and_curves>` style interpolation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is simple pseudo-code for going from point A to B using interpolation:"
msgstr ""

msgid "It will produce the following motion:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Transform interpolation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is also possible to interpolate whole transforms (make sure they have "
"either uniform scale or, at least, the same non-uniform scale). For this, "
"the function :ref:`Transform.interpolate_with() "
"<class_Transform_method_interpolate_with>` can be used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is an example of transforming a monkey from Position1 to Position2:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the following pseudocode:"
msgstr ""

msgid "And again, it will produce the following motion:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Smoothing motion"
msgstr "'Smoothing motion'"

msgid ""
"Interpolation can be used to smooth movement, rotation, etc. Here is an "
"example of a circle following the mouse using smoothed motion:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is how it looks:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This useful for smoothing camera movement, allies following you (ensuring "
"they stay within a certain range), and many other common game patterns."
