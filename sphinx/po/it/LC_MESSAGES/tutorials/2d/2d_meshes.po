"In 3D, meshes are used to display the world. In 2D, they are rare as images "
"are used more often. Godot's 2D engine is a pure two-dimensional engine, so "
"it can't really display 3D meshes directly (although it can be done via "
"``Viewport`` and ``ViewportTexture``)."

"If you are interested in displaying 3D meshes on a 2D viewport, see the :ref:"
"`doc_viewport_as_texture` tutorial."

msgid ""
"2D meshes are meshes that contain two-dimensional geometry (Z can be omitted "
"or ignored) instead of 3D. You can experiment creating them yourself using "
"``SurfaceTool`` from code and displaying them in a ``MeshInstance2D`` node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Currently, the only way to generate a 2D mesh within the editor is by either "
"importing an OBJ file as a mesh, or converting it from a Sprite2D."

msgid "Optimizing pixels drawn"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This workflow is useful for optimizing 2D drawing in some situations. When "
"drawing large images with transparency, Godot will draw the whole quad to "
"the screen. The large transparent areas will still be drawn."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can affect performance, especially on mobile devices, when drawing very "
"large images (generally screen sized), or layering multiple images on top of "
"each other with large transparent areas (for example, when using "
"``ParallaxBackground``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Converting to a mesh will ensure that only the opaque parts will be drawn "
"and the rest will be ignored."

msgid ""
"You can take advantage of this optimization by converting a ``Sprite2D`` to "
"a ``MeshInstance2D``. Start with an image that contains large amounts of "
"transparency on the edges, like this tree:"

"The default values are good enough for many cases, but you can change growth "
