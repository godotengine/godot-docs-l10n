msgid ""
"A simple (but flexible enough for most uses) particle system is provided. "
"Particle systems are used to simulate complex physical effects, such as "
"sparks, fire, magic particles, smoke, mist, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The idea is that a \"particle\" is emitted at a fixed interval and with a "
"fixed lifetime. During its lifetime, every particle will have the same base "
"behavior. What makes each particle different from the rest and provides a "
"more organic look is the \"randomness\" associated with each parameter. In "
"essence, creating a particle system means setting base physics parameters "
"and then adding randomness to them."

"Godot provides two different nodes for 2D particles, :ref:"
"`class_Particles2D` and :ref:`class_CPUParticles2D`. Particles2D is more "
"advanced and uses the GPU to process particle effects, but that limits it to "
"higher end graphics API, and in our case to the GLES3 renderer. For projects "
"using the GLES2 backend, CPUParticles2D is a CPU-driven option with near "
"feature parity with Particles2D, but lesser performance. While Particles2D "
"is configured via a :ref:`class_ParticlesMaterial` (and optionally with a "
"custom shader), the matching options are provided via node properties in "
"CPUParticles2D (with the exception of the trail settings). You can convert a "
"Particles2D node into a CPUParticles2D node by clicking on the node in the "
"inspector, and selecting \"Convert to CPUParticles2D\" in the \"Particles\" "
"menu of the toolbar."

"Godot fornisce due diversi nodi per particelle 2D, :ref: `class_Particles2D` "
"e :ref:` class_CPUParticles2D`. Particles2D è più avanzato e utilizza la GPU "
"per elaborare gli effetti delle particelle, ma ciò lo limita all'API grafica "
"di fascia più alta, e nel nostro caso al renderer GLES3. Per i progetti che "
"utilizzano il backend GLES2, CPUParticles2D è un'opzione guidata dalla CPU "
"con parità di funzionalità vicina a Particles2D, ma con prestazioni "
"inferiori. Mentre Particles2D è configurato tramite a :ref: "
"`class_ParticlesMaterial` (e facoltativamente con uno shader "
"personalizzato), le opzioni di corrispondenza sono fornite tramite le "
"proprietà del nodo in CPUParticles2D (ad eccezione delle impostazioni del "
"trail). Puoi convertire un nodo Particles2D in un nodo CPUParticles2D "
"facendo clic sul nodo nella finestra di ispezione e selezionando \"Converti "
