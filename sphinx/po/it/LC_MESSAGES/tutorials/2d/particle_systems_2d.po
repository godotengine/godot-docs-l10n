"Particle systems are used to simulate complex physical effects, such as "
"sparks, fire, magic particles, smoke, mist, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The idea is that a \"particle\" is emitted at a fixed interval and with a "
"fixed lifetime. During its lifetime, every particle will have the same base "
"behavior. What makes each particle different from the rest and provides a "
"more organic look is the \"randomness\" associated with each parameter. In "
"essence, creating a particle system means setting base physics parameters "
"and then adding randomness to them."

"Godot provides two different nodes for 2D particles, :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticles2D` and :ref:`class_CPUParticles2D`. GPUParticles2D is "
"more advanced and uses the GPU to process particle effects. CPUParticles2D "
"is a CPU-driven option with near-feature parity with GPUParticles2D, but "
"lower performance when using large amounts of particles. On the other hand, "
"CPUParticles2D may perform better on low-end systems or in GPU-bottlenecked "
"situations."
msgstr ""
"Godot fornisce due diversi nodi per particelle 2D, :ref: `class_Particles2D` "
"e :ref:` class_CPUParticles2D`. Particles2D è più avanzato e utilizza la GPU "
"per elaborare gli effetti delle particelle, ma ciò lo limita all'API grafica "
"di fascia più alta, e nel nostro caso al renderer GLES3. Per i progetti che "
"utilizzano il backend GLES2, CPUParticles2D è un'opzione guidata dalla CPU "
"con parità di funzionalità vicina a Particles2D, ma con prestazioni "
"inferiori. Mentre Particles2D è configurato tramite a :ref: "
"`class_ParticlesMaterial` (e facoltativamente con uno shader "
"personalizzato), le opzioni di corrispondenza sono fornite tramite le "
"proprietà del nodo in CPUParticles2D (ad eccezione delle impostazioni del "
"trail). Puoi convertire un nodo Particles2D in un nodo CPUParticles2D "
"facendo clic sul nodo nella finestra di ispezione e selezionando \"Converti "
"in CPUParticles2D\" nel menu \"Particelle\" della barra degli strumenti."

msgid ""
"While GPUParticles2D is configured via a :ref:"
"`class_ParticleProcessMaterial` (and optionally with a custom shader), the "
"matching options are provided via node properties in CPUParticles2D (with "
"the exception of the trail settings)."

msgid ""
"You can convert a GPUParticles2D node into a CPUParticles2D node by clicking "

"CPUParticles2D** in the toolbar at the top of the 3D editor viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The rest of this tutorial is going to use the GPUParticles2D node. First, "
"add a GPUParticles2D node to your scene. After creating that node you will "
"notice that only a white dot was created, and that there is a warning icon "
"next to your GPUParticles2D node in the scene dock. This is because the node "
"needs a ParticleProcessMaterial to function."

msgstr "Preprocesso"

msgid ""
"Particle systems begin with zero particles emitted, then start emitting. "
"This can be an inconvenience when loading a scene and systems like a torch, "

msgid "Speed Scale"
msgstr "Scala della velocità"

"while increasing the value will make the particles much faster."
msgstr ""

msgid "Explosiveness"
msgstr "Esplosività"

msgid ""
"If lifetime is ``1`` and there are 10 particles, it means a particle will be "
"emitted every 0.1 seconds. The explosiveness parameter changes this, and "
"forces particles to be emitted all together. Ranges are:"
msgstr ""

"This setting can be used to set the particle system to render at a fixed "

"You can have Godot generate a Visibility Rect automatically using the "
"toolbar above the 2d view. To do so, select the GPUParticles2D node and "

"Particles2D node emitting particles for a few seconds and set the rectangle "
"to fit the surface the particles take."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can control the emit duration with the ``Generation Time (sec)`` option. "
"The maximum value is 25 seconds. If you need more time for your particles to "

msgid "Local Coords"

"For this property to be noticeable, you need an *initial velocity* greater "
