"As mentioned in the previous tutorial, :ref:`doc_canvas_layers`, every "
"CanvasItem node (remember that Node2D and Control based nodes use CanvasItem "
"as their common root) will reside in a *Canvas Layer*. Every canvas layer "
"has a transform (translation, rotation, scale, etc.) that can be accessed as "
"a :ref:`Transform2D <class_Transform2D>`."

"Viewports also have a Global Canvas transform (also a :ref:`Transform2D "

"individual *Canvas Layer* transforms. Generally, this transform is not of "

"Finally, viewports have a *Stretch Transform*, which is used when resizing "
