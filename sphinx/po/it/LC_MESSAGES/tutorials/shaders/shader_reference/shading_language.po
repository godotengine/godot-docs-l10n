"For matrices, use the ``m[column][row]`` indexing syntax to access each "

"It is possible to add precision modifiers to datatypes; use them for "

"Using lower precision for some operations can speed up the math involved (at "
"the cost of less precision). This is rarely needed in the vertex processor "
"function (where full precision is needed most of the time), but is often "
"useful in the fragment processor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some architectures (mainly mobile) can benefit significantly from this, but "
"there are downsides such as the additional overhead of conversion between "
"precisions. Refer to the documentation of the target architecture for "
"further information. In many cases, mobile drivers cause inconsistent or "
"unexpected behavior and it is best to avoid specifying precision unless "
"necessary."

msgid ""
"Arrays are containers for multiple variables of a similar type. Note: As of "
"Godot 3.2, only local and varying arrays have been implemented."
msgstr ""

msgid "Local arrays"
msgstr "Array locali"

msgid ""
"Local arrays are declared in functions. They can use all of the allowed "
"datatypes, except samplers. The array declaration follows a C-style syntax: "
"``[const] + [precision] + typename + identifier + [array size]``."
msgstr ""

msgid "They can be initialized at the beginning like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can declare multiple arrays (even with different sizes) in one "
"expression:"

msgid "To access an array element, use the indexing syntax:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Arrays also have a built-in function ``.length()`` (not to be confused with "
"the built-in ``length()`` function). It doesn't accept any parameters and "
"will return the array's size."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you use an index below 0 or greater than array size - the shader will "
"crash and break rendering. To prevent this, use ``length()``, ``if``, or "
"``clamp()`` functions to ensure the index is between 0 and the array's "
"length. Always carefully test and check your code. If you pass a constant "
"expression or a simple number, the editor will check its bounds to prevent "
"this crash."
msgstr ""

msgid "Constants"
msgstr "Costanti"

msgid ""
"Use the ``const`` keyword before the variable declaration to make that "
"variable immutable, which means that it cannot be modified. All basic types, "
"except samplers can be declared as constants. Accessing and using a constant "
"value is slightly faster than using a uniform. Constants must be initialized "
"at their declaration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Constants cannot be modified and additionally cannot have hints, but "
"multiple of them (if they have the same type) can be declared in a single "
"expression e.g"
msgstr ""

msgid "Similar to variables, arrays can also be declared with ``const``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Constants can be declared both globally (outside of any function) or locally "
"(inside a function). Global constants are useful when you want to have "
"access to a value throughout your shader that does not need to be modified. "
