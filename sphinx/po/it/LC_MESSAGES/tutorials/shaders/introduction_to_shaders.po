"This page explains what shaders are and will give you an overview of how "
"they work in Godot. For a detailed reference of the engine's shading "
"language, see :ref:`doc_shading_language`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shaders are a special kind of program that runs on Graphics Processing Units "
"(GPUs). They were initially used to shade 3D scenes but can nowadays do much "
"more. You can use them to control how the engine draws geometry and pixels "
"on the screen, allowing you to achieve all sorts of effects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Modern rendering engines like Godot draw everything with shaders: graphics "
"cards can run thousands of instructions in parallel, leading to incredible "
"rendering speed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because of their parallel nature, though, shaders don't process information "
"the way a typical program does. Shader code runs on each vertex or pixel in "
"isolation. You cannot store data between frames either. As a result, when "
"working with shaders, you need to code and think differently from other "
"programming languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Suppose you want to update all the pixels in a texture to a given color. In "
"GDScript, your code would use ``for`` loops::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your code is already part of a loop in a shader, so the corresponding code "
"would look like this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The graphics card calls the ``fragment()`` function once or more for each "
"pixel it has to draw. More on that below."

msgid "Shaders in Godot"
msgstr "Impostare"

msgid ""
"Godot provides a shading language based on the popular OpenGL Shading "
"Language (GLSL) but simplified. The engine handles some of the lower-level "
"initialization work for you, making it easier to write complex shaders."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot, shaders are made up of main functions called \"processor "
"functions\". Processor functions are the entry point for your shader into "
"the program. There are seven different processor functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``vertex()`` function runs over all the vertices in the mesh and sets "
"their positions and some other per-vertex variables. Used in :ref:"
"`canvas_item shaders <doc_canvas_item_shader>` and :ref:`spatial shaders "
"<doc_spatial_shader>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``fragment()`` function runs for every pixel covered by the mesh. It "
"uses values output by the ``vertex()`` function, interpolated between the "
"vertices. Used in :ref:`canvas_item shaders <doc_canvas_item_shader>` and :"
"ref:`spatial shaders <doc_spatial_shader>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``light()`` function runs for every pixel and for every light. It takes "
"variables from the ``fragment()`` function and from its previous runs. Used "
"in :ref:`canvas_item shaders <doc_canvas_item_shader>` and :ref:`spatial "
"shaders <doc_spatial_shader>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``start()`` function runs for every particle in a particle system once "
"when the particle is first spawned. Used in :ref:`particles shaders "
"<doc_particle_shader>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``process()`` function runs for every particle in a particle system for "
"each frame. Used in :ref:`particles shaders <doc_particle_shader>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``sky()`` function runs for every pixel in the radiance cubemap when the "
"radiance cubemap needs to be updated, and for every pixel on the current "
"screen. Used in :ref:`sky shaders <doc_sky_shader>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``fog()`` function runs for every froxel in the volumetric fog froxel "
"buffer that intersects with the :ref:`FogVolume <class_FogVolume>`. Used by :"
"ref:`fog shaders <doc_fog_shader>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``light()`` function won't run if the ``vertex_lighting`` render mode is "
"enabled, or if **Rendering > Quality > Shading > Force Vertex Shading** is "
"enabled in the Project Settings. It's enabled by default on mobile platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot also exposes an API for users to write totally custom GLSL shaders. "

msgid "Shader types"
msgstr "Tipi di shader"

msgid ""
"Instead of supplying a general-purpose configuration for all uses (2D, 3D, "
"particles, sky, fog), you must specify the type of shader you're writing. "
"Different types support different render modes, built-in variables, and "
"processing functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot, all shaders need to specify their type in the first line, like so:"
msgstr ""

msgstr "Ecco i tipi disponibili:"

msgid ":ref:`spatial <doc_spatial_shader>` for 3D rendering."

msgid "Render modes"
msgstr "Modalità di rendering"

msgid ""
"Shaders have optional render modes you can specify on the second line, after "
"the shader type, like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Render modes alter the way Godot applies the shader. For example, the "
"``unshaded`` mode makes the engine skip the built-in light processor "
"function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each shader type has different render modes. See the reference for each "
"shader type for a complete list of render modes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Vertex processor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``vertex()`` processing function is called once for every vertex in "
"``spatial`` and ``canvas_item`` shaders. For ``particles`` shaders, it is "
"called once for every particle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each vertex in your world's geometry has properties like a position and "
"color. The function modifies those values and passes them to the fragment "
"function. You can also use it to send extra data to the fragment function "
"using varyings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, Godot transforms your vertex information for you, which is "
"necessary to project geometry onto the screen. You can use render modes to "
"transform the data yourself; see the :ref:`Spatial shader doc "
"<doc_spatial_shader>` for an example."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fragment processor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``fragment()`` processing function is used to set up the Godot material "
"parameters per pixel. This code runs on every visible pixel the object or "
"primitive draws. It is only available in ``spatial``, ``canvas_item``, and "
"``sky`` shaders."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The standard use of the fragment function is to set up material properties "
"used to calculate lighting. For example, you would set values for "
"``ROUGHNESS``, ``RIM``, or ``TRANSMISSION``, which would tell the light "
"function how the lights respond to that fragment. This makes it possible to "
"control a complex shading pipeline without the user having to write much "
"code. If you don't need this built-in functionality, you can ignore it and "
"write your own light processing function, and Godot will optimize it away. "
"For example, if you do not write a value to ``RIM``, Godot will not "
"calculate rim lighting. During compilation, Godot checks to see if ``RIM`` "
"is used; if not, it cuts all the corresponding code out. Therefore, you will "
"not waste calculations on the effects that you do not use."
msgstr ""
"L'uso standard della funzione fragment è quello di impostare le proprietà "
"del materiale che saranno usate per calcolare l'illuminazione. Per esempio, "
"si impostano i valori per ``ROUGHNESS``, ``RIM``, o ``TRANSMISSION`` che "
"indicano alla funzione luce come le luci rispondono a quel frammento. Questo "
"rende possibile il controllo di una complessa pipeline di shading senza che "
"l'utente debba scrivere molto codice. Se non avete bisogno di questa "
"funzionalità integrata, potete ignorarla e scrivere la vostra funzione di "
"elaborazione delle luci e Godot la ottimizzerà. Per esempio, se non si "
"scrive un valore su ``RIM``, Godot non calcolerà l'illuminazione del bordo. "
"Durante la compilazione, Godot controlla se ``RIM`` viene utilizzato; in "
"caso contrario, taglia fuori tutto il codice corrispondente. Pertanto, non "
"si sprecheranno i calcoli sugli effetti che non si usano."

msgid "Light processor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``light()`` processor runs per pixel too, and it runs once for every "
"light that affects the object. It does not run if no lights affect the "
"object. It exists as a function called inside the ``fragment()`` processor "
"and typically operates on the material properties setup inside the "
"``fragment()`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``light()`` processor works differently in 2D than it does in 3D; for a "
"description of how it works in each, see their documentation, :ref:"
"`CanvasItem shaders <doc_canvas_item_shader>` and :ref:`Spatial shaders "
"<doc_spatial_shader>`, respectively."
