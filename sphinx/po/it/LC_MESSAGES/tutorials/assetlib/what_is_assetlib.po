"The Godot Asset Library, otherwise known as the AssetLib, is a repository of "
"user-submitted Godot addons, scripts, tools and other resources, "
"collectively referred to as assets. They're available to all Godot users for "
"download directly from within the engine, but it can also be accessed at "
"Godot's `official website <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_."

"On the surface, the Asset Library might look and function similar to asset "
"stores available for other engines, such as Unity's Asset Store, or Unreal "
"Engine's Marketplace, where you can submit both freely-available assets, as "
"well as paid, commercial ones. In addition, often times such assets are "
"distributed under non-free, proprietary licenses, limiting what you can do "
"with them."

"The Asset Library is different - all assets are distributed free of charge, "
"and under a host of open-source licenses (such as the MIT license, the GPL, "
"and the Boost Software License). This makes the AssetLib more similar to the "
"software repositories of a Linux distribution."

"Please note that the AssetLib is relatively young - it may have various pain "
"points, bugs and usability issues. As with all Godot projects, the code "
"repository is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-"
"asset-library>`_, where you can submit pull requests and issues, so please "
"do not hesitate to visit it!"
