"AnimationPlayer inherits from Node instead of Node2D or Spatial, which means "

msgid ""
"Therefore, it is not recommended to add nodes that have a 2D/3D transform as "

"The sprite holds an image texture. We animate that sprite to move between "

"The update mode of a track tells Godot when to update the property values. "

msgid "**Continuous:** Update the property on each frame."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Discrete:** Only update the property on keyframes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Trigger:** Only update the property on keyframes or triggers. Triggers are "
"a type of keyframe used by the ``current_animation`` property of a :ref:"
"`class_AnimationPlayer`, and Animation Playback tracks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Capture:** If the first keyframe's time is greater than ``0.0``, the "
"current value of the property will be remembered and will be blended with "
"the first animation key. For example, you could use the Capture mode to move "
"a node that's located anywhere to a specific location."

msgid "Track mode"
msgstr "Modalità traccia"

msgid ""
"In normal animations, you usually use \"Continuous\". The other types are "

"The interpolation tells Godot how to calculate the frame values between the "
"keyframes. These interpolation modes are supported:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Nearest: Set the nearest keyframe value"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Linear: Set the value based on a linear function calculation between the two "
"keyframes"

msgid ""
"Cubic: Set the value based on a cubic function calculation between the two "
"keyframes"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Track interpolation"
msgstr "Interpolazione traccia"

msgid ""
"Cubic interpolation leads to a more natural movement, where the animation is "
"slower at a keyframe and faster between keyframes. This is usually used for "
"character animation. Linear interpolation creates more of a robotic movement."
msgstr ""

"Godot supports two loop modes, which affect the animation if it's set to "
"loop:"

"animation after the last keyframe to reach the values of the first keyframe "
"again."

msgid "Keyframes for other properties"

msgid ""
"Godot doesn't restrict you to only edit transform properties. Every property "
"can be used as a track where you can set keyframes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select your sprite while the animation panel is visible, you get a "
"small keyframe button for all the sprite's properties. Click on this button "
"and Godot automatically adds a track and keyframe to the current animation."

#, fuzzy
msgid "Edit keyframes"
msgstr "Modifica fotogrammi chiave"

"For advanced use and to edit keyframes in detail, You can click on them to "
"bring up the keyframe editor in the inspector. You can use this to directly "
"edit its values."
msgstr ""

msgid "Keyframe editor editing a key"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, you can also edit the easing value for this keyframe by "
"clicking and dragging the easing setting. This tells Godot, how to change "
"the property values when it reaches this keyframe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You usually tweak your animations this way, when the movement doesn't \"look "
"right\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advanced: Call Method tracks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's animation engine doesn't stop here. If you're already comfortable "
"with Godot's scripting language :ref:`doc_gdscript` and :doc:`/classes/"
"index` you know that each node type is a class and has a bunch of callable "
"methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the :ref:`class_AudioStreamPlayer` node type has a method to "
"play an audio stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wouldn't it be great to use a method at a specific keyframe in an animation? "
"This is where \"Call Method Tracks\" come in handy. These tracks reference a "
"node again, this time without a reference to a property. Instead, a keyframe "
"holds the name and arguments of a method, that Godot should call when it "
"reaches this keyframe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To demonstrate, we're going to use a call method track to play audio at a "
"specific keyframe. Normally to play audio you should use an audio track, but "
"for the sake of demonstrating methods we're going to do it this way."

"Add a :ref:`class_AudioStreamPlayer` to the Scene Tree and setup a stream "
"using an audio file you put in your project."

msgid "Using RESET tracks"
msgstr "Aggiungere una traccia"

msgid ""
"You can set up a special *RESET* animation to contain the \"default pose\". "
"This is used to ensure that the default pose is restored when you save the "
"scene and open it again in the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For existing tracks, you can add an animation called \"RESET\" (case-"
"sensitive), then add tracks for each property that you want to reset. The "
"only keyframe should be at time 0, and give it the desired default value for "
"each track."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If AnimationPlayer's **Reset On Save** property is set to ``true``, the "
"scene will be saved with the effects of the reset animation applied (as if "
"it had been seeked to time ``0.0``). This only affects the saved file – the "
"property tracks in the editor stay where they were."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to reset the tracks in the editor, select the AnimationPlayer "
"node, open the **Animation** bottom panel then choose **Apply Reset** in the "
"animation editor's **Animation** dropdown menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When adding tracks on new animations, the editor will ask you to "
"automatically create a RESET track when using the keyframe icon next to a "
"property in the inspector. This does not apply on tracks created with Godot "
"versions prior to 3.4, as the animation reset track feature was added in 3.4."
