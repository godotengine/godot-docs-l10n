"As you might have already read in :ref:`doc_audio_buses`, sound is sent to "
"each bus via an AudioStreamPlayer node. There are different kinds of "
"AudioStreamPlayers. Each one loads an AudioStream and plays it back."

msgid ""
"An audio stream is an abstract object that emits sound. The sound can come "
"from many places, but is most commonly loaded from the filesystem. Audio "
"files can be loaded as AudioStreams and placed inside an AudioStreamPlayer. "
"You can find information on supported formats and differences in :ref:"
"`doc_importing_audio_samples`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are other types of AudioStreams, such as AudioStreamRandomPitch. This "
"one makes a random adjustment to the sound's pitch every time it's played "
"back. This can be helpful for adding variation to sounds that are played "
"back often."
msgstr ""

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer"

msgid ""
"This is the standard, non-positional stream player. It can play to any bus. "
"In 5.1 sound setups, it can send audio to stereo mix or front speakers."
msgstr ""

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer2D"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer2D"

msgid ""
"This is a variant of AudioStreamPlayer, but emits sound in a 2D positional "
"environment. When close to the left of the screen, the panning will go left. "
"When close to the right side, it will go right."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Area2Ds can be used to divert sound from any AudioStreamPlayer2Ds they "
"contain to specific buses. This makes it possible to create buses with "
"different reverb or sound qualities to handle action happening in a "
"particular parts of your game world."
msgstr ""

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer3D"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer3D"

msgid ""
"This is a variant of AudioStreamPlayer, but emits sound in a 3D positional "
"environment. Depending on the location of the player relative to the screen, "
"it can position sound in stereo, 5.1 or 7.1 depending on the chosen audio "
"setup."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to AudioStreamPlayer2D, an Area can divert the sound to an audio bus."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike for 2D, the 3D version of AudioStreamPlayer has a few more advanced "

msgid "Reverb buses"
msgstr "Bus di riverbero"

msgid ""
"Godot allows for 3D audio streams that enter a specific Area node to send "
"dry and wet audio to separate buses. This is useful when you have several "
"reverb configurations for different types of rooms. This is done by enabling "
"this type of reverb in the **Reverb Bus** section of the Area's properties:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the same time, a special bus layout is created where each area receives "
"the reverb info from each area. A Reverb effect needs to be created and "
"configured in each reverb bus to complete the setup for the desired effect:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Area's **Reverb Bus** section also has a parameter named **Uniformity**. "
"Some types of rooms bounce sounds more than others (like a warehouse), so "
"reverberation can be heard almost uniformly across the room even though the "
"source may be far away. Playing around with this parameter can simulate that "
"effect."
msgstr ""

msgid "Doppler"
msgstr "Doppler"

msgid ""
"When the relative velocity between an emitter and listener changes, this is "
"perceived as an increase or decrease in the pitch of the emitted sound. "
"Godot can track velocity changes in the AudioStreamPlayer3D and Camera "
"nodes. Both nodes have this property, which must be enabled manually:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enable it by setting it depending on how objects will be moved: use **Idle** "
"for objects moved using ``_process``, or **Physics** for objects moved using "
"``_physics_process``. The tracking will happen automatically."
