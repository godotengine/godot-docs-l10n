"In any application or game, sound and music playback will have a slight "
"delay. For games, this delay is often so small that it is negligible. Sound "
"effects will come out a few milliseconds after any play() function is "
"called. For music this does not matter as in most games it does not interact "
"with the gameplay."

"Still, for some games (mainly, rhythm games), it may be required to "
"synchronize player actions with something happening in a song (usually in "
"sync with the BPM). For this, having more precise timing information for an "
"exact playback position is useful."

"Achieving very low playback timing precision is difficult. This is because "

"The most common way to reduce latency is to shrink the audio buffers (again, "
"by editing the latency setting in the project settings). The problem is that "
"when latency is too small, sound mixing will require considerably more CPU. "
"This increases the risk of skipping (a crack in sound because a mix callback "
"was lost)."

"The problem, in the end, is not this slight delay but synchronizing graphics "
"and audio for games that require it. Beginning with Godot 3.2, some helpers "

"For a rhythm game where a song begins and ends after a few minutes, this "

"playback can last a much longer time, the game will eventually go out of "
"sync and a different approach is needed."

"get_playback_position()<class_AudioStreamPlayer_method_get_playback_position>` "
"to obtain the current position for the song sounds ideal, but it's not that "
"useful as-is. This value will increment in chunks (every time the audio "
"callback mixed a block of sound), so many calls can return the same value. "

"The result may be a bit jittery due how multiple threads work. Just check "
