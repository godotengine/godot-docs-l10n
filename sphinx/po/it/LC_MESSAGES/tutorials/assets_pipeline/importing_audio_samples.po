"Godot provides three options to import your audio data: WAV, Ogg Vorbis and "
"MP3."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each has different advantages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"WAV files use raw data or light compression (IMA-ADPCM). They are "
"lightweight on the CPU to play back (hundreds of simultaneous voices in this "
"format are fine). The downside is that they take up a lot of disk space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ogg Vorbis files use a stronger compression that results in much smaller "
"file size, but require significantly more processing power to play back."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"MP3 files use better compression than WAV with IMA-ADPCM, but worse than Ogg "
"Vorbis. This means that a MP3 file with roughly equal quality to Ogg Vorbis "
"will be significantly larger. On the bright side, MP3 requires less CPU "
"usage to play back compared to Ogg Vorbis. This makes MP3 useful for mobile "
"and HTML5 projects where CPU resources are limited, especially when playing "
"multiple compressed sounds at the same time (such as long ambient sounds)."

"Godot has an :ref:`extensive bus system <doc_audio_buses>` with built-in "
"effects. This saves SFX artists the need to add reverb to the sound effects, "
"reducing their size greatly and ensuring correct trimming. Say no to SFX "
"with baked reverb!"

"One issue that happens often is that the waveform is exported with long "
"silences at the beginning and at the end. These are inserted by DAWs when "
"saving to a waveform, increase their size unnecessarily and add latency to "
"the moment they are played back."

"Godot supports looping in the samples (tools such as Sound Forge or Audition "
"can add loop points to WAV files). This is useful for sound effects, such as "
"engines, machine guns etc. Ping-pong looping is also supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As an alternative, the Import dock has a **Loop** option that enables "
"looping for the entire sample when importing."
