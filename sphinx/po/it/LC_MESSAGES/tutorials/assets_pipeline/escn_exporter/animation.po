msgid "Multiple Actions For Single Object"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most games, one object would have several animations to switch between. "
"This add-on has support for exporting multiple actions all at once into a "
"single AnimationPlayer and makes it easy to switch actions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This workflow makes use of blender nla_tracks. Here is a brief guide on how "
"to use this feature:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**1. Stash active action**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"New created action is always an active action bound to object. There are "
"several ways to place an active action into NLA track, one is of course "
"doing it in ``NLA Editor``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Or it can be done stashing the action in ``Dope Sheet``"
msgstr ""

msgid "**2. Check mute status of NLA tracks**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An NLA track can be ``mute`` or ``unmute``, the exporter will export all the "
"``mute`` NLA track as a separate action, while blends all the ``unmute`` NLA "
"tracks into every action (including the action action) being exported."
msgstr ""

msgid "**3. Export the scene**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure the ``Export Stashed Actions`` option has been turned on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then all the stashed actions, as well as the active action, are exported to "
"an AnimationPlayer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Constraints"
msgstr "Vincoli"

msgid ""
"Sometimes complicated animation is built with object constraint; a usual "
"example is inverse kinematics. The add-on would automatically check if an "
"object has some constraint; if it does, all the constraints are baked into "
"actions and then exported along with the object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Animation Mode"
msgstr "Modalit√† di animazione"

msgid ""
"Godot and Blender have different structure to store animation data. In Godot "
"animation data is stored in an AnimationPlayer node, instead of in each "
"animated node. In order to fix this inconsistence and still make the "
"animation play versatile, this add-on has three animation exporting modes."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Mode 'Animation as Actions'**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Treat all the animations as object actions, so in the exported scene, every "
"object would have its own AnimationPlayer and hold its actions."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Mode 'Scene Animation'**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want your animation to generate the same result as playing at "
"Blender's timeline, this is what you want. In this mode, all the animations "
"in the scene are placed in just one AnimationPlayer in the scene root."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Mode 'Animation as Action with Squash'**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This mode has very similar behavior of mode 'Animation as Action', but it "
"can generate fewer AnimationPlayers; objects in parent-children relationship "
"would share their AnimationPlayer. It is useful when you have several rigs, "
"and each Skeleton and Mesh has actions; then one rig would have just one "
"AnimationPlayer."
