msgid ""
"Godot offers several collision objects to provide both collision detection "
"and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your project can be "
"confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if you understand "
"how each of them works and what their pros and cons are. In this tutorial, "
"we'll look at the :ref:`KinematicBody2D <class_KinematicBody2D>` node and "
"show some examples of how to use it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This document assumes you're familiar with Godot's various physics bodies. "
"Please read :ref:`doc_physics_introduction` first."
msgstr ""

msgid "What is a kinematic body?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``KinematicBody2D`` is for implementing bodies that are controlled via code. "
"Kinematic bodies detect collisions with other bodies when moving, but are "
"not affected by engine physics properties, like gravity or friction. While "
"this means that you have to write some code to create their behavior, it "
"also means you have more precise control over how they move and react."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A `KinematicBody2D` can be affected by gravity and other forces, but you "
"must calculate the movement in code. The physics engine will not move a "
"`KinematicBody2D`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Movement and collision"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When moving a ``KinematicBody2D``, you should not set its ``position`` "
"property directly. Instead, you use the ``move_and_collide()`` or "
"``move_and_slide()`` methods. These methods move the body along a given "
"vector and instantly stop if a collision is detected with another body. "
"After a KinematicBody2D has collided, any *collision response* must be coded "
"manually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should only do Kinematic body movement in the ``_physics_process()`` "
"callback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The two movement methods serve different purposes, and later in this "
"tutorial, you'll see examples of how they work."
msgstr ""

msgid "``move_and_collide``"
msgstr "``move_and_collide``"

msgid ""
"This method takes one parameter: a :ref:`Vector2 <class_Vector2>` indicating "
"the body's relative movement. Typically, this is your velocity vector "
"multiplied by the frame timestep (``delta``). If the engine detects a "
"collision anywhere along this vector, the body will immediately stop moving. "
"If this happens, the method will return a :ref:`KinematicCollision2D "
"<class_KinematicCollision2D>` object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``KinematicCollision2D`` is an object containing data about the collision "
"and the colliding object. Using this data, you can calculate your collision "
"response."
msgstr ""

msgid "``move_and_slide``"
msgstr "``move_and_slide``"

msgid ""
"The ``move_and_slide()`` method is intended to simplify the collision "
"response in the common case where you want one body to slide along the "
"other. It is especially useful in platformers or top-down games, for example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``move_and_slide()`` automatically calculates frame-based movement using "
"``delta``. Do *not* multiply your velocity vector by ``delta`` before "
"passing it to ``move_and_slide()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition to the velocity vector, ``move_and_slide()`` takes a number of "
"other parameters allowing you to customize the slide behavior:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``up_direction`` - *default value:* ``Vector2( 0, 0 )``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This parameter allows you to define what surfaces the engine should consider "
"being the floor. Setting this lets you use the ``is_on_floor()``, "
"``is_on_wall()``, and ``is_on_ceiling()`` methods to detect what type of "
"surface the body is in contact with. The default value means that all "
"surfaces are considered walls."
msgstr ""

msgid "``stop_on_slope`` - *default value:* ``false``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This parameter prevents a body from sliding down slopes when standing still."
msgstr ""

msgid "``max_slides`` - *default value:* ``4``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This parameter is the maximum number of collisions before the body stops "
"moving. Setting it too low may prevent movement entirely."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``floor_max_angle`` - *default value:* ``0.785398`` (in radians, equivalent "
"to ``45`` degrees)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This parameter is the maximum angle before a surface is no longer considered "
"a \"floor.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "``infinite_inertia`` - *default value:* ``true``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When this parameter is ``true``, the body can push :ref:`RigidBody2D "
"<class_RigidBody2D>` nodes, ignoring their mass, but won't detect collisions "
"with them. If it's ``false`` the body will collide with rigid bodies and "
"stop."
msgstr ""

msgid "``move_and_slide_with_snap``"
msgstr "``move_and_slide_with_snap``"

msgid ""
"This method adds some additional functionality to ``move_and_slide()`` by "
"adding the ``snap`` parameter. As long as this vector is in contact with the "
"ground, the body will remain attached to the surface. Note that this means "
"you must disable snapping when jumping, for example. You can do this either "
"by setting ``snap`` to ``Vector2.ZERO`` or by using ``move_and_slide()`` "
"instead."

msgid "Detecting collisions"
msgstr "Preparazione per le collisioni"

msgid ""
"When using ``move_and_collide()`` the function returns a "
"``KinematicCollision2D`` directly, and you can use this in your code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using ``move_and_slide()`` it's possible to have multiple collisions "
"occur, as the slide response is calculated. To process these collisions, use "
"``get_slide_count()`` and ``get_slide_collision()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`get_slide_count()` only counts times the body has collided and changed "
"direction."
msgstr ""

"See :ref:`KinematicCollision2D <class_KinematicCollision2D>` for details on "
"what collision data is returned."

msgid "Which movement method to use?"
msgstr "Quale metodo di movimento usare?"

msgid ""
"A common question from new Godot users is: \"How do you decide which "
"movement function to use?\" Often, the response is to use "
"``move_and_slide()`` because it's \"simpler,\" but this is not necessarily "
"the case. One way to think of it is that ``move_and_slide()`` is a special "
"case, and ``move_and_collide()`` is more general. For example, the following "
"two code snippets result in the same collision response:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Anything you do with ``move_and_slide()`` can also be done with "
"``move_and_collide()``, but it might take a little more code. However, as "
"we'll see in the examples below, there are cases where ``move_and_slide()`` "
"doesn't provide the response you want."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the example above, we assign the velocity that ``move_and_slide()`` "
"returns back into the ``velocity`` variable. This is because when the "
"character collides with the environment, the function recalculates the speed "
"internally to reflect the slowdown."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, if your character fell on the floor, you don't want it to "
"accumulate vertical speed due to the effect of gravity. Instead, you want "
"its vertical speed to reset to zero."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``move_and_slide()`` may also recalculate the kinematic body's velocity "
"several times in a loop as, to produce a smooth motion, it moves the "
"character and collides up to five times by default. At the end of the "
"process, the function returns the character's new velocity that we can store "
"in our ``velocity`` variable, and use on the next frame."

"For this example, add a ``KinematicBody2D`` with two children: a ``Sprite`` "
"and a ``CollisionShape2D``. Use the Godot \"icon.png\" as the Sprite's "
"texture (drag it from the Filesystem dock to the *Texture* property of the "
"``Sprite``). In the ``CollisionShape2D``'s *Shape* property, select \"New "
"RectangleShape2D\" and size the rectangle to fit over the sprite image."

"Run this scene and you'll see that ``move_and_collide()`` works as expected, "
"moving the body along the velocity vector. Now let's see what happens when "
"you add some obstacles. Add a :ref:`StaticBody2D <class_StaticBody2D>` with "
"a rectangular collision shape. For visibility, you can use a sprite, a "
"Polygon2D, or turn on \"Visible Collision Shapes\" from the \"Debug\" menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Run the scene again and try moving into the obstacle. You'll see that the "
"``KinematicBody2D`` can't penetrate the obstacle. However, try moving into "
"the obstacle at an angle and you'll find that the obstacle acts like glue - "
"it feels like the body gets stuck."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This happens because there is no *collision response*. "
"``move_and_collide()`` stops the body's movement when a collision occurs. We "
"need to code whatever response we want from the collision."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Try changing the function to ``move_and_slide(velocity)`` and running again. "
"Note that we removed ``delta`` from the velocity calculation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``move_and_slide()`` provides a default collision response of sliding the "
"body along the collision object. This is useful for a great many game types, "
"and may be all you need to get the behavior you want."

"What if you don't want a sliding collision response? For this example "
"(\"BounceandCollide.tscn\" in the sample project), we have a character "
"shooting bullets and we want the bullets to bounce off the walls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This example uses three scenes. The main scene contains the Player and "
"Walls. The Bullet and Wall are separate scenes so that they can be instanced."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Player is controlled by the `w` and `s` keys for forward and back. "
"Aiming uses the mouse pointer. Here is the code for the Player, using "

"The action happens in ``_physics_process()``. After using "

msgid "Platformer movement"
msgstr "Movimento platform"

msgid ""
"Let's try one more popular example: the 2D platformer. ``move_and_slide()`` "

"\"Platformer.tscn\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For this example, we'll assume you have a level made of ``StaticBody2D`` "

"ref:`Polygon2D <class_Polygon2D>` to create the platform shapes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's the code for the player body:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using ``move_and_slide()``, the function returns a vector representing "
"the movement that remained after the slide collision occurred. Setting that "
"value back to the character's ``velocity`` allows us to move up and down "
"slopes smoothly. Try removing ``velocity =`` and see what happens if you "
"don't do this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also note that we've added ``Vector2(0, -1)`` as the floor normal. This "
"vector points straight upward. As a result, if the character collides with "
"an object that has this normal, it will be considered a floor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using the floor normal allows us to make jumping work, using "
"``is_on_floor()``. This function will only return ``true`` after a "
"``move_and_slide()`` collision where the colliding body's normal is within "
"45 degrees of the given floor vector. You can control the maximum angle by "
"setting ``floor_max_angle``."
