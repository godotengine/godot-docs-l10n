"Sería excelente que el mundo hablara solo un idioma (It would be great if "
"the world spoke only one language). Unfortunately for us developers, that is "
"not the case. While indie or niche games usually do not need localization, "
"games targeting a more massive market often require localization. Godot "
"offers many tools to make this process more straightforward, so this "
"tutorial is more like a collection of tips and tricks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Localization is usually done by specific studios hired for the job and, "
"despite the huge amount of software and file formats available for this, the "
"most common way to do localization to this day is still with spreadsheets. "
"The process of creating the spreadsheets and importing them is already "
"covered in the :ref:`doc_importing_translations` tutorial, so this one could "
"be seen more like a follow-up to that one."

"We will be using the official demo as an example; you can `download it from "
"the Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/134>`_."

"Translations can get updated and re-imported when they change, but they "
"still have to be added to the project. This is done in **Project → Project "
"Settings → Localization**:"

msgid "Localizing resources"
msgstr "Localizzazione delle risorse"

msgid ""
"It is also possible to instruct Godot to use alternate versions of assets "
"(resources) depending on the current language. The **Remaps** tab can be "
"used for this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select the resource to be remapped, then add some alternatives for each "
"locale."

msgid "Converting keys to text"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some controls, such as :ref:`Button <class_Button>` and :ref:`Label "
"<class_Label>`, will automatically fetch a translation if their text matches "
"a translation key. For example, if a label's text is "
"\"MAIN_SCREEN_GREETING1\" and that key exists in the current translation, "
"then the text will automatically be translated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This automatic translation behavior may be undesirable in certain cases. For "
"instance, when using a Label to display a player's name, you most likely "
"don't want the player's name to be translated if it matches a translation "
"key. To disable automatic translation on a specific node, use :ref:`Object."
"set_message_translation<class_Object_method_set_message_translation>` and "
"send a :ref:`Object.notification<class_Object_method_notification>` to "
"update the translation::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more complex UI nodes such as OptionButtons, you may have to use this "
"instead::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In code, the :ref:`Object.tr() <class_Object_method_tr>` function can be "
"used. This will just look up the text in the translations and convert it if "
"found:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Making controls resizable"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same text in different languages can vary greatly in length. For this, "
"make sure to read the tutorial on :ref:`doc_size_and_anchors`, as "
"dynamically adjusting control sizes may help. :ref:`Container "
"<class_Container>` can be useful, as well as the text wrapping options "
"available in :ref:`Label <class_Label>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "TranslationServer"
msgstr "TranslationServer"

msgid ""
"Godot has a server handling low-level translation management called the :ref:"
"`TranslationServer <class_TranslationServer>`. Translations can be added or "
"removed during run-time; the current language can also be changed at run-"
"time."

msgid "Testing translations"
msgstr "Test delle traduzioni"

msgid ""
"You may want to test a project's translation before releasing it. Godot "
"provides two ways to do this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, in the Project Settings, under **Input Devices > Locale**, there is a "
"**Test** property. Set this property to the locale code of the language you "
"want to test. Godot will run the project with that locale when the project "
"is run (either from the editor or when exported)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that since this is a project setting, it will show up in "
"version control when it is set to a non-empty value. Therefore, it should be "
"set back to an empty value before committing changes to version control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Translations can also be tested when running Godot from the command line. "
"For example, to test a game in French, the following argument can be "
"supplied:"

msgstr "Tradurre il nome del progetto"

msgid ""
"The project name becomes the app name when exporting to different operating "
"systems and platforms. To specify the project name in more than one "
"language, create a new setting ``application/name`` in the **Project "
"Settings** and append the locale identifier to it. For instance, for "
"Spanish, this would be ``application/name_es``:"
