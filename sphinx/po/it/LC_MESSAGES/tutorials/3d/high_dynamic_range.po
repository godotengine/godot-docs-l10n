msgid ""
"Normally, an artist does all the 3D modelling, then all the texturing, looks "
"at their awesome looking model in the 3D DCC and says \"looks fantastic, "
"ready for integration!\" then goes into the game, lighting is setup and the "
"game runs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So at what point does all this \"HDR\" business come into play? To "
"understand the answer, we need to look at how displays behave."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your display outputs linear light ratios from some maximum to some minimum "
"intensity. Modern game engines perform complex math on linear light values "
"in their respective scenes. So what's the problem?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The display has a limited range of intensity, depending on the display type. "
"The game engine renders to an unlimited range of intensity values, however. "
"While \"maximum intensity\" means something to an sRGB display, it has no "
"bearing in the game engine; there is only a potentially infinitely wide "
"range of intensity values generated per frame of rendering."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means that some transformation of the scene light intensity, also known "
"as *scene-referred* light ratios, need to be transformed and mapped to fit "
"within the particular output range of the chosen display. This can be most "
"easily understood if we consider virtually photographing our game engine "
"scene through a virtual camera. Here, our virtual camera would apply a "
"particular camera rendering transform to the scene data, and the output "
"would be ready for display on a particular display type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot does not support high dynamic range *output* yet. It can only perform "
"lighting in HDR and tonemap the result to a low dynamic range image."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For advanced users, it is still possible to get a non-tonemapped image of "
"the viewport with full HDR data, which can then be saved to an OpenEXR file."

msgid "Computer displays"
msgstr "Display del computer"

msgid ""
"Almost all displays require a nonlinear encoding for the code values sent to "
"them. The display in turn, using its unique transfer characteristic, "
"\"decodes\" the code value into linear light ratios of output, and projects "
"the ratios out of the uniquely colored lights at each reddish, greenish, and "
"blueish emission site."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a majority of computer displays, the specifications of the display are "
"outlined in accordance with IEC 61966-2-1, also known as the 1996 sRGB "
"specification. This specification outlines how an sRGB display is to behave, "
"including the color of the lights in the LED pixels as well as the transfer "
"characteristics of the input (OETF) and output (EOTF)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Not all displays use the same OETF and EOTF as a computer display. For "
"example, television broadcast displays use the BT.1886 EOTF. However, Godot "
"currently only supports sRGB displays."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The sRGB standard is based around the nonlinear relationship between the "
"current to light output of common desktop computing CRT displays."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The mathematics of a scene-referred model require that we multiply the scene "
"by different values to adjust the intensities and exposure to different "
"light ranges. The transfer function of the display can't appropriately "
"render the wider dynamic range of the game engine's scene output using the "
"simple transfer function of the display. A more complex approach to encoding "
"is required."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scene linear & asset pipelines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Working in scene-linear sRGB is not as simple as just pressing a switch. "
"First, imported image assets must be converted to linear light ratios on "
"import. Even when linearized, those assets may not be perfectly well-suited "
"for use as textures, depending on how they were generated."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are two ways to do this:"
msgstr "Ci sono due modi per farlo:"

msgid "sRGB transfer function to display linear ratios on image import"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the easiest method of using sRGB assets, but it's not the most "
"ideal. One issue with this is loss of quality. Using 8 bits per channel to "
"represent linear light ratios is not sufficient to quantize the values "
"correctly. These textures may also be compressed later, which can exacerbate "
"the problem."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hardware sRGB transfer function to display linear conversion"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GPU will do the conversion after reading the texel using floating-point. "
"This works fine on PC and consoles, but most mobile devices don't support "
"it, or they don't support it on compressed texture formats (iOS for example)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scene linear to display-referred nonlinear"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After all the rendering is done, the scene linear render requires "
"transforming to a suitable output such as an sRGB display. To do this, "
"enable sRGB conversion in the current :ref:`Environment <class_Environment>` "
"(more on that below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that the **sRGB -> Display Linear** and **Display Linear -> "
"sRGB** conversions must always be **both** enabled. Failing to enable one of "
"them will result in horrible visuals suitable only for avant-garde "
"experimental indie games."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameters of HDR"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"HDR settings can be found in the :ref:`Environment <class_Environment>` "
"resource. Most of the time, these are found inside a :ref:`WorldEnvironment "
"<class_WorldEnvironment>` node or set in a Camera node. For more "
"information, see :ref:`doc_environment_and_post_processing`."
