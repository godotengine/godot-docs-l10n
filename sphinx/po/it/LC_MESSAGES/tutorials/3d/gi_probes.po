msgid "Using GIProbe"
msgstr "Utilizzo di GIProbe"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Introduzione"

msgid ""
"This feature is only available when using the GLES3 backend. :ref:"
"`doc_baked_lightmaps` can be used as an alternative when using the GLES2 "
"renderer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Just like with :ref:`doc_reflection_probes`, and as stated in the :ref:"
"`doc_spatial_material`, objects can show reflected or diffuse light. GI "
"Probes are similar to Reflection Probes, but they use a different and more "
"complex technique to produce indirect light and reflections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The strength of GI Probes is real-time, high quality, indirect light. While "
"the scene needs a quick pre-bake for the static objects that will be used, "
"lights can be added, changed or removed, and this will be updated in real-"
"time. Dynamic objects that move within one of these probes will also receive "
"indirect lighting from the scene automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Just like with ``ReflectionProbe``, ``GIProbe`` can be blended (in a bit "
"more limited way), so it is possible to provide full real-time lighting for "
"a stage without having to resort to lightmaps."
msgstr ""

msgid "The main downsides of ``GIProbe`` are:"
msgstr "I principali svantaggi di ``GIProbe`` sono:"

msgid ""
"A small amount of light leaking can occur if the level is not carefully "
"designed. This must be artist-tweaked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Performance requirements are higher than for lightmaps, so it may not run "
"properly in low-end integrated GPUs (may need to reduce resolution)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Reflections are voxelized, so they don't look as sharp as with "
"``ReflectionProbe``. However, in exchange they are volumetric, so any room "
"size or shape works for them. Mixing them with Screen Space Reflection also "
"works well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They consume considerably more video memory than Reflection Probes, so they "
"must be used with care in the right subdivision sizes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting up"
msgstr "Impostare"

msgid ""
"Just like a ``ReflectionProbe``, simply set up the ``GIProbe`` by wrapping "
"it around the geometry that will be affected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Afterwards, make sure to enable the **Use In Baked Light** property on the "
"geometry instances in the inspector. This is required for ``GIProbe`` to "
"recognize objects, otherwise they will be ignored:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the geometry is set up, push the Bake button that appears on the 3D "
"editor toolbar to begin the pre-baking process:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Meshes should have sufficiently thick walls to avoid light leaks (avoid one-"
"sided walls). For interior levels, enclose your level geometry in a "
"sufficiently large box and bridge the loops to close the mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding lights"
msgstr "Aggiunta di luci"

msgid ""
"Unless there are materials with emission, ``GIProbe`` does nothing by "
"default. Lights need to be added to the scene to have an effect."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The effect of indirect light can be viewed quickly (it is recommended you "
"turn off all ambient/sky lighting to tweak this, though, as shown below):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In some situations, though, indirect light may be too weak. Lights have an "
"indirect multiplier to tweak this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And, as ``GIProbe`` lighting updates in real-time, this effect is immediate:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Reflections"
msgstr "Riflessi"

msgid ""
"For very metallic materials with low roughness, it's possible to appreciate "
"voxel reflections. Keep in mind that these have far less detail than "
"Reflection Probes or Screen Space Reflections, but fully reflect "
"volumetrically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``GIProbe``\\ s can be easily mixed with Reflection Probes and Screen Space "
"Reflections, as a full 3-stage fallback-chain. This allows to have precise "
"reflections where needed:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Interior vs exterior"
msgstr "Interno vs esterno"

msgid ""
"GI Probes normally allow mixing with lighting from the sky. This can be "
"disabled when turning on the *Interior* setting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The difference becomes clear in the image below, where light from the sky "
"goes from spreading inside to being ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As complex buildings may mix interiors with exteriors, combining GIProbes "
"for both parts works well."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tweaking"
msgstr "Ottimizzazione"

msgid "GI Probes support a few parameters for tweaking:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Subdiv** Subdivision used for the probe. The default (128) is generally "
"good for small- to medium-sized areas. Bigger subdivisions use more memory."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Extents** Size of the probe. Can be tweaked from the gizmo."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Dynamic Range** Maximum light energy the probe can absorb. Higher values "
"allow brighter light, but with less color detail."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Energy** Multiplier for all the probe. Can be used to make the indirect "
"light brighter (although it's better to tweak this from the light itself)."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Propagation** How much light propagates through the probe internally."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Bias** Value used to avoid self-occlusion when doing voxel cone tracing, "
"should generally be above 1.0 (1==voxel size)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Normal Bias** Alternative type of bias useful for some scenes. Experiment "
"with this one if regular bias does not work."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Interior** Allows mixing with lighting from the sky."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Compress** Currently broken. Do not use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Data** Contains the light baked data after baking. If you are saving the "
"data it should be saved as a .res file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Quality"
msgstr "Qualit√†"

msgid ""
"``GIProbe``\\ s are quite demanding. It is possible to use lower quality "
"voxel cone tracing in exchange for more performance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "Stato della traduzione"
