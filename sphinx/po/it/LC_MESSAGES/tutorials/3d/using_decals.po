"Decals are only supported in the Clustered Forward and Forward Mobile "
"rendering backends, not the Compatibility backend."

msgid ""
"If using the Compatibility backend, consider using Sprite3D as an "
"alternative for projecting decals onto (mostly) flat surfaces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decals are projected textures that apply on opaque or transparent surfaces "
"in 3D. This projection happens in real-time and doesn't rely on mesh "
"generation. This allows you to move decals every frame with only a small "
"performance impact, even when applied on complex meshes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While decals cannot add actual geometry detail onto the projected surface, "
"decals can still make use of physically-based rendering to provide similar "
"properties to full-blown :abbr:`PBR (Physically-Based Rendering)` materials."

msgid ""
"Sometimes, the fastest way to add texture detail to a scene is to use "
"decals. This is especially the case for organic detail, such as patches of "
"dirt or sand scattered on a large surface. Decals can help break up texture "
"repetition in scenes and make patterns look more natural. On a smaller "
"scale, decals can also be used to create detail variations for objects. For "
"example, decals can be used to add nuts and bolts on top of hard-surface "
"geometry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since decals can inject their own :abbr:`PBR (Physically-Based Rendering)` "
"properties on top of the projected surfaces, they can also be used to create "
"footprints or wet puddles."

msgid "Blob shadows"
msgstr "Ombre"

msgid ""
"Blob shadows are frequently used in mobile projects (or to follow a retro "
"art style), as real-time lighting tends to be too expensive on low-end "
"mobile devices. However, when relying on baked lightmaps with fully baked "
"lights, dynamic objects will not cast *any* shadow from those lights. This "
"makes dynamic objects in lightmapped scenes look flat in comparison to real-"
"time lighting, with dynamic objects almost looking like they're floating."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thanks to blob shadows, dynamic objects can still cast an approximative "
"shadow. Not only this helps with depth perception in the scene, but this can "
"also be a gameplay element, especially in 3D platformers. The blob shadow's "
"length can be extended to let the player know where they will land if they "
"fall straight down."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Even with real-time lighting, blob shadows can still be useful as a form of "
"ambient occlusion for situations where SSAO is too expensive or too unstable "
"due to its screen-space nature. For example, vehicles' underside shadows are "
"well-represented using blob shadows."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Move the Decal node towards an object, then rotate it so the decal is "
"visible (and in the right orientation). If the decal appears mirrored, try "
"to rotate it by 180 degrees. You can double-check whether it's in the right "
"orientation by increasing **Parameters > Normal Fade** to 0.5. This will "
"prevent the Decal from being projected on surfaces that are not facing the "
"decal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your decal is meant to affect static objects only, configure it to "
"prevent affecting dynamic objects (or vice versa). To do so, change the "
"decal's **Cull Mask** property to exclude certain layers. After doing this, "
"modify your dynamic objects' MeshInstance3D nodes to change their visibility "
"layers. For instance, you can move them from layer 1 to layer 2, then "
"disable layer 2 in the decal's **Cull Mask** property."

msgid ""
"**Albedo:** The albedo (diffuse/color) map to use for the decal. In most "
"situations, this is the texture you want to set first. If using a normal or "
"ORM map, an albedo map *must* be set to provide an alpha channel. This alpha "
"channel will be used as a mask to determine how much the normal/ORM maps "
"will affect the underlying surface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Normal:** The normal map to use for the decal. This can be used to "
"increase perceived detail on the decal by modifying how light reacts to it. "
"The impact of this texture is multiplied by the albedo texture's alpha "
"channel (but not **Albedo Mix**)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**ORM:** The Occlusion/Roughness/Metallic map to use for the decal. This is "
"an optimized format for storing PBR material maps. Ambient Occlusion map is "
"stored in the red channel, roughness map in the green channel, metallic map "
"in the blue channel. The impact of this texture is multiplied by the albedo "
"texture's alpha channel (but not **Albedo Mix**)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Emission:** The emission texture to use for the decal. Unlike **Albedo**, "
"this texture will appear to glow in the dark."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameters"
msgstr "Parametri"

msgid "**Emission Energy:** The brightness of the emission texture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Modulate:** Multiplies the color of the albedo and emission textures. Use "
"this to tint decals (e.g. for paint decals, or to increase variation by "
"randomizing each decal's modulation)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Albedo Mix:** The opacity of the albedo texture. Unlike using an albedo "
"texture with a more transparent alpha channel, decreasing this value below "
"``1.0`` does *not* reduce the impact of the normal/ORM texture on the "
"underlying surface. Set this to ``0.0`` when creating normal/ORM-only decals "
"such as footsteps or wet puddles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Normal Fade:** Fades the Decal if the angle between the Decal's :abbr:"
"`AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)` and the target surface becomes too large. "
"A value of ``0.0`` projects the decal regardless of angle, while a value of "
"``0.999`` limits the decal to surfaces that are nearly perpendicular. "
"Setting **Normal Fade** to a value greater than ``0.0`` has a small "
"performance cost due to the added normal angle computations."

"**Upper Fade:** The curve over which the decal will fade as the surface gets "
"further from the center of the :abbr:`AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)` "

"**Lower Fade:** The curve over which the decal will fade as the surface gets "

msgid "Distance Fade"
msgstr "Distanza"

msgid ""
"**Enabled:** Controls whether distance fade (a form of :abbr:`LOD (Level of "
"Detail)`) is enabled. The decal will fade out over **Begin + Length**, after "
"which it will be culled and not sent to the shader at all. Use this to "
"reduce the number of active decals in a scene and thus improve performance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Begin:** The distance from the camera at which the decal begins to fade "
"away (in 3D units)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Length:** The distance over which the decal fades (in 3D units). The decal "
"becomes slowly more transparent over this distance and is completely "
"invisible at the end. Higher values result in a smoother fade-out "
"transition, which is more suited when the camera moves fast."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Cull Mask"
msgstr "Maschera di Collisione"

msgid ""
"**Cull Mask:** Specifies which VisualInstance3D layers this decal will "
"project on. By default, decals affect all layers. This is used so you can "
"specify which types of objects receive the decal and which do not. This is "
"especially useful so you can ensure that dynamic objects don't accidentally "
"receive a Decal intended for the terrain under them."

msgid "Tweaking performance and quality"
msgstr "Prestazioni"

msgid ""
"Decal rendering performance is mostly determined by their screen coverage, "
"but also their number. In general, a few large decals that cover up most of "
"the screen will be more expensive to render than many small decals that are "
"scattered around."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To improve rendering performance, you can enable the **Distance Fade** "
"property as described above. This will make distant decals fade out when "
"they are far away from the camera (and may have little to no impact on the "
"final scene rendering). Using node groups, you can also prevent non-"
"essential decorative decals from spawning based on user configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The way decals are rendered also has an impact on performance. The "
"**Rendering > Textures > Decals > Filter** advanced project setting lets you "
"control how decal textures should be filtered. **Nearest/Linear** does not "
"use mipmaps. However, decals will look grainy at a distance. **Nearest/"
"Linear Mipmaps** will look smoother at a distance, but decals will look "
"blurry when viewed from oblique angles. This can be resolved by using "
"**Nearest/Linear Mipmaps Anisotropic**, which provides the highest quality "
"but is also slower to render."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your project has a pixel art style, consider setting the filter to one of "
"the **Nearest** values so that decals use nearest-neighbor filtering. "
"Otherwise, stick to **Linear**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limitations"
msgstr "Limitazioni"

msgid ""
"Decals cannot affect material properties other than the ones listed above, "
"such as height (for parallax mapping)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For performance reasons, decals use purely fixed rendering logic. This means "
"decals cannot use custom shaders. However, custom shaders on the projected "
"surfaces are able to read the information that is overridden by decals on "
"top of them, such as roughness and metallic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the Forward+ renderer, Godot uses a *clustering* approach for "
"decal rendering. As many decals as desired can be added (as long as "
"performance allows). However, there's still a default limit of 512 "
"*clustered elements* that can be present in the current camera view. A "
"clustered element is an omni light, a spot light, a :ref:`decal "
"<doc_using_decals>` or a :ref:`reflection probe <doc_reflection_probes>`. "
"This limit can be increased by adjusting the **Rendering > Limits > Cluster "
"Builder > Max Clustered Elements** advanced project setting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the Forward Mobile backend, only 8 decals can be applied on each "
"individual Mesh *resource*. If there are more decals affecting a single "
"mesh, not all of them will be rendered on the mesh."
