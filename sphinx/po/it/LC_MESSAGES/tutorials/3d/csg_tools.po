msgid "Prototyping levels with CSG"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CSG stands for **Constructive Solid Geometry**, and is a tool to combine "
"basic shapes or custom meshes to create more complex shapes. In 3D modelling "
"software, CSG is mostly known as \"Boolean Operators\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Level prototyping is one of the main uses of CSG in Godot. This technique "
"allows users to create simple versions of most common shapes by combining "
"primitives. Interior environments can be created by using inverted "
"primitives."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The CSG nodes in Godot are mainly intended for prototyping. There is no "
"built-in support for UV mapping or editing 3D polygons (though extruded 2D "
"polygons can be used with the CSGPolygon node)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're looking for an easy to use level design tool for a project, you "
"may want to use `Qodot <https://github.com/Shfty/qodot-plugin>`__ instead. "
"It lets you design levels using `TrenchBroom <https://kristianduske.com/"
"trenchbroom/>`__ and import them in Godot."

msgid "Introduction to CSG nodes"
msgstr "Introduzione ai nodi CSG"

"are the CSG nodes:"

msgid "Every CSG node supports 3 kinds of boolean operations:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Union:** Geometry of both primitives is merged, intersecting geometry is "
"removed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Intersection:** Only intersecting geometry remains, the rest is removed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Subtraction:** The second shape is subtracted from the first, leaving a "
"dent with its shape."
msgstr ""

msgid "CSGPolygon"
msgstr "CSGPolygon"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`CSGPolygon <class_CSGPolygon>` node extrude along a Polygon drawn "
"in 2D (in X, Y coordinates) in the following ways:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Depth:** Extruded back a given amount."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Spin:** Extruded while spinning around its origin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Path:** Extruded along a Path node. This operation is commonly called "
"lofting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **Path** mode must be provided with a :ref:`Path <class_Path>` node to "
"work. In the Path node, draw the path and the polygon in CSGPolygon will "
"extrude along the given path."
msgstr ""

msgid "Custom meshes"
msgstr "Mesh personalizzate"

msgid ""
"Any mesh can be used for :ref:`CSGMesh <class_CSGMesh>`; the mesh can be "
"modelled in other software and imported into Godot. Multiple materials are "
"supported. There are some restrictions for geometry:"
msgstr ""

msgid "it must be closed,"
msgstr ""

msgid "it must not self-intersect,"

msgid "it must not contain internal faces,"

msgstr ""

msgid "CSGCombiner"
msgstr "CSGCombiner"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`CSGCombiner <class_CSGCombiner>` node is an empty shape used for "
"organization. It will only combine children nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Processing order"
msgstr "Ordine di elaborazione"

msgid ""
"Every CSG node will first process its children nodes and their operations: "
"union, intersection or subtraction, in tree order, and apply them to itself "
"one after the other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the interest of performance, make sure CSG geometry remains relatively "
"simple, as complex meshes can take a while to process. If adding objects "
"together (such as table and room objects), create them as separate CSG "
"trees. Forcing too many objects in a single tree will eventually start "
"affecting performance. Only use binary operations where you actually need "
"them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Prototyping a level"
msgstr ""

msgid "We will prototype a room to practice the use of CSG tools."

"dimensions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adjust their placement to resemble a desk."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CSG nodes inside a CSGCombiner will only process their operation within the "
"combiner. Therefore, CSGCombiners are used to organize CSG nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a CSGCombiner and name it ``bed``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our bed consists of 3 parts: the bed, the mattress and a pillow. Create a "
"CSGBox and adjust its dimension for the bed. Create another CSGBox and "
"adjust its dimension for the mattress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We will create another CSGCombiner named ``pillow`` as the child of  "
"``bed``. The scene tree should look like this:"

"We will combine 3 CSGSphere nodes in **Union** mode to form a pillow. Scale "
"the Y axis of the spheres and enable **Smooth Faces**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select the ``pillow`` node and switch the mode to **Subtraction**; the "
"combined spheres will cut a hole into the mattress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Try to re-parent the ``pillow`` node to the root ``Spatial`` node; the hole "
"will disappear."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is to illustrate the effect of CSG processing order. Since the root "
"node is not a CSG node, the CSGCombiner nodes are the end of the operations; "
"this shows the use of CSGCombiner to organize the CSG scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Undo the re-parent after observing the effect. The bed you've built should "
"look like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a CSGCombiner and name it ``lamp``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A lamp consists of 3 parts: the stand, the pole and the lampshade. Create a "
"CSGCylinder, enable the **Cone** option and make it the stand. Create "
"another CSGCylinder and adjust the dimensions to use it as a pole."

msgid ""
"We will use a CSGPolygon for the lampshade. Use the **Spin** mode for the "
"CSGPolygon and draw a `trapezoid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid>`_ "

"mode to **Subtraction**."

"Position your furniture in your room as you like and your scene should look "

"You've successfully prototyped a room level with the CSG tools in Godot. CSG "
"tools can be used for designing all kinds of levels, such as a maze or a "
"city; explore its limitations when designing your game."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using prototype textures"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's :ref:`doc_spatial_material` supports *triplanar mapping*, which can "
"be used to automatically apply a texture to arbitrary objects without "
"distortion. This is handy when using CSG as Godot doesn't support editing UV "
"maps on CSG nodes yet. Triplanar mapping is relatively slow, which usually "
"restricts its usage to organic surfaces like terrain. Still, when "
"prototyping, it can be used to quickly apply textures to CSG-based levels."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need some textures for prototyping, Kenney made a `set of CC0-"
"licensed prototype textures <https://kenney.nl/assets/prototype-textures>`__."

msgid "There are two ways to apply a material to a CSG node:"
msgstr "Ci sono due modi per applicare un materiale a un nodo CSG:"

msgid ""
"Applying it to a CSGCombiner node as a material override (**Geometry > "
"Material Override** in the Inspector). This will affect its children "
"automatically, but will make it impossible to change the material in "
"individual children."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Applying a material to individual nodes (**Material** in the Inspector). "
"This way, each CSG node can have its own appearance. Subtractive CSG nodes "
"will apply their material to the nodes they're \"digging\" into."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To apply triplanar mapping to a CSG node, select it, go to the Inspector, "
"click the **[empty]** text next to **Material Override** (or **Material** "
"for individual CSG nodes). Choose **New SpatialMaterial**. Click the newly "
"created material's icon to edit it. Unfold the **Albedo** section and load a "
"texture into the **Texture** property. Now, unfold the **Uv1** section and "
"check **Triplanar**. You can change the texture offset and scale on each "
"axis by playing with the **Scale** and **Offset** properties just above. "
"Higher values in the **Scale** property will cause the texture to repeat "
"more often."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can copy a SpatialMaterial to reuse it across CSG nodes. To do so, click "
"the dropdown arrow next to a material property in the Inspector and choose "
"**Copy**. To paste it, select the node you'd like to apply the material "

"**Paste**."
