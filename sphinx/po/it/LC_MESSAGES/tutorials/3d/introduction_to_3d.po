"Creating a 3D game can be challenging. That extra Z coordinate makes many of "
"the common techniques that helped to make 2D games simple no longer work. To "
"aid in this transition, it is worth mentioning that Godot uses similar APIs "
"for 2D and 3D. Most nodes are the same and are present in both 2D and 3D "
"versions. In fact, it is worth checking the 3D platformer tutorial, or the "
"3D kinematic character tutorials, which are almost identical to their 2D "
"counterparts."
