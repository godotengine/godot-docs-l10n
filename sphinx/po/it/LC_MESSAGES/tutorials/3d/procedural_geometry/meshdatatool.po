msgid "Using the MeshDataTool"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ref:`MeshDataTool <class_meshdatatool>` is not used to generate "
"geometry. But it is helpful for dynamically altering geometry, for example "
"if you want to write a script to tessellate, simplify, or deform meshes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The MeshDataTool is not as fast as altering arrays directly using ArrayMesh. "
"However, it provides more information and tools to work with meshes than the "
"ArrayMesh does. When the MeshDataTool is used, it calculates mesh data that "
"is not available in ArrayMeshes such as faces and edges, which are necessary "
"for certain mesh algorithms. If you do not need this extra information then "
"it may be better to use an ArrayMesh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"MeshDataTool can only be used on Meshes that use the PrimitiveType ``Mesh."
"PRIMITIVE_TRIANGLES``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We initialize the MeshDataTool from an ArrayMesh by calling "
"``create_from_surface()``. If there is already data initialized in the "
"MeshDataTool, calling ``create_from_surface()`` will clear it for you. "
"Alternatively, you can call ``clear()`` yourself before re-using the "
"MeshDataTool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the examples below, assume an ArrayMesh called ``mesh`` has already been "
"created. See :ref:`ArrayMesh tutorial <doc_arraymesh>` for an example of "
"mesh generation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``create_from_surface()`` uses the vertex arrays from the ArrayMesh to "
"calculate two additional arrays, one for edges and one for faces, for a "
"total of three arrays."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An edge is a connection between any two vertices. Each edge in the edge "
"array contains a reference to the two vertices it is composed of, and up to "
"two faces that it is contained within."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A face is a triangle made up of three vertices and three corresponding "
"edges. Each face in the face array contains a reference to the three "
"vertices and three edges it is composed of."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The vertex array contains edge, face, normal, color, tangent, uv, uv2, bone, "
"and weight information connected with each vertex."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To access information from these arrays you use a function of the form "
"``get_****()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What you choose to do with these functions is up to you. A common use case "
"is to iterate over all vertices and transform them in some way:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These modifications are not done in place on the ArrayMesh. If you are "
"dynamically updating an existing ArrayMesh, first delete the existing "
"surface before adding a new one using :ref:`commit_to_surface() "
"<class_meshdatatool_method_commit_to_surface>`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Below is a complete example that turns a spherical mesh called ``mesh`` into "
"a randomly deformed blob complete with updated normals and vertex colors. "
"See :ref:`ArrayMesh tutorial <doc_arraymesh>` for how to generate the base "
"mesh."
