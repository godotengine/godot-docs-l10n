"The problem with :ref:`MeshInstances <class_MeshInstance>` is that it is "
"expensive to update their transform array. It is great for placing many "
"static objects around the scene. But it is still difficult to move the "
"objects around the scene."

"To make each instance move in an interesting way, we will use a :ref:"
"`Particles <class_Particles>` node. Particles take advantage of GPU "
"acceleration by computing and setting the per-instance information in a :ref:"
"`Shader <class_Shader>`."

"Particles are not available in GLES2, instead use :ref:`CPUParticles "

"First create a Particles node. Then, under \"Draw Passes\" set the "

"A unique thing about particle shaders is that some built-in variables are "
"saved across frames. ``TRANSFORM``, ``COLOR``, and ``CUSTOM`` can all be "
"accessed in the Spatial shader of the mesh, and also in the particle shader "
"the next time it is run."

"First we will distinguish between code that needs to be run only when the "
"particle system starts and code that should always run. We want to give each "
"fish a random position and a random animation offset when the system is "
"first run. To do so, we wrap that code in an ``if`` statement that checks "
"the built-in variable ``RESTART`` which becomes ``true`` for one frame when "
"the particle system is restarted."
