"Godot offers a first-party ``GodotGooglePlayBilling`` Android plugin since "
"Godot 3.2.2. The new plugin uses the `Google Play Billing library <https://"
"developer.android.com/google/play/billing>`__ instead of the now deprecated "
"AIDL IAP implementation."

"If not already done, make sure you have enabled and successfully set up :ref:"

"To initiate the purchase flow for an item, call ``purchase``. You **must** "

msgid ""
"To get all purchases, call ``queryPurchases``. Unlike most of the other "
"functions, ``queryPurchases`` is a synchronous operation and returns a :ref:"
"`Dictionary <class_Dictionary>` with a status code and either an array of "
"purchases or an error message. Only active subscriptions and non-consumed "
"one-time purchases are returned."

"If your in-app item is not a one-time purchase but a consumable item (e.g. "
"coins) which can be purchased multiple times, you can consume an item by "
"calling ``consumePurchase`` with a purchase token. Call ``queryPurchases`` "
"to get the purchase token. Calling ``consumePurchase`` automatically "
"acknowledges a purchase. Consuming a product allows the user to purchase it "
"again, and removes it from appearing in subsequent ``queryPurchases`` calls."

msgid "Subscriptions"

msgid ""
"Subscriptions don't work much different from regular in-app items. Just use "
"``\"subs\"`` as second argument to ``querySkuDetails`` to get subscription "
"details. Check ``is_auto_renewing`` in the results of ``queryPurchases()`` "
"to see if a user has cancelled an auto-renewing subscription"
