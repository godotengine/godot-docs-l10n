msgid "Supporting universal input"
msgstr "Importazione di traduzioni"

msgid ""
"Thanks to Godot's input action system, Godot makes it possible to support "
"both keyboard and controller input without having to write separate code "
"paths. Instead of hardcoding keys or controller buttons in your scripts, you "
"should create *input actions* in the Project Settings which will then refer "
"to specified key and controller inputs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Input actions are explained in detail on the :ref:`doc_inputevent` page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike keyboard input, supporting both mouse and controller input for an "
"action (such as looking around in a first-person game) will require "
"different code paths since these have to be handled separately."

msgid "There are 3 ways to get input in an analog-aware way:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you have two axes (such as joystick or WASD movement) and want both "
"axes to behave as a single input, use ``Input.get_vector()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you have one axis that can go both ways (such as a throttle on a flight "
"stick), or when you want to handle separate axes individually, use ``Input."
"get_axis()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For other types of analog input, such as handling a trigger or handling one "
"direction at a time, use ``Input.get_action_strength()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For non-analog digital/boolean input (only \"pressed\" or \"not pressed\" "
"values), such as controller buttons, mouse buttons or keyboard keys, use "
"``Input.is_action_pressed()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot versions before 3.4, such as 3.3, ``Input.get_vector()`` and "
"``Input.get_axis()`` aren't available. Only ``Input.get_action_strength()`` "
"and ``Input.is_action_pressed()`` are available in Godot 3.3."

msgid "Dead zone"
msgstr "Zona morta"

msgid ""
"Unlike keyboards and mice, controllers offer axes with *analog* inputs. The "
"upside of analog inputs is that they offer additional flexibility for "
"actions. Unlike digital inputs which can only provide strengths of ``0.0`` "
"and ``1.0``, an analog input can provide *any* strength between ``0.0`` and "
"``1.0``. The downside is that without a deadzone system, an analog axis' "
"strength will never be equal to ``0.0`` due to how the controller is "
"physically built. Instead, it will linger at a low value such as ``0.062``. "
"This phenomenon is known as *drifting* and can be more noticeable on old or "
"faulty controllers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's take a racing game as a real-world example. Thanks to analog inputs, "
"we can steer the car slowly in one direction or another. However, without a "
"deadzone system, the car would slowly steer by itself even if the player "
"isn't touching the joystick. This is because the directional axis strength "
"won't be equal to ``0.0`` when we expect it to. Since we don't want our car "
"to steer by itself in this case, we define a \"dead zone\" value of ``0.2`` "
"which will ignore all input whose strength is lower than ``0.2``. An ideal "
"dead zone value is high enough to ignore the input caused by joystick "
"drifting, but is low enough to not ignore actual input from the player."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot features a built-in dead zone system to tackle this problem. The "
"default value is ``0.2``, but you can increase it or decrease it on a per-"
"action basis in the Project Settings' Input Map tab. For ``Input."
"get_vector()``, the deadzone can be specified, or otherwise it will "
"calculate the average deadzone value from all of the actions in the vector."

msgid "\"Echo\" events"
msgstr "Eventi \"Echo\""

msgid ""
"Unlike keyboard input, holding down a controller button such as a D-pad "
"direction will **not** generate repeated input events at fixed intervals "
"(also known as \"echo\" events). This is because the operating system never "
"sends \"echo\" events for controller input in the first place."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want controller buttons to send echo events, you will have to "
"generate :ref:`class_InputEvent` objects by code and parse them using :ref:"
"`Input.parse_input_event() <class_Input_method_parse_input_event>` at "
"regular intervals. This can be accomplished with the help of a :ref:"
"`class_Timer` node."

"confirm that your controller is recognized."
msgstr ""

msgid "My controller has incorrectly mapped buttons or axes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If buttons are incorrectly mapped, this may be due to an erroneous mapping "
"from the `SDL game controller database <https://github.com/gabomdq/"

"included in the next Godot version by opening a pull request on the linked "
"repository."

"There are many ways to create mappings. One option is to use the mapping "
"wizard in the `official Joypads demo <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/"

"test it by defining the ``SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG`` environment variable "
"before running Godot:"

"To test mappings on non-desktop platforms or to distribute your project with "

"Prior to Godot 3.3, official Godot binaries were compiled with udev support "

"HTML5 controller support is often less reliable compared to \"native\" "

"different browser if they can't get their controller to work."
