"In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Godot's :ref:`InputEvent "
"<class_InputEvent>` system to capture player input. There are many different "
"types of input your game may use - keyboard, gamepad, mouse, etc. - and many "
"different ways to turn those inputs into actions in your game. This document "
"will show you some of the most common scenarios, which you can use as "
"starting points for your own projects."

msgid "Events versus polling"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes you want your game to respond to a certain input event - pressing "
"the \"jump\" button, for example. For other situations, you might want "
"something to happen as long as a key is pressed, such as movement. In the "
"first case, you can use the ``_input()`` function, which will be called "
"whenever an input event occurs. In the second case, Godot provides the :ref:"
"`Input <class_Input>` singleton, which you can use to query the state of an "
"input."

msgstr "Eventi di ingresso"

msgid ""
"Input events are objects that inherit from :ref:`InputEvent "
"<class_InputEvent>`. Depending on the event type, the object will contain "
"specific properties related to that event. To see what events actually look "
"like, add a Node and attach the following script:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you press keys, move the mouse, and perform other inputs, you'll see each "
"event scroll by in the output window. Here's an example of the output:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see, the results are very different for the different types of "
"input. Key events are even printed as their key symbols. For example, let's "
"consider :ref:`InputEventMouseButton <class_InputEventMouseButton>`. It "
"inherits from the following classes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`InputEvent <class_InputEvent>` - the base class for all input events"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`InputEventWithModifiers <class_InputEventWithModifiers>` - adds the "
"ability to check if modifiers are pressed, such as :kbd:`Shift` or :kbd:"
"`Alt`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`InputEventMouse <class_InputEventMouse>` - adds mouse event "
"properties, such as ``position``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`InputEventMouseButton <class_InputEventMouseButton>` - contains the "
"index of the button that was pressed, whether it was a double-click, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's a good idea to keep the class reference open while you're working with "
"events so you can check the event type's available properties and methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can encounter errors if you try to access a property on an input type "
"that doesn't contain it - calling ``position`` on ``InputEventKey`` for "
"example. To avoid this, make sure to test the event type first:"
msgstr ""

msgid "InputMap"
msgstr "InputMap"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`InputMap <class_InputMap>` is the most flexible way to handle a "
"variety of inputs. You use this by creating named input *actions*, to which "
"you can assign any number of input events, such as keypresses or mouse "
"clicks. To see them, and to add your own, open Project -> Project Settings "
"and select the InputMap tab:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A new Godot project includes a number of default actions already defined. To "
"see them, turn on ``Show Built-in Actions`` in the InputMap dialog."

msgid "Capturing actions"
msgstr "Catturare le azioni"

msgid ""
"Once you've defined your actions, you can process them in your scripts using "
"``is_action_pressed()`` and ``is_action_released()`` by passing the name of "
"the action you're looking for:"

msgid "Keyboard events"
msgstr "Eventi Keyboard"

msgid ""
"Keyboard events are captured in :ref:`InputEventKey <class_InputEventKey>`. "
"While it's recommended to use input actions instead, there may be cases "
"where you want to specifically look at key events. For this example, let's "
"check for the :kbd:`T`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See :ref:`@GlobalScope_Key <enum_@GlobalScope_Key>` for a list of keycode "
"constants."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to *keyboard ghosting*, not all key inputs may be registered at a given "
"time if you press too many keys at once. Due to their location on the "
"keyboard, certain keys are more prone to ghosting than others. Some "
"keyboards feature antighosting at a hardware level, but this feature is "
"generally not present on low-end keyboards and laptop keyboards."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, it's recommended to use a default keyboard layout that is "
"designed to work well on a keyboard without antighosting. See `this Gamedev "
"Stack Exchange question <https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/109002>`__ for "
"more information."

msgid "Keyboard modifiers"
msgstr "Modificatori Keyboard"

msgid ""
"Modifier properties are inherited from :ref:`InputEventWithModifiers "
"<class_InputEventWithModifiers>`. This allows you to check for modifier "
"combinations using boolean properties. Let's imagine you want one thing to "
"happen when the :kbd:`T` is pressed, but something different when it's :kbd:"
"`Shift + T`:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Mouse events"
msgstr "Eventi Mouse"

msgid ""
"Mouse events stem from the :ref:`InputEventMouse <class_InputEventMouse>` "
"class, and are separated into two types: :ref:`InputEventMouseButton "
"<class_InputEventMouseButton>` and :ref:`InputEventMouseMotion "
"<class_InputEventMouseMotion>`. Note that this means that all mouse events "
"will contain a ``position`` property."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Mouse buttons"
msgstr "Bottoni Mouse"

msgid ""
"Capturing mouse buttons is very similar to handling key events. :ref:"
"`@GlobalScope_MouseButton <enum_@GlobalScope_MouseButton>` contains a list "
"of ``MOUSE_BUTTON_*`` constants for each possible button, which will be "
"reported in the event's ``button_index`` property. Note that the scrollwheel "
"also counts as a button - two buttons, to be precise, with both "
"``MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_UP`` and ``MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN`` being separate "
"events."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Mouse motion"
msgstr "Movimento Mouse"

msgid ""
":ref:`InputEventMouseMotion <class_InputEventMouseMotion>` events occur "
"whenever the mouse moves. You can find the move's distance with the "
"``relative`` property."
msgstr ""

"Here's an example using mouse events to drag-and-drop a :ref:`Sprite2D "
"<class_Sprite2D>` node:"

msgid "Touch events"
msgstr "Eventi Touch"

msgid ""
"If you are using a touchscreen device, you can generate touch events. :ref:"
"`InputEventScreenTouch <class_InputEventScreenTouch>` is equivalent to a "
"mouse click event, and :ref:`InputEventScreenDrag "
"<class_InputEventScreenDrag>` works much the same as mouse motion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To test your touch events on a non-touchscreen device, open Project Settings "
"and go to the \"Input Devices/Pointing\" section. Enable \"Emulate Touch "
"From Mouse\" and your project will interpret mouse clicks and motion as "
"touch events."
