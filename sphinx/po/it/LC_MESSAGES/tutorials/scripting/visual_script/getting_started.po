msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As with everything in Godot, we prioritize a good experience over copying or "
"integrating third party solutions which might not fit nicely in the current "
"workflow. This led us to write our own version of how we believe this "
"feature would work best with the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot, a Visual Script fits smoothly together with regular scripts in the "
"Editor tab"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In fact, Visual Scripting integrates so well to Godot that it's hard to "
"believe it was added only in version 3.0. This is because, when editing, the "
"rest of Godot panels and docks act like a palette from where you can drag "
"and drop all sorts of information to the script canvas:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a script"
msgstr "Creare uno script"

msgid ""
"Creating scripts works the same as with other scripting languages: Select "
"any node in the scene and push the \"New Script\" button at the top right "
"corner of the Scene Tree dock:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once it opens, the script type \"Visual Script\" must be selected from the "
"drop down list. The script extension must be \".vs\" (for Visual Script!)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, the Script Editor will open, allowing you to start editing the "
"visual script:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding a function"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike other visual scripting implementations, Visual Scripting in Godot is "
"heavily based on functions. This happens because it uses the same interface "
"to communicate with the engine as other scripting engines. In Godot, the "
"scripting interface is universal and all implementations conform to it."
msgstr ""

msgid "A function is an individual canvas with nodes connected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A single script can contain many functions, each of which will have a canvas "
"of its own, allowing for more organization."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are three main ways to add functions in a script:"
msgstr "Ci sono tre modi principali per aggiungere funzioni in uno script:"

#, fuzzy
msgid "Overriding a virtual function"
msgstr "Sovrascrivere una funzione virtuale"

msgid ""
"Most types of nodes and other types of objects in Godot contain virtual "
"functions. These are functions that will be called (run your code) when "
"something happens and can be looked up in the reference. Virtual functions "
"are listed when pressing the \"Override\" icon in the member panel:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the following example, a function will be executed when the node is "
"loaded and added to the running scene. For this, the _ready() virtual method "
"will be overridden:"
msgstr ""
"Nell'esempio seguente, una funzione sarà eseguita quando il nodo è caricato "
"e aggiunto alla scena in esecuzione. Per questo, il metodo virtuale _ready() "
"sarà sovrascritto:"

msgid "Finally, a canvas appears for this function, showing the override:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"As some functions expect you to return a value, they will also add a return "
"node where such value is supposed to be provided:"
msgstr ""
"Poiché alcune funzioni si aspettano che tu restituisca un valore, "
"aggiungeranno anche un nodo di ritorno in cui dovrebbe essere fornito tale "
"valore:"

#, fuzzy
msgid "Connecting a signal to a function"
msgstr "Collegare un segnale a una funzione"

msgid ""
"Nodes in a tree emit signals when something happens. Godot uses signals for "
"all sorts of things. A typical example would be a button that emits a "
"\"pressed\" signal when actually pressed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For this, a node must be selected and the Node tab opened. This will allow "
"inspecting the signals. Once they are displayed, connect the \"pressed\" "
"signal:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will open the connection dialog. In this dialog, you must select the "
"node where the signal will be connected to, and the function that will "
"receive the signal:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this is done right, a new function will be created in our script and a "
"signal will automatically be connected to it:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a function manually"
msgstr "Creare una funzione manualmente"

msgid ""
"The last way to create functions is to do it manually. In general, this is "
"not as common unless you really need it. Custom functions work when another "
"(or the same) script calls them manually. The main use cases for this are "
"breaking a larger function up into several manageable chunks and reusing "
"your visual code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a function manually, push the big \"Plus\" button, and a new "
"function will be added with a default name:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will add a new function, which can be renamed by simply double clicking "
"its name:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To edit the \"arguments\" this function can get (the values you pass to it "
"when you call this function), simply click the Function node and check the "
"inspector:"
msgstr ""

msgid "More on that will be explained later in this document."
msgstr ""

msgstr "Stato della traduzione"
