msgid "Change scenes manually"
msgstr "Cambiare le scene manualmente"

msgid ""
"Sometimes it helps to have more control over how one swaps scenes around. As "
"mentioned above, a :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`'s child nodes will "
"render to the image it generates. This holds true even for nodes outside of "
"the \"current\" scene. Autoloads fall into this category, but so do scenes "
"which one instances and adds to the tree at runtime:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To complete the cycle and swap out the new scene with the old one, "
"developers have a choice to make. Many strategies exist for removing a scene "
"from view of the :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`. The tradeoffs involve "
"balancing operation speed and memory consumption as well as balancing data "
"access and integrity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**We can delete the existing scene.** :ref:`SceneTree.change_scene_to_file() "
"<class_SceneTree_method_change_scene_to_file>` and :ref:`SceneTree."
"change_scene_to_packed() <class_SceneTree_method_change_scene_to_packed>` "
"will delete the current scene immediately. Developers can also delete the "
"main scene though. Assuming the root node's name is \"Main\", one could do "
"``get_node(\"/root/Main\").free()`` to delete the whole scene."

msgid "Unloads memory."
msgstr "Scarica la memoria."

msgid "Pro: RAM is no longer dragging the dead weight."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Con: Returning to that scene is now more expensive since it must be loaded "
"back into memory again (takes time AND memory). Not a problem if returning "
"soon is unnecessary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Con: No longer have access to that scene's data. Not a problem if using that "
"data soon is unnecessary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note: It can be useful to preserve the data in a soon-to-be-deleted scene by "
"re-attaching one or more of its nodes to a different scene, or even directly "
"to the :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>`."

msgid "Processing stops."
msgstr "L'elaborazione si ferma."

msgid ""
"Pro: No nodes means no process, physics process, or input handling. The CPU "
"is available to work on the new scene's contents."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Con: Those nodes' processing and input handling no longer operate. Not a "
"problem if using the updated data is unnecessary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**We can hide the existing scene.** By changing the visibility or collision "
"detection of the nodes, we can hide the entire node sub-tree from the "
"player's perspective."
msgstr ""

msgid "Memory still exists."
msgstr "La memoria esiste ancora."

msgid "Pro: One can still access the data if need be."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pro: There's no need to move any more nodes around to save data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Con: More data is being kept in memory which will be become a problem on "
"memory-sensitive platforms like web or mobile."
msgstr ""

msgid "Processing continues."
msgstr "L'elaborazione continua."

msgid ""
"Pro: Data continues to receive processing updates, so the scene will keep "
"updated any data within it that relies on delta time or frame data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pro: Nodes are still members of groups (since groups belong to the :ref:"
"`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Con: The CPU's attention is now divided between both scenes. Too much load "
"could result in low frame rates. One should be sure to test performance as "
"they go to ensure the target platform can support the load they are giving "
"it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**We can remove the existing scene from the tree.** Assign a variable to the "
"existing scene's root node. Then use :ref:`Node.remove_child(Node) "
"<class_Node_method_remove_child>` to detach the entire scene from the tree."
msgstr ""

msgid "Memory still exists (similar pros/cons as with hiding it from view)."
msgstr ""
"La memoria esiste ancora (pro/contro simili a nasconderla dalla vista)."

msgid "Processing stops (similar pros/cons as with deleting it completely)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pro: This variation of \"hiding\" it is much easier to show/hide. Rather "
"than potentially keeping track of multiple changes to the scene, one must "
"only call the one method add/remove_child pair of methods. It is similar to "
"disabling game objects in other engines."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Con: Unlike with hiding it from view only, the data contained within the "
"scene will become stale if it relies on delta time, input, groups, or other "
"data that is derived from :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` access."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are also cases where one may wish to have many scenes present at the "
"same time. Perhaps one is adding their own singleton at runtime, or "
"preserving a a scene's data between scene changes (adding the scene to the "
"root node)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Perhaps instead they wish to display multiple scenes at the same time using :"
"ref:`SubViewportContainers <class_SubViewportContainer>`. This is optimal in "
"cases where the intent is to render different content in different parts of "
"the screen. Minimaps and split-screen multiplayer are good examples."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each option will have cases where it is best appropriate, so one must "
"examine the effects of each and determine what path best fits their unique "
"situation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "Stato della traduzione"
