"A file system manages how assets are stored and how they are accessed. A "
"well-designed file system also allows multiple developers to edit the same "
"source files and assets while collaborating. Godot stores all assets as "
"files in its file system."
msgstr ""
"Un file system gestisce come le risorse sono memorizzate e come vi si "
"accede. Un file system ben progettato permette anche a più sviluppatori di "
"modificare gli stessi file sorgente e le risorse mentre si collabora. Godot "
"memorizza tutte le risorse come file nel suo file system."

msgid ""
"The file system stores resources on disk. Anything, from a script, to a "
"scene or a PNG image is a resource to the engine. If a resource contains "
"properties that reference other resources on disk, the paths to those "
"resources are also included. If a resource has sub-resources that are built-"
"in, the resource is saved in a single file together with all the bundled sub-"
"resources. For example, a font resource is often bundled together with the "
"font textures."

"The Godot file system avoids using metadata files. Existing asset managers "
"and VCSs are better than anything we can implement, so Godot tries its best "
"to play along with SVN, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, etc."
msgstr ""
"Il file system di Godot evita di usare file di metadati. I gestori di "
"risorse e VCS esistenti sono migliori di qualsiasi cosa possiamo "
"implementare, quindi Godot fa del suo meglio per giocare con SVN, Git, "
"Mercurial, Perforce, ecc."

msgid "Example of file system contents:"
msgstr "Esempio di contenuto del file system:"

msgid "project.godot"
msgstr "project.godot"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The ``project.godot`` file is the project description file, and it is always "
"found at the root of the project. In fact, its location defines where the "
"root is. This is the first file that Godot looks for when opening a project."
msgstr ""
"Il file ``project.godot`` è il file di descrizione del progetto, e si trova "
"sempre alla radice del progetto. Infatti, la sua posizione definisce dove si "
"trova la radice. Questo è il primo file che Godot cerca quando apre un "
"progetto."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"This file contains the project configuration in plain text, using the win."
"ini format. Even an empty ``project.godot`` can function as a basic "
"definition of a blank project."
msgstr ""
"Questo file contiene la configurazione del progetto in testo semplice, "
"usando il formato win.ini. Anche un ``progetto.godot`` vuoto può funzionare "
"come definizione di base di un progetto vuoto."

#, fuzzy
msgid "Path delimiter"
msgstr "Delimitatore di percorso"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Godot only supports ``/`` as a path delimiter. This is done for portability "
"reasons. All operating systems support this, even Windows, so a path such as "
"``C:\\project\\project.godot`` needs to be typed as ``C:/project/project."
"godot``."
msgstr ""
"Godot supporta solo ``/`` come delimitatore di percorso. Questo è fatto per "
"ragioni di portabilità. Tutti i sistemi operativi lo supportano, anche "
"Windows, quindi un percorso come ``C:\\project\\project.godot`` deve essere "
"digitato come ``C:/project/project.godot``."

#, fuzzy
msgid "Resource path"
msgstr "Percorso delle risorse"

msgid ""
"When accessing resources, using the host OS file system layout can be "
"cumbersome and non-portable. To solve this problem, the special path ``res://"
"`` was created."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The path ``res://`` will always point at the project root (where ``project."
"godot`` is located, so ``res://project.godot`` is always valid)."
msgstr ""
"Il percorso ``res://`` punterà sempre alla radice del progetto (dove si "
"trova ``project.godot``, quindi ``res://project.godot`` è sempre valido)."

msgid ""
"This file system is read-write only when running the project locally from "
"the editor. When exported or when running on different devices (such as "
"phones or consoles, or running from DVD), the file system will become read-"
"only and writing will no longer be permitted."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "User path"
msgstr "Percorso utente"

msgid ""
"Writing to disk is still needed for tasks such as saving game state or "
"downloading content packs. To this end, the engine ensures that there is a "
"special path ``user://`` that is always writable. This path resolves "
"differently depending on the OS the project is running on. Local path "
"resolution is further explained in :ref:`doc_data_paths`."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Host file system"
msgstr "File system host"

msgid ""
"Alternatively host file system paths can also be used, but this is not "
"recommended for a released product as these paths are not guaranteed to work "
"on all platforms. However, using host file system paths can be useful when "
"writing development tools in Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid "Drawbacks"
msgstr "Svantaggi"

msgid ""
"There are some drawbacks to this simple file system design. The first issue "
"is that moving assets around (renaming them or moving them from one path to "
"another inside the project) will break existing references to these assets. "
"These references will have to be re-defined to point at the new asset "
"location."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid this, do all your move, delete and rename operations from within "
"Godot, on the FileSystem dock. Never move assets from outside Godot, or "
"dependencies will have to be fixed manually (Godot detects this and helps "
"you fix them anyway, but why go the hard route?)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second is that, under Windows and macOS, file and path names are case "
"insensitive. If a developer working in a case insensitive host file system "
"saves an asset as ``myfile.PNG``, but then references it as ``myfile.png``, "
"it will work fine on their platform, but not on other platforms, such as "
"Linux, Android, etc. This may also apply to exported binaries, which use a "
"compressed package to store all files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is recommended that your team clearly define a naming convention for "
"files when working with Godot. One simple fool-proof convention is to only "
"allow lowercase file and path names."
