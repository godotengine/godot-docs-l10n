msgid "GDScript style guide"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This style guide lists conventions to write elegant GDScript. The goal is to "
"encourage writing clean, readable code and promote consistency across "
"projects, discussions, and tutorials. Hopefully, this will also support the "
"development of auto-formatting tools."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since GDScript is close to Python, this guide is inspired by Python's `PEP 8 "
"<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ programming style guide."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Style guides aren't meant as hard rulebooks. At times, you may not be able "
"to apply some of the guidelines below. When that happens, use your best "
"judgment, and ask fellow developers for insights."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, keeping your code consistent in your projects and within your "
"team is more important than following this guide to a tee."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's built-in script editor uses a lot of these conventions by default. "
"Let it help you."
msgstr ""
"L'editor di script integrato di Godot utilizza molte di queste convenzioni "
"come impostazione predefinita. Lascia che ti aiuti."

msgid "Encoding and special characters"
msgstr "Rapporti d'aspetto di manipolazione"

msgid ""
"Use line feed (**LF**) characters to break lines, not CRLF or CR. *(editor "
"default)*"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use one line feed character at the end of each file. *(editor default)*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use **UTF-8** encoding without a `byte order mark <https://en.wikipedia.org/"
"wiki/Byte_order_mark>`_. *(editor default)*"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use **Tabs** instead of spaces for indentation. *(editor default)*"
msgstr ""

msgid "Indentation"
msgstr "Indentazione"

#, fuzzy
msgid "Each indent level should be one greater than the block containing it."
msgstr ""
"Ogni livello di indentazione dovrebbe essere una volta più grande del blocco "
"che lo contiene."

msgid "**Good**:"
msgstr "**Bene**:"

msgid "**Bad**:"
msgstr "**Male**:"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Use 2 indent levels to distinguish continuation lines from regular code "
"blocks."
msgstr ""
"Usate 2 livelli di rientro per distinguere le linee di continuazione dai "
"normali blocchi di codice."

msgid ""
"Exceptions to this rule are arrays, dictionaries, and enums. Use a single "
"indentation level to distinguish continuation lines:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Trailing comma"
msgstr "Virgola finale"

msgid ""
"Use a trailing comma on the last line in arrays, dictionaries, and enums. "
"This results in easier refactoring and better diffs in version control as "
"the last line doesn't need to be modified when adding new elements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Trailing commas are unnecessary in single-line lists, so don't add them in "
"this case."
msgstr ""

msgid "Blank lines"
msgstr "Righe vuote"

msgid "Surround functions and class definitions with two blank lines:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Use one blank line inside functions to separate logical sections."
msgstr ""
"Usate una riga vuota all'interno delle funzioni per separare le sezioni "
"logiche."

msgid ""
"We use a single line between classes and function definitions in the class "
"reference and in short code snippets in this documentation."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Line length"
msgstr "Lunghezza della linea"

msgid "Keep individual lines of code under 100 characters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you can, try to keep lines under 80 characters. This helps to read the "
"code on small displays and with two scripts opened side-by-side in an "
"external text editor. For example, when looking at a differential revision."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "One statement per line"
msgstr "Un'istruzione per riga"

msgid ""
"Never combine multiple statements on a single line. No, C programmers, not "
"even with a single line conditional statement."
msgstr ""

msgid "The only exception to that rule is the ternary operator:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Format multiline statements for readability"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you have particularly long ``if`` statements or nested ternary "
"expressions, wrapping them over multiple lines improves readability. Since "
"continuation lines are still part of the same expression, 2 indent levels "
"should be used instead of one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDScript allows wrapping statements using multiple lines using parentheses "
"or backslashes. Parentheses are favored in this style guide since they make "
"for easier refactoring. With backslashes, you have to ensure that the last "
"line never contains a backslash at the end. With parentheses, you don't have "
"to worry about the last line having a backslash at the end."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When wrapping a conditional expression over multiple lines, the ``and``/"
"``or`` keywords should be placed at the beginning of the line continuation, "
"not at the end of the previous line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Avoid unnecessary parentheses"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Avoid parentheses in expressions and conditional statements. Unless "
"necessary for order of operations or wrapping over multiple lines, they only "
"reduce readability."
msgstr ""
"Evitare le parentesi nelle espressioni e nelle dichiarazioni condizionali. A "
"meno che non siano necessarie per l'ordine delle operazioni, riducono solo "
"la leggibilità."

msgid "Boolean operators"
msgstr "Operatori booleani"

msgid ""
"Prefer the plain English versions of boolean operators, as they are the most "
"accessible:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use ``and`` instead of ``&&``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use ``or`` instead of ``||``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use ``not`` instead of ``!``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may also use parentheses around boolean operators to clear any "
"ambiguity. This can make long expressions easier to read."
msgstr ""

msgid "Comment spacing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regular comments (``#``) and documentation comments (``##``) should start "
"with a space, but not code that you comment out. Additionally, code region "
"comments (``#region``/``#endregion``) must follow that precise syntax, so "
"they should not start with a space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using a space for regular and documentation comments helps differentiate "
"text comments from disabled code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the script editor, to toggle commenting of the selected code, press :kbd:"
"`Ctrl + K`. This feature adds/removes a single ``#`` sign before any code on "
"the selected lines."
msgstr ""

msgid "Whitespace"
msgstr "Spazio bianco"

msgid ""
"Always use one space around operators and after commas. Also, avoid extra "
"spaces in dictionary references and function calls."
msgstr ""

msgid "Don't use spaces to align expressions vertically:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Quotes"
msgstr "Virgolette"

msgid ""
"Use double quotes unless single quotes make it possible to escape fewer "
"characters in a given string. See the examples below:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Numbers"
msgstr "Numeri"

msgid ""
"Don't omit the leading or trailing zero in floating-point numbers. "
"Otherwise, this makes them less readable and harder to distinguish from "
"integers at a glance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use lowercase for letters in hexadecimal numbers, as their lower height "
"makes the number easier to read."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Take advantage of GDScript's underscores in literals to make large numbers "
"more readable."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Naming conventions"
msgstr "Convenzioni di denominazione"

msgid ""
"These naming conventions follow the Godot Engine style. Breaking these will "
"make your code clash with the built-in naming conventions, leading to "
"inconsistent code."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "File names"
msgstr "File generati"

msgid ""
"Use snake_case for file names. For named classes, convert the PascalCase "
"class name to snake_case::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is consistent with how C++ files are named in Godot's source code. This "
"also avoids case sensitivity issues that can crop up when exporting a "
"project from Windows to other platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid "Classes and nodes"
msgstr "Classi e nodi"

msgid "Use PascalCase for class and node names:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Also use PascalCase when loading a class into a constant or a variable:"

msgid "Functions and variables"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use snake\\_case to name functions and variables:"

#, fuzzy
msgid "Code order"
msgstr "Ordine del codice"

msgid ""
"This first section focuses on code order. For formatting, see :ref:"
"`formatting`. For naming conventions, see :ref:`naming_conventions`."
msgstr ""

msgid "We suggest to organize GDScript code this way:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We optimized the order to make it easy to read the code from top to bottom, "
"to help developers reading the code for the first time understand how it "
"works, and to avoid errors linked to the order of variable declarations."
msgstr ""

msgid "This code order follows four rules of thumb:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Properties and signals come first, followed by methods."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Public comes before private."
msgstr "Public viene prima di private."

msgid "Virtual callbacks come before the class's interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object's construction and initialization functions, ``_init`` and "
"``_ready``, come before functions that modify the object at runtime."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Class declaration"
msgstr "Dichiarazione di classe"

msgid ""
"If the code is meant to run in the editor, place the ``@tool`` annotation on "
"the first line of the script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Follow with the ``class_name`` if necessary. You can turn a GDScript file "
"into a global type in your project using this feature. For more information, "
"see :ref:`doc_gdscript`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then, add the ``extends`` keyword if the class extends a built-in type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Following that, you should have the class's optional :ref:`documentation "
"comments <doc_gdscript_documentation_comments>`. You can use that to explain "
"the role of your class to your teammates, how it works, and how other "
"developers should use it, for example."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Signals and properties"
msgstr "Proprietà generali"

msgid ""
"Write signal declarations, followed by properties, that is to say, member "
"variables, after the docstring."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enums should come after signals, as you can use them as export hints for "
"other properties."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, write constants, exported variables, public, private, and onready "
"variables, in that order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GDScript compiler evaluates onready variables right before the "
"``_ready`` callback. You can use that to cache node dependencies, that is to "
"say, to get child nodes in the scene that your class relies on. This is what "
"the example above shows."
msgstr ""

msgid "Member variables"
msgstr "Variabili membro"

msgid ""
"Don't declare member variables if they are only used locally in a method, as "
"it makes the code more difficult to follow. Instead, declare them as local "
"variables in the method's body."
msgstr ""

msgid "Local variables"
msgstr "Variabili locali"

msgid ""
"Declare local variables as close as possible to their first use. This makes "
"it easier to follow the code, without having to scroll too much to find "
"where the variable was declared."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Methods and static functions"
msgstr "Metodi e funzioni statiche"

msgid "After the class's properties come the methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Start with the ``_init()`` callback method, that the engine will call upon "
"creating the object in memory. Follow with the ``_ready()`` callback, that "
"Godot calls when it adds a node to the scene tree."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These functions should come first because they show how the object is "
"initialized."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Other built-in virtual callbacks, like ``_unhandled_input()`` and "
"``_physics_process``, should come next. These control the object's main loop "
"and interactions with the game engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The rest of the class's interface, public and private methods, come after "
"that, in that order."
msgstr ""

msgid "Static typing"
msgstr "Tipizzazione statica"

msgid ""
"Since Godot 3.1, GDScript supports :ref:`optional static "
"typing<doc_gdscript_static_typing>`."

#, fuzzy
msgid "Inferred types"
msgstr "Tipi dedotti"

msgid ""
"In most cases you can let the compiler infer the type, using ``:=``. Prefer "
"``:=`` when the type is written on the same line as the assignment, "
"otherwise prefer writing the type explicitly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Include the type hint when the type is ambiguous, and omit the type hint "
"when it's redundant."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In some cases, the type must be stated explicitly, otherwise the behavior "
"will not be as expected because the compiler will only be able to use the "
"function's return type. For example, ``get_node()`` cannot infer a type "
"unless the scene or file of the node is loaded in memory. In this case, you "
"should set the type explicitly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can use the ``as`` keyword to cast the return type, and "
"that type will be used to infer the type of the var."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"safe<doc_gdscript_static_typing_safe_lines>` than the first."
