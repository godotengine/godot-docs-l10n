"In Godot, class members can be exported. This means their value gets saved "
"along with the resource (such as the :ref:`scene <class_PackedScene>`) "
"they're attached to. They will also be available for editing in the property "
"editor. Exporting is done by using the ``export`` keyword::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An exported variable must be initialized to a constant expression or have an "
"export hint in the form of an argument to the ``export`` keyword (see the "
"*Examples* section below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of the fundamental benefits of exporting member variables is to have "
"them visible and editable in the editor. This way, artists and game "
"designers can modify values that later influence how the program runs. For "
"this, a special export syntax is provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exporting properties can also be done in other languages such as C#. The "
"syntax varies depending on the language."

msgid ""
"It must be noted that even if the script is not being run while in the "
"editor, the exported properties are still editable. This can be used in "
"conjunction with a :ref:`script in \"tool\" mode <doc_gdscript_tool_mode>`."

msgid "Exporting bit flags"
msgstr "Esportazione di bit flag"

msgid ""
"Integers used as bit flags can store multiple ``true``/``false`` (boolean) "
"values in one property. By using the export hint ``int, FLAGS, ...``, they "
"can be set from the editor::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You must provide a string description for each flag. In this example, "
"``Fire`` has value 1, ``Water`` has value 2, ``Earth`` has value 4 and "
"``Wind`` corresponds to value 8. Usually, constants should be defined "
"accordingly (e.g. ``const ELEMENT_WIND = 8`` and so on)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Export hints are also provided for the physics and render layers defined in "
"the project settings::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using bit flags requires some understanding of bitwise operations. If in "
"doubt, use boolean variables instead."

msgid "Exporting arrays"
msgstr "Esportazione di array"

msgid ""
"Exported arrays can have initializers, but they must be constant expressions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the exported array specifies a type which inherits from Resource, the "
"array values can be set in the inspector by dragging and dropping multiple "
"files from the FileSystem dock at once."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting exported variables from a tool script"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When changing an exported variable's value from a script in :ref:"
"`doc_gdscript_tool_mode`, the value in the inspector won't be updated "
"automatically. To update it, call :ref:`property_list_changed_notify() "
"<class_Object_method_property_list_changed_notify>` after setting the "
"exported variable's value."

msgid "Advanced exports"
msgstr "Esportazioni avanzate"

msgid ""
"Not every type of export can be provided on the level of the language itself "
"to avoid unnecessary design complexity. The following describes some more or "
"less common exporting features which can be implemented with a low-level API."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before reading further, you should get familiar with the way properties are "
"handled and how they can be customized with :ref:`_set() "
"<class_Object_method__get_property_list>`, :ref:`_get() "
"<class_Object_method__get_property_list>`, and :ref:`_get_property_list() "
"<class_Object_method__get_property_list>` methods as described in :ref:"
"`doc_accessing_data_or_logic_from_object`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For binding properties using the above methods in C++, see :ref:"
"`doc_binding_properties_using_set_get_property_list`."

"The script must operate in the ``tool`` mode so the above methods can work "
"from within the editor."

msgid "Properties"
msgstr "Proprietà"

msgid ""
"To understand how to better use the sections below, you should understand "
"how to make properties with advanced exports."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``_get_property_list()`` function gets called by the inspector. You can "
"override it for more advanced exports. You must return an ``Array`` with the "
"contents of the properties for the function to work."

msgid "Attaching variables to properties"
msgstr "Passare variabili a un'espressione"

msgid ""
"To attach variables to properties (allowing the value of the property to be "
"used in scripts), you need to create a variable with the exact same name as "
"the property or else you may need to override the :ref:`_set() "
"<class_Object_method__get_property_list>` and :ref:`_get() "
"<class_Object_method__get_property_list>` methods. Attaching a variable to "
"to a property also gives you the ability to give it a default state. ::"

msgid ""
"For better visual distinguishing of properties, a special script category "
"can be embedded into the inspector to act as a separator. ``Script "
"Variables`` is one example of a built-in category. ::"

msgid ""
"Every following property added after the category definition will be a part "
"of the category."

"``PROPERTY_USAGE_CATEGORY`` indicates that the property should be treated as "

"(which determined by ``hint_string``) will be shortened. For instance, "
"``rotate_speed`` is going to be shortened to ``speed`` in this case. "
