"In Godot, class members can be exported. This means their value gets saved "
"along with the resource (such as the :ref:`scene <class_PackedScene>`) "
"they're attached to. They will also be available for editing in the property "
"editor. Exporting is done by using the ``export`` keyword::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An exported variable must be initialized to a constant expression or have an "
"export hint in the form of an argument to the ``export`` keyword (see the "
"*Examples* section below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of the fundamental benefits of exporting member variables is to have "
"them visible and editable in the editor. This way, artists and game "
"designers can modify values that later influence how the program runs. For "
"this, a special export syntax is provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exporting properties can also be done in other languages such as C#. The "
"syntax varies depending on the language."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples"
msgstr "Esempi"

msgid ""
"It must be noted that even if the script is not being run while in the "
"editor, the exported properties are still editable. This can be used in "
"conjunction with a :ref:`script in \"tool\" mode <doc_gdscript_tool_mode>`."

msgid "Exporting bit flags"
msgstr "Esportazione di bit flag"

msgid ""
"Integers used as bit flags can store multiple ``true``/``false`` (boolean) "
"values in one property. By using the export hint ``int, FLAGS, ...``, they "
"can be set from the editor::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You must provide a string description for each flag. In this example, "
"``Fire`` has value 1, ``Water`` has value 2, ``Earth`` has value 4 and "
"``Wind`` corresponds to value 8. Usually, constants should be defined "
"accordingly (e.g. ``const ELEMENT_WIND = 8`` and so on)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Export hints are also provided for the physics and render layers defined in "
"the project settings::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using bit flags requires some understanding of bitwise operations. If in "
"doubt, use boolean variables instead."

"Exported arrays can have initializers, but they must be constant expressions."

"If the exported array specifies a type which inherits from Resource, the "
"array values can be set in the inspector by dragging and dropping multiple "
"files from the FileSystem dock at once."

msgid "Setting exported variables from a tool script"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When changing an exported variable's value from a script in :ref:"
"`doc_gdscript_tool_mode`, the value in the inspector won't be updated "
"automatically. To update it, call :ref:`property_list_changed_notify() "

"Not every type of export can be provided on the level of the language itself "
"to avoid unnecessary design complexity. The following describes some more or "
"less common exporting features which can be implemented with a low-level API."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before reading further, you should get familiar with the way properties are "
"handled and how they can be customized with :ref:`_set() "
"<class_Object_method__get_property_list>`, :ref:`_get() "
"<class_Object_method__get_property_list>`, and :ref:`_get_property_list() "

"To understand how to better use the sections below, you should understand "
"how to make properties with advanced exports."

msgid ""
"The ``_get_property_list()`` function gets called by the inspector. You can "

msgid "Attaching variables to properties"
msgstr "Passare variabili a un'espressione"

msgid ""
"To attach variables to properties (allowing the value of the property to be "
"used in scripts), you need to create a variable with the exact same name as "
"the property or else you may need to override the :ref:`_set() "
"<class_Object_method__get_property_list>` and :ref:`_get() "
"<class_Object_method__get_property_list>` methods. Attaching a variable to "
"to a property also gives you the ability to give it a default state. ::"

msgid "Adding default values for properties"
msgstr "Passare variabili a un'espressione"

msgid ""
"To define default values for advanced exports, you need to override the "
"``property_can_revert()`` and ``property_get_revert()`` methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``property_can_revert()`` method takes the name of a property and must "
"return ``true`` if the property can be reverted. This will enable the Revert "
"button next to the property in the inspector."
