msgid "An expression can be:"
msgstr "Un'espressione può essere:"

msgid "A mathematical expression such as ``(2 + 4) * 16/4.0``."

msgid "A built-in method call like ``deg2rad(90)``."

"A method call on an user-provided script like ``update_health()``, if "
"``base_instance`` is set to a value other than ``null`` when calling :ref:"
"`Expression.execute() <class_Expression_method_execute>`."

msgid ""
"The Expression class is independent from GDScript. It's available even if "
"you compile Godot with the GDScript module disabled."

"You can pass variables to an expression. These variables will then become "
"available in the expression's \"context\" and will be substituted when used "
"in the expression::"

msgid ""
"Both the variable names and variable values **must** be specified as an "

msgid "Setting a base instance for the expression"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, an expression has a base instance of ``null``. This means the "
"expression has no base instance associated to it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When calling :ref:`Expression.execute() <class_Expression_method_execute>`, "
"you can set the value of the ``base_instance`` parameter to a specific "
"object instance such as ``self``, another script instance or even a "
"singleton::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Associating a base instance allows doing the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Reference the instance's constants (``const``) in the expression."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reference the instance's member variables (``var``) in the expression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Call methods defined in the instance and use their return values in the "
"expression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting a base instance to a value other than ``null`` allows referencing "
"constants, member variables, and calling all methods defined in the script "
"attached to the instance. Allowing users to enter expressions may allow "
"cheating in your game, or may even introduce security vulnerabilities if you "
"allow arbitrary clients to run expressions on other players' devices."

"Most methods available in the :ref:`class_@GDScript` scope are available in "
"the Expression class, even if no base instance is bound to the expression. "
"The same parameters and return types are available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, unlike GDScript, parameters are **always required** even if they're "
"specified as being optional in the class reference. In contrast, this "
"restriction on arguments doesn't apply to user-made functions when you bind "
"a base instance to the expression."
