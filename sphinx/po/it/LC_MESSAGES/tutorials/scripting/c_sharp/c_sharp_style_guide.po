"This page contains a coding style guide, which is followed by developers of "
"and contributors to Godot itself. As such, it is mainly intended for those "
"who want to contribute to the project, but since the conventions and "
"guidelines mentioned in this article are those most widely adopted by the "
"users of the language, we encourage you to do the same, especially if you do "
"not have such a guide yet."

"For a general indentation rule, follow `the \"Allman Style\" <https://en."

msgid ""
"Use **PascalCase** for all namespaces, type names and member level "
"identifiers (i.e. methods, properties, constants, events), except for "
"private fields:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use **camelCase** for all other identifiers (i.e. local variables, method "
"arguments), and use an underscore (``_``) as a prefix for private fields "
"(but not for methods or properties, as explained above):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There's an exception with acronyms which consist of two letters, like "
"``UI``, which should be written in uppercase letters where PascalCase would "
"be expected, and in lowercase letters otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that ``id`` is **not** an acronym, so it should be treated as a normal "
"identifier:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is generally discouraged to use a type name as a prefix of an identifier, "
"like ``string strText`` or ``float fPower``, for example. An exception is "
"made, however, for interfaces, which **should**, in fact, have an uppercase "
"letter ``I`` prefixed to their names, like ``IInventoryHolder`` or "
"``IDamageable``."

"Lastly, consider choosing descriptive names and do not try to shorten them "
"too much if it affects readability."

msgid "Member variables"

msgid ""
"Don't declare member variables if they are only used locally in a method, as "

"variables in the method's body."
msgstr ""

msgid "Local variables"
msgstr "Variabili locali"

msgid ""
"Declare local variables as close as possible to their first use. This makes "
"it easier to follow the code, without having to scroll too much to find "
"where the variable was declared."

msgid "Implicitly typed local variables"

"the assignment:"
