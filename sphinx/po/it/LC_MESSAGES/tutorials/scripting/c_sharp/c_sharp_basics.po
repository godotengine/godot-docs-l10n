"C# support is a new feature available since Godot 3.0. As such, you may "
"still run into some issues, or find spots where the documentation could be "
"improved. Please report issues with C# in Godot on the `engine GitHub page "

"C# is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft. In Godot, it "
"is implemented with the Mono 6.x .NET framework, including full support for "
"C# 8.0. Mono is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework "
"based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common Language Runtime. A good "
"starting point for checking its capabilities is the `Compatibility <http://"
"www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/compatibility/>`_ page in the Mono "
"documentation."

"This is **not** a full-scale tutorial on the C# language as a whole. If you "

"Godot bundles the parts of Mono needed to run already compiled games, "

"required tools are included in the .NET Core SDK. MSBuild is also included "
"in the Mono SDK, but it can't build C# projects with the new ``csproj`` "

"cases. C++ is still a little faster; the specifics are going to vary "
