"Sometimes it can be useful to use the ``using static`` directive. This "

"Use the ``[Export]`` attribute instead of the GDScript ``export`` keyword. "

msgid "Signal keyword"

"Use the ``[Signal]`` attribute to declare a signal instead of the GDScript "

msgid "`onready` keyword"

"GDScript has the ability to defer the initialization of a member variable "

"`doc_gdscript_onready_keyword`). For example:"
msgstr ""

"However C# does not have this ability. To achieve the same effect you need "
"to do this."
msgstr ""

msgid "Singletons"
msgstr "Singletons"

msgid ""
"Singletons are available as static classes rather than using the singleton "
"pattern. This is to make code less verbose than it would be with an "
"``Instance`` property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, in some very rare cases this is not enough. For example, you may "
"want to access a member from the base class ``Godot.Object``, like "
"``Connect``. For such use cases we provide a static property named "
"``Singleton`` that returns the singleton instance. The type of this instance "
"is ``Godot.Object``."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "String"

msgid "There are a few differences, though:"
msgstr "Ci sono alcune differenze, per√≤:"

msgid ""
"``erase``: Strings are immutable in C#, so we cannot modify the string "
"passed to the extension method. For this reason, ``Erase`` was added as an "
"extension method of ``StringBuilder`` instead of string. Alternatively, you "
"can use ``string.Remove``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``IsSubsequenceOf``/``IsSubsequenceOfi``: An additional method is provided, "
"which is an overload of ``IsSubsequenceOf``, allowing you to explicitly "
"specify case sensitivity:"
