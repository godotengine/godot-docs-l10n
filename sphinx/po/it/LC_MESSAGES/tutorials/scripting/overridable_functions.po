msgid ""
"Godot's Node class provides virtual functions you can override to update "
"nodes every frame or on specific events, like when they enter the scene tree."
msgstr ""

msgid "This document presents the ones you'll use most often."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Under the hood, these functions rely on Godot's low-level notifications "
"system. To learn more about it, see :ref:`doc_godot_notifications`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two functions allow you to initialize and get nodes besides the class's "
"constructor: ``_enter_tree()`` and ``_ready()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the node enters the Scene Tree, it becomes active and the engine calls "
"its ``_enter_tree()`` method. That node's children may not be part of the "
"active scene yet. As you can remove and re-add nodes to the scene tree, this "
"function may be called multiple times throughout a node's lifetime."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most of the time, you'll use ``_ready()`` instead. This function is called "
"only once in a node's lifetime, after ``_enter_tree()``. ``_ready()`` "
"ensures that all children have entered the scene tree first, so you can "
"safely call ``get_node()`` on them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To learn more about getting node references, read :ref:"
"`doc_nodes_and_scene_instances`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another related callback is ``_exit_tree()``, which the engine calls every "
"time a node is about to exit the scene tree. This can be when you call :ref:"
"`Node.remove_child() <class_Node_method_remove_child>` or when you free a "
"node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The two virtual methods ``_process()`` and ``_physics_process()`` allow you "
"to update the node, every frame and every physics frame respectively. For "
"more information, read the dedicated documentation: :ref:"
"`doc_idle_and_physics_processing`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two more essential built-in node callback functions are :ref:`Node."
"_unhandled_input() <class_Node_private_method__unhandled_input>` and :ref:"
"`Node._input() <class_Node_private_method__input>`, which you use to both "
"receive and process individual input events. The ``_unhandled_input()`` "
"method receives every key press, mouse click, etc. that have not been "
"handled already in an ``_input()`` callback or in a user interface "
"component. You want to use it for gameplay input in general. The "
"``_input()`` callback allows you to intercept and process input events "
"before ``_unhandled_input()`` gets them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To learn more about inputs in Godot, see the :ref:`Input section <toc-learn-"
"features-inputs>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are some more overridable functions like :ref:`Node."
"_get_configuration_warnings() "
"<class_Node_private_method__get_configuration_warnings>`. Specialized node "
"types provide more callbacks like :ref:`CanvasItem._draw() "
"<class_CanvasItem_private_method__draw>` to draw programmatically or :ref:"
"`Control._gui_input() <class_Control_private_method__gui_input>` to handle "
"clicks and input on UI elements."
