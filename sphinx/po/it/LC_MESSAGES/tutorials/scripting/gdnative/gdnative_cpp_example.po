msgstr ""

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Introduzione"

msgid ""
"This tutorial builds on top of the information given in the :ref:`GDNative C "
"example <doc_gdnative_c_example>`, so we highly recommend you read that "
"first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The C++ bindings for GDNative are built on top of the NativeScript GDNative "
"API and provide a nicer way to \"extend\" nodes in Godot using C++. This is "
"equivalent to writing scripts in GDScript, but in C++ instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can download the full example we'll be creating in this tutorial `on "
"GitHub <https://github.com/BastiaanOlij/gdnative_cpp_example>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting up the project"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are a few prerequisites you'll need:"
msgstr ""

msgid "a Godot 3.x executable,"
msgstr ""

msgid "a C++ compiler,"
msgstr ""

msgid "SCons as a build tool,"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"a copy of the `godot-cpp repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-"
"cpp>`__."
msgstr ""
"una copia del `repository godot-cpp <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-"
"cpp>`__."

msgid ""
"See also :ref:`Compiling <toc-devel-compiling>` as the build tools are "
"identical to the ones you need to compile Godot from source."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can download these repositories from GitHub or let Git do the work for "
"you. Note that these repositories now have different branches for different "
"versions of Godot. GDNative modules written for an earlier version of Godot "
"will work in newer versions (with the exception of one breaking change in "
"ARVR interfaces between 3.0 and 3.1) but not vice versa so make sure you "
"download the correct branch. Also note that the version of Godot you use to "
"generate the ``api.json`` with becomes your minimum version."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`GDExtension <https://godotengine.org/article/introducing-gd-extensions>`__ "
"has been merged in the ``master`` branch of godot-cpp, but it is only "
"compatible with the upcoming Godot 4.0. Therefore, you need to use the ``3."
"x`` branch of godot-cpp to use GDNative and follow this example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial covers only GDNative in Godot 3.x, *not* GDExtension in Godot "
"4.0."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are versioning your project using Git, it is a good idea to add them "
"as Git submodules:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you decide to just download the repositories or clone them into your "
"project folder, make sure to keep the folder layout identical to the one "
"described here, as much of the code we'll be showcasing here assumes the "
"project follows this layout."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do make sure you clone recursive to pull in both repositories:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"``godot-cpp`` now includes ``godot-headers`` as a nested submodule, if "
"you've manually downloaded them please make sure to place ``godot-headers`` "
"inside of the ``godot-cpp`` folder."
msgstr ""
"``godot-cpp`` ora include ``godot-headers`` come sottomodulo annidato, se li "
"hai scaricati manualmente assicurati di mettere ``godot-headers`` dentro la "
"cartella ``godot-cpp``."

msgid ""
"You don't have to do it this way, but we've found it easiest to manage. If "
"you decide to download the repositories or clone them into your folder, make "
"sure to keep the folder layout the same as we've setup here. Much of the "
"code we'll be showcasing here assumes the project has this layout."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you cloned the example from the link specified in the introduction, the "
"submodules are not automatically initialized. You will need to execute the "
"following commands:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This will clone these two repositories into your project folder."
msgstr ""

msgid "Building the C++ bindings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now that we've downloaded our prerequisites, it is time to build the C++ "
"bindings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The repository contains a copy of the metadata for the current Godot "
"release, but if you need to build these bindings for a newer version of "
"Godot, simply call the Godot executable:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Place the resulting ``api.json`` file in the project folder and add "
"``use_custom_api_file=yes custom_api_file=../api.json`` to the scons command "
"below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To generate and compile the bindings, use this command (replacing "
"``<platform>`` with ``windows``, ``linux`` or ``osx`` depending on your OS):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To speed up compilation, add `-jN` at the end of the SCons command line "
"where `N` is the number of CPU threads you have on your system. The example "
"below uses 4 threads."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This step will take a while. When it is completed, you should have static "
"libraries that can be compiled into your project stored in ``godot-cpp/bin/"
"``."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may need to add ``bits=64`` to the command on Windows or Linux."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a simple plugin"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now it's time to build an actual plugin. We'll start by creating an empty "
"Godot project in which we'll place a few files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open Godot and create a new project. For this example, we will place it in a "
"folder called ``demo`` inside our GDNative module's folder structure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our demo project, we'll create a scene containing a Node called \"Main\" "
"and we'll save it as ``main.tscn``. We'll come back to that later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Back in the top-level GDNative module folder, we're also going to create a "
"subfolder called ``src`` in which we'll place our source files."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"You should now have ``demo``, ``godot-cpp``, ``godot-headers``, and ``src`` "
"directories in your GDNative module."
msgstr ""
"Ora dovresti avere le directory ``demo``, ``godot-cpp``, ``godot-headers`` e "
"``src`` nel tuo modulo GDNative."

msgid ""
"In the ``src`` folder, we'll start with creating our header file for the "
"GDNative node we'll be creating. We will name it ``gdexample.h``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are a few things of note to the above. We're including ``Godot.hpp`` "
"which contains all our basic definitions. After that, we include ``Sprite."
"hpp`` which contains bindings to the Sprite class. We'll be extending this "
"class in our module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We're using the namespace ``godot``, since everything in GDNative is defined "
"within this namespace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then we have our class definition, which inherits from our Sprite through a "
"container class. We'll see a few side effects of this later on. The "
"``GODOT_CLASS`` macro sets up a few internal things for us."
msgstr ""

msgid "After that, we declare a single member variable called ``time_passed``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the next block we're defining our methods, we obviously have our "
"constructor and destructor defined, but there are two other functions that "
"will likely look familiar to some, and one new method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first is ``_register_methods``, which is a static function that Godot "
"will call to find out which methods can be called on our NativeScript and "
"which properties it exposes. The second is our ``_process`` function, which "
"will work exactly the same as the ``_process`` function you're used to in "
"GDScript. The third is our ``_init`` function which is called after Godot "
"has properly set up our object. It has to exist even if you don't place any "
"code in it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's implement our functions by creating our ``gdexample.cpp`` file:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This one should be straightforward. We're implementing each method of our "
"class that we defined in our header file. Note that the ``register_method`` "
"call **must** expose the ``_process`` method, otherwise Godot will not be "
"able to use it. However, we do not have to tell Godot about our constructor, "
"destructor and ``_init`` functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The other method of note is our ``_process`` function, which simply keeps "
"track of how much time has passed and calculates a new position for our "
"sprite using a sine and cosine function. What stands out is calling ``owner-"
">set_position`` to call one of the built-in methods of our Sprite. This is "
"because our class is a container class; ``owner`` points to the actual "
"Sprite node our script relates to."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is one more C++ file we need; we'll name it ``gdlibrary.cpp``. Our "
"GDNative plugin can contain multiple NativeScripts, each with their own "
"header and source file like we've implemented ``GDExample`` up above. What "
"we need now is a small bit of code that tells Godot about all the "
"NativeScripts in our GDNative plugin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we are not using the ``godot`` namespace here, since the three "
"functions implemented here need to be defined without a namespace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``godot_gdnative_init`` and ``godot_gdnative_terminate`` functions get "
"called respectively when Godot loads our plugin and when it unloads it. All "
"we're doing here is parse through the functions in our bindings module to "
"initialize them, but you might have to set up more things depending on your "
"needs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The important function is the third function called "
"``godot_nativescript_init``. We first call a function in our bindings "
"library that does its usual stuff. After that, we call the function "
"``register_class`` for each of our classes in our library."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compiling the plugin"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We cannot easily write by hand a ``SConstruct`` file that SCons would use "
"for building. For the purpose of this example, just use :download:`this "
"hardcoded SConstruct file <files/cpp_example/SConstruct>` we've prepared. "
"We'll cover a more customizable, detailed example on how to use these build "
"files in a subsequent tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This ``SConstruct`` file was written to be used with the latest ``godot-"
"cpp`` master, you may need to make small changes using it with older "
"versions or refer to the ``SConstruct`` file in the Godot 3.0 documentation."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Once you've downloaded the ``SConstruct`` file, place it in your GDNative "
"module folder besides ``godot-cpp``, ``godot-headers`` and ``demo``, then "
"run:"
msgstr ""
"Una volta che hai scaricato il file ``SConstruct``, mettilo nella tua "
"cartella dei moduli GDNative oltre a ``godot-cpp``, ``godot-headers`` e "
"``demo``, poi eseguilo:"

msgid "You should now be able to find the module in ``demo/bin/<platform>``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here, we've compiled both godot-cpp and our gdexample library as debug "
"builds. For optimized builds, you should compile them using the "
"``target=release`` switch."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the GDNative module"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before we jump back into Godot, we need to create two more files in ``demo/"
"bin/``. Both can be created using the Godot editor, but it may be faster to "
"create them directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first one is a file that lets Godot know what dynamic libraries should "
"be loaded for each platform and is called ``gdexample.gdnlib``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This file contains a ``general`` section that controls how the module is "
"loaded. It also contains a prefix section which should be left on ``godot_`` "
"for now. If you change this, you'll need to rename various functions that "
"are used as entry points. This was added for the iPhone platform because it "
"doesn't allow dynamic libraries to be deployed, yet GDNative modules are "
"linked statically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``entry`` section is the important bit: it tells Godot the location of "
"the dynamic library in the project's filesystem for each supported platform. "
"It will also result in *just* that file being exported when you export the "
"project, which means the data pack won't contain libraries that are "
"incompatible with the target platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, the ``dependencies`` section allows you to name additional dynamic "
"libraries that should be included as well. This is important when your "
"GDNative plugin implements someone else's library and requires you to supply "
"a third-party dynamic library with your project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you double click on the ``gdexample.gdnlib`` file within Godot, you'll "
"see there are far more options to set:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second file we need to create is a file used by each NativeScript we've "
"added to our plugin. We'll name it ``gdexample.gdns`` for our gdexample "
"NativeScript."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a standard Godot resource; you could just create it directly in your "
"scene, but saving it to a file makes it much easier to reuse it in other "
"places. This resource points to our gdnlib file, so that Godot can know "
"which dynamic library contains our NativeScript. It also defines the "
"``class_name`` which identifies the NativeScript in our plugin we want to "
"use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Time to jump back into Godot. We load up the main scene we created way back "
"in the beginning and now add a Sprite to our scene:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We're going to assign the Godot logo to this sprite as our texture, disable "
"the ``centered`` property and drag our ``gdexample.gdns`` file onto the "
"``script`` property of the sprite:"
msgstr ""

msgid "We're finally ready to run the project:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding properties"
msgstr "Aggiungere proprietà"

msgid ""
"GDScript allows you to add properties to your script using the ``export`` "
"keyword. In GDNative you have to register the properties and there are two "
"ways of doing this. You can either bind directly to a member or use a setter "
"and getter function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a third option, just like in GDScript you can directly implement "
"the ``_get_property_list``, ``_get`` and ``_set`` methods of an object but "
"that goes far beyond the scope of this tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We'll examine both starting with the direct bind. Lets add a property that "
"allows us to control the amplitude of our wave."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our ``gdexample.h`` file we simply need to add a member variable like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our ``gdexample.cpp`` file we need to make a number of changes, we will "
"only show the methods we end up changing, don't remove the lines we're "
"omitting:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you compile the module with these changes in place, you will see that a "
"property has been added to our interface. You can now change this property "
"and when you run your project, you will see that our Godot icon travels "
"along a larger figure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``reloadable`` property in the ``gdexample.gdnlib`` file must be set to "
"``true`` for the Godot editor to automatically pick up the newly added "
"property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, this setting should be used with care, especially when tool classes "
"are used, as the editor might hold objects then that have script instances "
"attached to them that are managed by a GDNative library."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's do the same but for the speed of our animation and use a setter and "
"getter function. Our ``gdexample.h`` header file again only needs a few more "
"lines of code:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This requires a few more changes to our ``gdexample.cpp`` file, again we're "
"only showing the methods that have changed so don't remove anything we're "
"omitting:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now when the project is compiled, we'll see another property called speed. "
"Changing its value will make the animation go faster or slower."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For this example, there is no obvious advantage of using a setter and "
"getter. A good reason for a setter would be if you wanted to react on the "
"variable being changed. If you don't need to do something like that, binding "
"the variable is enough."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Getters and setters become far more useful in more complex scenarios where "
"you need to make additional choices based on the state of your object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For simplicity, we've left out the optional parameters in the "
"register_property<class, type> method call. These parameters are "
"``rpc_mode``, ``usage``, ``hint`` and ``hint_string``. These can be used to "
"further configure how properties are displayed and set on the Godot side."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Modern C++ compilers are able to infer the class and variable type and allow "
"you to omit the ``<GDExample, float>`` part of our ``register_property`` "
"method. We've had mixed experiences with this however."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signals"
msgstr "Segnali"

msgid ""
"Last but not least, signals fully work in GDNative as well. Having your "
"module react to a signal given out by another object requires you to call "
"``connect`` on that object. We can't think of a good example for our "
"wobbling Godot icon, we would need to showcase a far more complete example."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the required syntax:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that you can only call ``my_method`` if you've previously registered it "
"in your ``_register_methods`` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Having your object sending out signals is more common. For our wobbling "
"Godot icon, we'll do something silly just to show how it works. We're going "
"to emit a signal every time a second has passed and pass the new location "
"along."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our ``gdexample.h`` header file, we need to define a new member "
"``time_emit``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This time, the changes in ``gdexample.cpp`` are more elaborate. First, "
"you'll need to set ``time_emit = 0.0;`` in either our ``_init`` method or in "
"our constructor. We'll look at the other 2 needed changes one by one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our ``_register_methods`` method, we need to declare our signal. This is "
"done as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here, our ``register_signal`` method can be a single call first taking the "
"signals name, then having pairs of values specifying the parameter name and "
"type of each parameter we'll send along with this signal."
msgstr ""

msgid "Next, we'll need to change our ``_process`` method:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After a second has passed, we emit our signal and reset our counter. We can "
"add our parameter values directly to ``emit_signal``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the GDNative library is compiled, we can go into Godot and select our "
"sprite node. In the **Node** dock, we can find our new signal and link it up "
"by pressing the **Connect** button or double-clicking the signal. We've "
"added a script on our main node and implemented our signal like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Every second, we output our position to the console."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Next steps"
msgstr "I prossimi passi"

msgid ""
"The above is only a simple example, but we hope it shows you the basics. You "
"can build upon this example to create full-fledged scripts to control nodes "
"in Godot using C++."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To edit and recompile the plugin while the Godot editor remains open, re-run "
"the project after the library has finished building."
