msgid "TSCN file format"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The TSCN (text scene) file format represents a single scene tree inside "
"Godot. Unlike binary SCN files, TSCN files have the advantage of being "
"mostly human-readable and easy for version control systems to manage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ESCN (exported scene) file format is identical to the TSCN file format, "
"but is used to indicate to Godot that the file has been exported from "
"another program and should not be edited by the user from within Godot. "
"Unlike SCN and TSCN files, during import, ESCN files are compiled to binary "
"SCN files stored inside the ``.import/`` folder. This reduces the data size "
"and speeds up loading, as binary formats are faster to load compared to text-"
"based formats."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For those looking for a complete description, the parsing is handled in the "
"file `resource_format_text.cpp <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/"
"master/scene/resources/resource_format_text.cpp>`_ in the "
"``ResourceFormatLoaderText`` class."

msgid ""
"The file descriptor looks like ``[gd_scene load_steps=3 format=2]`` and "
"should be the first entry in the file. The ``load_steps`` parameter is equal "
"to the total amount of resources (internal and external) plus one (for the "
"file itself). If the file has no resources, ``load_steps`` is omitted. The "
"engine will still load the file correctly if ``load_steps`` is incorrect, "
"but this will affect loading bars and any other piece of code relying on "
"that value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These sections should appear in order, but it can be hard to distinguish "
"them. The only difference between them is the first element in the heading "
"for all of the items in the section. For example, the heading of all "
"external resources should start with ``[ext_resource .....]``."

msgid ""

"The first node in the file, which is also the scene root, must not have a "
"``parent=Path/To/Node`` entry in its heading. All scene files should have "
"exactly *one* scene root. If it doesn't, Godot will fail to import the file. "
"The parent path of other nodes should be absolute, but shouldn't contain the "
"scene root's name. If the node is a direct child of the scene root, the path "

msgid "NodePath"

msgid ""
"A tree structure is not enough to represent the whole scene. Godot uses a "
"``NodePath(Path/To/Node)`` structure to refer to another node or attribute "
"of the node anywhere in the scene tree. For instance, MeshInstance uses "
"``NodePath()`` to point to its skeleton. Likewise, Animation tracks use "

"References to the resources are handled by ``id`` numbers in the resource's "

"have different methods to refer to internal and external resources, you can "
"have the same ID for both an internal and external resource."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A TSCN file can contain meshes, materials and other data. These are "
"contained in the *internal resources* section of the file. The heading for "
"an internal resource looks similar to those of external resources, except "
"that it doesn't have a path. Internal resources also have ``key=value`` "
"pairs under each heading. For example, a capsule collision shape looks like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some internal resources contain links to other internal resources (such as a "
"mesh having a material). In this case, the referring resource must appear "
"*before* the reference to it. This means that order matters in the file's "
"internal resources section."
