"This page describes the rules to follow if you want to contribute to Godot "
"Engine by writing or reviewing documentation, or by translating existing "
"documentation. Also, have a look at README of the `godot-docs GitHub "
"repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs>`_ and the `docs front "
"page <https://docs.godotengine.org>`_ on what steps to follow and how to "
"contact the docs team."

msgid ""
"Creating or modifying documentation pages is mainly done via the `godot-docs "
"GitHub repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs>`_. The HTML "
"(or PDF and EPUB) documentation is generated from the .rst files "
"(reStructuredText markup language) in that repository. Modifying those pages "
"in a pull request and getting it merged will trigger a rebuild of the online "
"documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For details on Git usage and the pull request workflow, please refer to the :"
"ref:`doc_pr_workflow` page. Most of what it describes regarding the main "
"godotengine/godot repository is also valid for the docs repository."

"The class reference's source files are in the `Godot engine repository "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`_. We generate the :ref:`Godot API "
"<toc-class-ref>` section of this documentation from them. If you want to "
"update the description of a class, its methods, or properties, read :ref:"
"`doc_updating_the_class_reference`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to edit the **API reference**, please note that it should *not* "
"be done in the godot-docs repository. Instead, you should edit the ``doc/"
"classes/*`` XML files of Godot's main repository. These files are then later "
"used to generate the in-editor documentation as well as the API reference of "
"the online docs. Read more here: :ref:`doc_updating_the_class_reference`."
