"when handling issues and pull requests on Godot's `GitHub repository "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`__. It is bound to evolve together "
"with the bugsquad, so do not hesitate to propose modifications to the "

msgid "The following labels are currently defined in the Godot repository:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Categories:**"
msgstr "**Categorie:**"

msgid ""
"*Archived*: either a duplicate of another issue, or invalid. Such an issue "
"would also be closed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Breaks compat*: describes something that can only be fixed by breaking "
"compatibility with existing projects."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Bug*: describes something that is not working properly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Cherrypick*: describes something that can be backported to a stable branch "
"after being merged in the ``master`` branch."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Crash:* describes a bug that causes the engine to crash. This label is only "
"used for \"hard\" crashes, not freezes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Confirmed*: has been confirmed by at least one other contributor than the "
"bug reporter (typically for *Bug* reports). The purpose of this label is to "
"let developers know which issues are still reproducible when they want to "
"select what to work on. It is therefore a good practice to add in a comment "
"on what platform and what version or commit of Godot the issue could be "
"reproduced; if a developer looks at the issue one year later, the "
"*Confirmed* label may not be relevant anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Discussion*: the issue is not consensual and needs further discussion to "
"define what exactly should be done to address the topic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Documentation*: issue related to the documentation. Mainly to request "
"enhancements in the API documentation. Issues related to the ReadTheDocs "
"documentation should be filed on the `godot-docs <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot-docs>`_ repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Enhancement*: describes a proposed enhancement to an existing functionality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Feature proposal*: describes a wish for a new feature to be implemented. "
"Note that the main Godot repository no longer accepts feature requests. "
"Please use `godot-proposals <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-"
"proposals>`__ instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*For PR meeting*: the issue needs to be discussed in a pull request meeting. "
"These meetings are public and are held on the `Godot Contributors Chat "
"<https://chat.godotengine.org/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Good first issue*: the issue is *assumed* to be an easy one to fix, which "
"makes it a great fit for new contributors who need to become familiar with "
"the code base."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*High priority:* the issue is particularly important as it can prevent "
"people from releasing their projects or cause data loss."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Needs work*: the pull request needs additional work before it can be merged."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Needs testing*: the issue/pull request could not be completely tested and "
"thus need further testing. This can mean that it needs to be tested on "
"different hardware/software configurations or even that the steps to "
"reproduce are not certain."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"*Performance*: issues that directly impact engine or editor performance. Can "
"also be used for pull requests that improve performance or add low-end-"
"friendly options. Should not be coupled with *Usability*."
msgstr ""
"*Performance*: problemi che hanno un impatto diretto sulle prestazioni del "
"motore o dell'editor. Può anche essere usato per richieste di pull che "
"migliorano le prestazioni o aggiungono opzioni di fascia bassa. Non dovrebbe "
"essere accoppiato con *Usabilità*."

"*PR welcome / Hero wanted!*: Contributions for issues with these labels are "

"was released."

msgid ""
"*Salvageable*: the pull request can't be merged due to design issues or "
"merge conflicts and its author is not active anymore. However, it can still "
"be picked up by an external contributor to bring it to a mergeable state. To "
"do so, you need to open a new pull request based on the original pull "
"request."
msgstr ""
"*Salvageable*: la richiesta di pull non può essere unita a causa di problemi "
"di progettazione o conflitti di unione e il suo autore non è più attivo. "

"*Enhancement* and *Usability* at the same time if it's an issue to improve "
