"Godot Engine is a non-profit, community-driven free and open source project. "
"Almost all (but our lead dev Juan, more on that below) developers are "
"working *pro bono* on their free time, out of personal interest and for the "
"love of creating a libre engine of exceptional quality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means that to thrive, Godot needs as many users as possible to get "
"involved by contributing to the engine. There are many ways to contribute to "
"such a big project, making it possible for everybody to bring something "
"positive to the engine, regardless of their skill set:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Be part of the community.** The best way to contribute to Godot and help "
"it become ever better is simply to use the engine and promote it by word-of-"
"mouth, in the credits or splash screen of your games, blog posts, tutorials, "
"videos, demos, gamedev or free software events, support on the Q&A, forums, "
"Contributors Chat, Discord, etc. Participate! Being a user and advocate "
"helps spread the word about our great engine, which has no marketing budget "
"and can therefore only rely on its community to become more mainstream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Make games.** It's no secret that, to convince new users and especially "
"the industry at large that Godot is a relevant market player, we need great "
"games made with Godot. We know that the engine has a lot of potential, both "
"for 2D and 3D games, but given its young age we still lack big releases that "
"will draw attention to Godot. So keep working on your awesome projects, each "
"new game increases our credibility on the gamedev market!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Get involved in the engine's development.** This can be by contributing "
"code via pull requests, testing the development snapshots or directly the "
"git *master* branch, report bugs or suggest enhancements on the issue "
"tracker, improve the official documentation (both the class reference and "
"tutorials) and its translations. The following sections will cover each of "
"those \"direct\" ways of contributing to the engine."

"**Donate.** Godot is a non-profit project, but it can still benefit from "
"user donations for many things. Apart from usual expenses such as hosting "
"costs or promotional material on events, we also use donation money to "
"acquire hardware when necessary (e.g. we used donation money to buy a "
"MacBook Pro to implement Retina/HiDPI support and various other macOS-"
"related features). Most importantly, we also used donation money to hire "
"core developers so they can work full-time on the engine. Even with a low "
"monthly wage, we need a steady donation income to continue doing this, which "
"has been very beneficial to the project so far. So if you want to donate "
"some money to the project, check `our website <https://godotengine.org/"
"donate>`_ for details."
msgstr ""
"** Dona. ** Godot è un progetto senza scopo di lucro, ma può comunque "
"beneficiare delle donazioni degli utenti per molte cose. Oltre alle normali "
"spese, come per hosting o materiale promozionale per eventi, utilizziamo "
"anche il denaro delle donazioni per acquisire hardware quando necessario (ad "
"es. Abbiamo usato il denaro delle donazioni per acquistare un MacBook Pro "
"per implementare il supporto Retina / HiDPI e varie altre funzionalità "
"relative a macOS). Ancora più importante, abbiamo anche usato i soldi delle "
"donazioni per assumere sviluppatori core in modo che possano lavorare a "
"tempo pieno sul motore. Anche con un salario mensile basso, abbiamo bisogno "
"di un flusso di donazione costante per continuare a fare questo, che finora "
"è stato molto vantaggioso per il progetto. Quindi se vuoi donare un po 'di "
"soldi al progetto, controlla `il nostro sito web <https://godotengine.org/"
"donate>` _ per i dettagli."

"The possibility to study, use, modify and redistribute modifications of the "

"source_software>`_."

"As such, everyone is entitled to modify `Godot's source code <https://github."
"com/godotengine/godot>`_, and send those modifications back to the upstream "
"project in the form of a patch (a text file describing the changes in a "
"ready-to-apply manner) or - in the modern workflow that we use - via a so-"
"called \"pull request\" (PR), i.e. a proposal to directly merge one or more "
"Git commits (patches) into the main development branch."
msgstr ""

msgid "Contributing code changes upstream has two big advantages:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your own code will be reviewed and improved by other developers, and will be "
"further maintained directly in the upstream project, so you won't have to "
"reapply your own changes every time you move to a newer version. On the "
"other hand it comes with a responsibility, as your changes have to be "
"generic enough to be beneficial to all users, and not just your project; so "
"in some cases it might still be relevant to keep your changes only for your "
"own project, if they are too specific."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The whole community will benefit from your work, and other contributors will "
"behave the same way, contributing code that will be beneficial to you. At "
"the time of this writing, more than 1000 developers have contributed code "
"changes to the engine!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To ensure good collaboration and overall quality, the Godot developers "
"enforce some rules for code contributions, for example regarding the style "
"to use in the C++ code (indentation, brackets, etc.) or the Git and PR "
"workflow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A good place to start is by searching for issues tagged as `good first issue "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?"

"Details about the code style guidelines and the ``clang-format`` tool used "
"to enforce them are outlined in :ref:`doc_code_style_guidelines`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All pull requests must go through a review process before being accepted. "
"Depending on the scope of the changes, it may take some time for a "
"maintainer responsible for the modified part of the engine to provide their "
"review. We value all of our contributors and ask them to be patient in the "
"meantime, as it is expected that in an open source project like Godot, there "
"is going to be way more contributions than people validating them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make sure that your time and efforts aren't wasted, it is recommended to "
"vet the idea first before implementing it and putting it for a review as a "
"PR. To that end, Godot has a `proposal system <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot-proposals>`_. Its usage is encouraged to plan changes and "
"discuss them with the community. Implementation details can also be "
"discussed with other contributors on the `Godot Contributors Chat <https://"

msgid "Testing and reporting issues"
msgstr "Test e segnalazione di problemi"

msgid ""
"Another great way of contributing to the engine is to test development "

"issue** button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you report a bug, you should keep in mind that the process is similar "
"to an appointment with your doctor. You noticed *symptoms* that make you "
"think that something might be wrong (the engine crashes, some features don't "
"work as expected, etc.). It's the role of the bug triaging team and the "
"developers to then help make the diagnosis of the issue you met, so that the "
"actual cause of the bug can be identified and addressed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should therefore always ask yourself: what is relevant information to "
"give so that other Godot contributors can understand the bug, identify it "
"and hopefully fix it. Here are some of the most important infos that you "
"should always provide:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Operating system.** Sometimes bugs are system-specific, i.e. they happen "
"only on Windows, or only on Linux, etc. That's particularly relevant for all "
"bugs related to OS interfaces, such as file management, input, window "
"management, audio, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Hardware.** Sometimes bugs are hardware-specific, i.e. they happen only on "
"certain processors, graphic cards, etc. If you are able to, it can be "
"helpful to include information on your hardware."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Godot version.** This is a must-have. Some issues might be relevant in the "
"current stable release, but fixed in the development branch, or the other "
"way around. You might also be using an obsolete version of Godot and "
"experiencing a known issue fixed in a later version, so knowing this from "
"the start helps to speed up the diagnosis."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"**How to reproduce the bug.** In the majority of cases, bugs are "
"reproducible, i.e. it is possible to trigger them reliably by following some "
"steps. Please always describe those steps as clearly as possible, so that "
"everyone can try to reproduce the issue and confirm it. Ideally, make a demo "
"project that reproduces this issue out of the box, zip it and attach it to "
"the issue (you can do this by drag and drop). Even if you think that the "
"issue is trivial to reproduce, adding a minimal project that lets everyone "
"reproduce it is a big added value. You have to keep in mind that there are "
"thousands of issues in the tracker, and developers can only dedicate little "
"time to each issue."
msgstr ""
"** Come riprodurre il bug. ** Nella maggior parte dei casi, i bug sono "
"riproducibili, ovvero è possibile attivarli in modo affidabile seguendo "
"alcuni passaggi. Descrivi sempre questi passaggi nel modo più chiaro "
"possibile, in modo che tutti possano provare a riprodurre il problema e "
"confermarlo. Idealmente, crea un progetto dimostrativo che riproduca questo "
"problema immediatamente, comprimilo e allegalo alla issue (puoi farlo "
"trascinandolo). Anche se pensi che il problema sia banale da riprodurre, "
"l'aggiunta di un semplice progetto che consente di riprodurlo è un grande "
"valore aggiunto. Devi tenere presente che ci sono migliaia di issue nel "
"tracker e che gli sviluppatori possono dedicare poco tempo a ciascun issue."

"When you click the **New issue** button, you should be presented with a text "
