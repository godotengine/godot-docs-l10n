msgid "Code style guidelines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When contributing to Godot's source code, you will be expected to follow the "
"style guidelines outlined below. Some of them are checked via the Continuous "
"Integration process and reviewers will ask you to fix potential issues, so "
"best setup your system as outlined below to ensure all your commits follow "
"the guidelines."
msgstr ""

msgid "C++ and Objective-C"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are no written guidelines, but the code style agreed upon by the "
"developers is enforced via the `clang-format <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/"
"ClangFormat.html>`__ code beautifier, which takes care for you of all our "
"conventions. To name a few:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Indentation and alignment are both tab based (respectively one and two tabs)"
msgstr ""

msgid "One space around math and assignments operators as well as after commas"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pointer and reference operators are affixed to the variable identifier, not "
"to the type name"
msgstr ""

msgid "See further down regarding header includes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The rules used by clang-format are outlined in the `.clang-format <https://"
"github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/.clang-format>`__ file of the Godot "
"repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As long as you ensure that your style matches the surrounding code and that "
"you not introducing trailing whitespace or space-based indentation, you "
"should be fine. If you plan to contribute regularly, however, we strongly "
"advise that you set up clang-format locally to check and automatically fix "
"all your commits."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's code style should *not* be applied to third-party code, i.e. that is "
"included in Godot's source tree but was not written specifically for our "
"project. Such code usually comes from different upstream projects with their "
"own style guides (or lack thereof), and don't want to introduce differences "
"that would make syncing with upstream repositories harder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Third-party code is usually included in the ``thirdparty/`` folder and can "
"thus easily be excluded from formatting scripts. For the rare cases where a "
"third-party code snippet needs to be included directly within a Godot file, "
"you can use ``/* clang-format off */`` and ``/* clang-format on */`` to tell "
"clang-format to ignore a chunk of code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These guidelines only cover code formatting. See :ref:"
"`doc_cpp_usage_guidelines` for a list of language features that are "
"permitted in pull requests."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using clang-format locally"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First of all, you will need to install clang-format. As of now, you need to "
"use **clang-format 13** to be compatible with Godot's format. Later versions "
"might be suitable, but previous versions may not support all used options, "
"or format some things differently, leading to style issues in pull requests."

msgid "Here's how to install clang-format:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Linux: It will usually be available out-of-the-box with the clang toolchain "
"packaged by your distribution. If your distro version is not the required "
"one, you can download a pre-compiled version from the `LLVM website <https://"
"releases.llvm.org/download.html>`__, or if you are on a Debian derivative, "
"use the `upstream repos <https://apt.llvm.org/>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"macOS and Windows: You can download precompiled binaries from the `LLVM "
"website <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`__. You may need to add "
"the path to the binary's folder to your system's ``PATH`` environment "
"variable to be able to call ``clang-format`` out of the box."

msgid "Manual usage"
msgstr "Utilizzo manuale"

msgid ""
"You can apply clang-format manually for one or more files with the following "
"command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``-i`` means that the changes should be written directly to the file (by "
"default clang-format would only output the fixed version to the terminal)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The path can point to several files, either one after the other or using "
"wildcards like in a typical Unix shell. Be careful when globbing so that you "
"don't run clang-format on compiled objects (.o and .a files) that are in "
"Godot's tree. So better use ``core/*.{cpp,h}`` than ``core/*``."

msgstr "Gancio pre-commit"

msgid ""
"For ease of use, we provide a pre-commit hook for Git that will run clang-"

"its changes in the final commit."

"This \"hook\" is a script that can be found in ``misc/hooks``, refer to that "

"If your clang-format is not in the ``PATH``, you may have to edit the ``pre-"

"The first lines in the file should be Godot's copyright header and MIT "

"one where the class is declared (e.g. ``#include \"filename.h\"``), followed "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then come headers from Godot's own code base, included in alphabetical order "
"(enforced by ``clang-format``) with paths relative to the root folder. Those "
"includes should be done with quotes, e.g. ``#include \"core/object.h\"``. "
"The block of Godot header includes should then be followed by an empty line "
"for separation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, third-party headers (either from ``thirdparty`` or from the "
"system's include paths) come next and should be included with the < and > "
"symbols, e.g. ``#include <png.h>``. The block of third-party headers should "
"also be followed by an empty line for separation."
