"`Visual Studio Community <https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/>`_, "

"`MinGW-w64 <https://mingw-w64.org/>`_ with GCC can be used as an alternative "
"to Visual Studio. Be sure to install/configure it to use the ``posix`` "

"branch, you need GCC 9 or later."

"To install SCons, open the command prompt and run the following command::"

msgid ""
"If you are prompted with the message ``Defaulting to user installation "
"because normal site-packages is not writeable``, you may have to run that "
"command again using elevated permissions. Open a new command prompt as an "
"Administrator then run the command again to ensure that SCons is available "
"from the ``PATH``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check whether you have installed Python and SCons correctly, you can type "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the commands above don't work, make sure to add Python to your ``PATH`` "

"running the Python installer again and enabling the option to add Python to "
"the ``PATH``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If SCons cannot detect your Visual Studio installation, it might be that "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you've already made the mistake of installing Visual Studio without C++ "
"support, run the installer again; it should present you a **Modify** button. "
"Running the installer from *Add/Remove Programs* will only give you a "

"SCons will automatically find and use an existing Visual Studio "

"use MinGW, pass ``use_mingw=yes`` to the SCons command line. Note that MSVC "
"builds cannot be performed from the MSYS2 or MinGW shells. Use either ``cmd."
"exe`` or PowerShell instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During development, using the Visual Studio compiler is usually a better "
"idea, as it links the Godot binary much faster than MinGW. However, MinGW "

"If you are compiling Godot with MinGW, you can make the binary even smaller "
