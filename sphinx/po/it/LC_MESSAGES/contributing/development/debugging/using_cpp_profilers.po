"To optimize Godot's performance, you need to know what to optimize first. To "
"this end, profilers are useful tools."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a :ref:`built-in GDScript profiler <doc_the_profiler>` in the "
"editor, but using C++ profiler may be useful in cases where the GDScript "
"profiler is not accurate enough or is missing information due to bugs in the "
"profiler."

"These profilers may not be the most powerful or flexible options, but their "

msgid "Setting up Godot"
msgstr "Impostare"

msgid ""
"To get useful profiling information, it is **absolutely required** to use a "
"Godot build that includes debugging symbols. Official binaries do not "
"include debugging symbols, since these would make the download size "
"significantly larger."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get profiling data that best matches the production environment (but with "
"debugging symbols), you should compile binaries with the ``production=yes "
"debug_symbols=yes`` SCons options."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to run a profiler on less optimized builds (e.g. "
"``target=template_debug`` without LTO), but results will naturally be less "
"representative of real world conditions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do *not* strip debugging symbols on the binaries using the ``strip`` command "
"after compiling the binaries. Otherwise, you will no longer get useful "
"profiling information when running a profiler."
msgstr ""

msgid "Benchmarking startup/shutdown times"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're looking into optimizing Godot's startup/shutdown performance, you "
"can tell the profiler to use the ``--quit`` command line option on the Godot "
"binary. This will exit Godot just after it finished starting. The ``--quit`` "
"option works with ``--editor``, ``--project-manager`` or ``--path <path to "
"project directory>`` (which runs a project directly)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See :ref:`doc_command_line_tutorial` for more command line arguments "
"supported by Godot."

"Start the Godot editor or your project first. If you start the Project "
"Manager, make sure to edit or run a project first. Otherwise, the profiler "
"will not track the child process since the Project Manager will spawn a "
"child process for every project edited or run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open VerySleepy and select the Godot executable in the list of processes on "
"the left:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Click the **Profile All** button on the right to start profiling."

msgid ""
"Perform the actions you wish to profile in the editor or project. When "
"you're done, click **Stop** (*not* Abort)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait for the results window to appear."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the results window appears, filter the view to remove external modules "
"(such as the graphics driver). You can filter by module by finding a line "
"whose **Module** matches the Godot executable name, right-clicking that line "
"then choosing **Filter Module to <Godot executable name>** in the dropdown "

"The path to the working directory can be anything if an absolute path is "

"that the relative path to the project is valid."

msgid ""
"Make sure **Elevate Privileges** is checked if you have administrative "
"privileges. While not essential for profiling Godot, this will ensure all "
"events can be captured. Otherwise, some events may be missing in the "
"capture. Your settings should now look something like this:"

"Click **Start Recording** and perform the actions you wish to profile in the "

"Quit the editor/project normally or use the **Stop Profiling** button in "

"cleaner profiles if you're not interested in the engine's quit procedure."

"Use the tabs at the top to navigate between the different views. These views "
"show the same data, but in different ways. The **Flame Graph** tab is a good "
"way to see which functions take up the most time at a glance. These "
"functions are therefore the most important ones to optimize, since "
"optimizing them will improve performance the most."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the bottom of all tabs except **Summary**, you will also see a list of "
"CPU threads started by the engine among with the CPU utilization for each "
"thread. This lets you see threads that can be a bottleneck at a given point "
"in time."

msgid ""
"If you don't want the startup procedure to be included in the profile, you "
"can also attach HotSpot to a running process by clicking **Record Data** "
