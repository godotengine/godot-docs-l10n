msgid "The **design decisions** behind the Godot editor."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to work efficiently on the Godot editor's C++ code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This guide is aimed at current or future engine contributors. To create "
"editor plugins in GDScript, see :ref:`doc_making_plugins` instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are new to Godot, we recommended you to read :ref:"
"`doc_godot_design_philosophy` before continuing. Since the Godot editor is a "
"Godot project written in C++, much of the engine's philosophy applies to the "
"editor."
msgstr ""

msgid "Technical choices"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Godot editor is drawn using Godot's renderer and :ref:`UI system "
"<doc_user_interface>`. It does *not* rely on a toolkit such as GTK or Qt. "
"This is similar in spirit to software like Blender. While using toolkits "
"makes it easier to achieve a \"native\" appearance, they are also quite "
"heavy and their licensing is not compatible with Godot's."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The editor is fully written in C++. It can't contain any GDScript or C# code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Directory structure"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The editor's code is fully self-contained in the `editor/ <https://github."
"com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/editor>`__ folder of the Godot source "
"repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some editor functionality is also implemented via :ref:`modules "
"<doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>`. Some of these are only enabled in editor "
"builds to decrease the binary size of export templates. See the `modules/ "
"<https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/modules>`__ folder in the "
"Godot source repository."

"`editor/editor_node.cpp <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/"

msgid "Editor dependencies in ``scene/`` files"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When working on an editor feature, you may have to modify files in Godot's "
"GUI nodes, which you can find in the ``scene/`` folder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One rule to keep in mind is that you must **not** introduce new dependencies "
"to ``editor/`` includes in other folders such as ``scene/``. This applies "
"even if you use ``#ifdef TOOLS_ENABLED``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make the codebase easier to follow and more self-contained, the allowed "
"dependency order is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``editor/`` -> ``scene/`` -> ``servers/`` -> ``core/``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means that files in ``editor/`` can depend on includes from ``scene/``, "
"``servers/``, and ``core/``. But, for example, while ``scene/`` can depend "
"on includes from ``servers/`` and ``core/``, it cannot depend on includes "
"from ``editor/``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Currently, there are some dependencies to ``editor/`` includes in ``scene/`` "
"files, but `they are in the process of being removed <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot/issues/53295>`__."

"To iterate quickly on the editor, we recommend to set up a test project and :"
"ref:`open it from the command line <doc_command_line_tutorial>` after "
"compiling the editor. This way, you don't have to go through the Project "
"Manager every time you start Godot."
