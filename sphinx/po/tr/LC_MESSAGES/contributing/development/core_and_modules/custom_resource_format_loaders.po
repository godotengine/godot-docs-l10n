"ResourceFormatLoader is a factory interface for loading file assets. "
"Resources are primary containers. When load is called on the same file path "
"again, the previous loaded Resource will be referenced. Naturally, loaded "
"resources must be stateless."

msgid "Creating a ResourceFormatLoader"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each file format consist of a data container and a ``ResourceFormatLoader``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"ResourceFormatLoaders are classes which return all the necessary metadata "
"for supporting new extensions in Godot. The class must return the format "
"name and the extension string."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition, ResourceFormatLoaders must convert file paths into resources "
"with the ``load`` function. To load a resource, ``load`` must read and "
"handle data serialization."

"If you'd like to be able to edit and save a resource, you can implement a "
"``ResourceFormatSaver``:"

msgid "Creating custom data types"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot may not have a proper substitute within its :ref:`doc_core_types` or "
"managed resources. Godot needs a new registered data type to understand "
"additional binary formats such as machine learning models."

msgid ""
"Some libraries may not define certain common routines such as IO handling. "
"Therefore, Godot call translations are required."

msgid ""
"For example, here is the code for translating ``FileAccess`` calls into "
"``std::istream``."
