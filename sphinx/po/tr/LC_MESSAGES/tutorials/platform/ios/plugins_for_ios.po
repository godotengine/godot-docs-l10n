msgid ""
"Godot provides StoreKit, GameCenter, iCloud services and other plugins. They "
"are using same model of asynchronous calls explained below."
msgstr ""

msgid "ARKit and Camera access are also provided as plugins."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Latest updates, documentation and source code can be found at `Godot iOS "
"plugins repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-ios-plugins>`_"

"Son güncellemeler, belgeler, ve kynak kodu `Godot iOS eklenti deposu "

msgid "Accessing plugin singletons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To access plugin functionality, you first need to check that the plugin is "
"exported and available by calling the `Engine.has_singleton()` function, "
"which returns a registered singleton."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's an example of how to do this in GDScript:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Asynchronous methods"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When requesting an asynchronous operation, the method will look like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The parameter will usually be a Dictionary, with the information necessary "
"to make the request, and the call will have two phases. First, the method "
"will immediately return an Error value. If the Error is not 'OK', the call "
"operation is completed, with an error probably caused locally (no internet "
"connection, API incorrectly configured, etc). If the error value is 'OK', a "
"response event will be produced and added to the 'pending events' queue. "
"Example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remember that when a call returns OK, the API will *always* produce an event "
"through the pending_event interface, even if it's an error, or a network "
"timeout, etc. You should be able to, for example, safely block the interface "
"waiting for a reply from the server. If any of the APIs don't behave this "
"way it should be treated as a bug."
msgstr ""

msgid "The pending event interface consists of two methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``get_pending_event_count()`` Returns the number of pending events on the "
"queue."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Variant pop_pending_event()`` Pops the first event from the queue and "
"returns it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Store Kit"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Implemented in `Godot iOS InAppStore plugin <https://github.com/godotengine/"
"godot-ios-plugins/blob/master/plugins/inappstore/in_app_store.mm>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Store Kit API is accessible through the ``InAppStore`` singleton. It is "
"initialized automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following methods are available and documented below:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``purchase``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Purchases a product ID through the Store Kit API. You have to call "
"``finish_transaction(product_id)`` once you receive a successful response or "
"call ``set_auto_finish_transaction(true)`` prior to calling ``purchase()``. "
"These two methods ensure the transaction is completed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameters"
msgstr "Parametreler"

msgid ""
"Takes a dictionary as a parameter, with one field, ``product_id``, a string "
"with your product ID. Example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Response event"
msgstr ""

msgid "The response event will be a dictionary with the following fields:"
msgstr ""

msgid "On error:"
msgstr ""

msgid "On success:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``request_product_info``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Requests the product info on a list of product IDs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Takes a dictionary as a parameter, with a single ``product_ids`` key to "
"which a string array of product IDs is assigned. Example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``restore_purchases``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Restores previously made purchases on user's account. This will create "
"response events for each previously purchased product ID."
msgstr ""

msgid "The response events will be dictionaries with the following fields:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``set_auto_finish_transaction``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If set to ``true``, once a purchase is successful, your purchase will be "
"finalized automatically. Call this method prior to calling ``purchase()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Takes a boolean as a parameter which specifies if purchases should be "
"automatically finalized. Example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``finish_transaction``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't want transactions to be automatically finalized, call this "
"method after you receive a successful purchase response."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Takes a string ``product_id`` as an argument. ``product_id`` specifies what "
"product to finalize the purchase on. Example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Game Center"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Implemented in `Godot iOS GameCenter plugin <https://github.com/godotengine/"
"godot-ios-plugins/blob/master/plugins/gamecenter/game_center.mm>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
