msgid "Theme type variations"
msgstr "Tema tür değişimleri"

msgid ""
"When designing a user interface there may be times when a :ref:`Control "
"<class_Control>` node needs to have a different look than what is normally "
"defined by a :ref:`Theme <class_Theme>`. Every control node has theme "
"property overrides, which allow you to redefine the styling for each "
"individual UI element."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This approach quickly becomes hard to manage, if you need to share the same "
"custom look between several controls. Imagine that you use gray, blue, and "
"red variants of :ref:`Button <class_Button>` throughout your project. "
"Setting it up every time you add a new button element to your interface is a "
"tedious task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To help with the organization and to better utilize the :ref:`power of "
"themes <doc_gui_skinning>` you can use theme type variations. These work "
"like normal theme types, but instead of being self-sufficient and standalone "
"they extend another, base type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Following the previous example, your theme can have some styles, colors, and "
"fonts defined for the ``Button`` type, customizing the looks of every button "
"element in your UI. To then have a gray, red, or blue button you would "
"create a new type, e.g. ``GrayButton``, and mark it as a variation of the "
"base ``Button`` type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Type variations can replace some aspects of the base type, but keep others. "
"They can also define properties that the base style hasn't defined. For "
"example, your ``GrayButton`` can override the ``normal`` style from the base "
"``Button`` and add ``font_color`` that ``Button`` has never defined. The "
"control will use a combination of both types giving priority to the type "
"variation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The way controls resolve what theme items they use from each type and each "
"theme is better described in the :ref:`Customizing a project "
"<doc_gui_theme_in_project>` section of the \"Introduction to GUI skinning\" "
"article."

msgid "Creating a type variation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a type variation open the theme editor, then click the plus icon "
"next to the **Type** dropdown on the right side of the editor. Type in what "
"you want to name your theme type variation in the text box, then click **Add "
"Type**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Below the **Type** dropdown are the property tabs. Switch to the tab with a "
"wrench and screwdriver icon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click on the plus icon next to the **Base Type** field. You can select the "
"base type there, which would typically be the name of a control node class "
"(e.g., ``Button``, ``Label``, etc). Type variations can also chain and "
"extend other type variations. This works in the same way control nodes "
"inherit styling of their base class. For example, ``CheckButton`` inherits "
"styles from ``Button`` because corresponding node types extend each other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After you select the base type, you should now be able to see its properties "
"on the other tabs in the theme editor. You can edit them as usual."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using a type variation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now that a type variation has been created you can apply it to your nodes. "
"In the inspector dock, under the **Theme** property of a control node, you "
"can find the **Theme Type Variation** property. It is empty by default, "
"which means that only the base type has an effect on this node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can either select a type variation from a dropdown list, or input its "
"name manually. Variations appear on the list only if the type variation "
"belongs to the project-wide theme, which you can configure in the project "
"settings. For any other case you have to input the name of the variation "
"manually. Click on the pencil icon to the right. Then type in the name of "
"the type variation and click the check mark icon or press enter. If a type "
"variation with that name exists it will now be used by the node."
