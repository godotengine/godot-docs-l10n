msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The gaming community isn't monolingual or monocultural. It's made up of many "
"different languages and cultures - just like the Godot community! If you "
"want to allow players to experience your game in their language, one of "
"things you'll need to provide is text translations, which Godot supports via "
"internationalized text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In regular desktop or mobile applications, internationalized text is usually "
"located in resource files (or .po files for GNU stuff). Games, however, can "
"use several orders of magnitude more text than applications, so they must "
"support efficient methods for dealing with loads of multilingual text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two approaches to generate multilingual language games and "
"applications. Both are based on a key:value system. The first is to use one "
"of the languages as the key (usually English), the second is to use a "
"specific identifier. The first approach is probably easier for development "
"if a game is released first in English, later in other languages, but a "
"complete nightmare if working with many languages at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, games use the second approach and a unique ID is used for each "
"string. This allows you to revise the text while it is being translated to "
"other languages. The unique ID can be a number, a string, or a string with a "
"number (it's just a unique string anyway)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need a more powerful file format, Godot also supports loading "
"translations written in the gettext ``.po`` format. See :ref:"
"`doc_localization_using_gettext` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translation format"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To complete the picture and allow efficient support for translations, Godot "
"has a special importer that can read CSV files. Most spreadsheet editors can "
"export to this format, so the only requirement is that the files have a "
"special arrangement. The CSV files **must** be saved with UTF-8 encoding "
"without a `byte order mark <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Byte_order_mark>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid "CSV files must be formatted as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "keys"
msgstr ""

msgid "<lang1>"

msgid "KEY1"

"The \"lang\" tags must represent a language, which must be one of the :ref:"
"`valid locales <doc_locales>` supported by the engine. The \"KEY\" tags must "
"be unique and represent a string universally (they are usually in uppercase, "
"to differentiate from other strings). These keys will be replaced at runtime "
"by the matching translated string. Note that the case is important, \"KEY1\" "
"and \"Key1\" will be different keys. The top-left cell is ignored and can be "
"left empty or having any content. Here's an example:"

"The same example is shown below as a comma-separated plain text file, which "
"should be the result of editing the above in a spreadsheet. When editing the "
"plain text version, be sure to enclose with double quotes any message that "
"contains commas, line breaks or double quotes, so that commas are not parsed "
"as delimiters, line breaks don't create new entries and double quotes are "
"not parsed as enclosing characters. Be sure to escape any double quotes a "
"message may contain by preceding them with another double quote. "
"Alternatively, you can select another delimiter than comma in the import "
"options."

msgid "CSV importer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot will treat CSV files as translations by default. It will import them "
"and generate one or more compressed translation resource files next to it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Importing will also add the translation to the list of translations to load "
"when the game runs, specified in project.godot (or the project settings). "
"Godot allows loading and removing translations at runtime as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select the ``.csv`` file and access the **Import** dock to define import "
"options. You can toggle the compression of the imported translations, and "
"select the delimiter to use when parsing the CSV file."
