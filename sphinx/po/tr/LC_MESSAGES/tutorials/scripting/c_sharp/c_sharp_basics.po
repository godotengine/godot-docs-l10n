"This page provides a brief introduction to C#, both what it is and how to "
"use it in Godot. Afterwards, you may want to look at :ref:`how to use "
"specific features <doc_c_sharp_features>`, read about the :ref:`differences "
"between the C# and the GDScript API <doc_c_sharp_differences>`, and "
"(re)visit the :ref:`Scripting section <doc_scripting>` of the step-by-step "

"C# is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft. In Godot, it "

"Projects written in C# using Godot 4 currently cannot be exported to the web "

"This is **not** a full-scale tutorial on the C# language as a whole. If you "

"Godot bundles the parts of .NET needed to run already compiled games. "
"However, Godot does not bundle the tools required to build and compile "
"games, such as MSBuild and the C# compiler. These are included in the .NET "
"SDK, and need to be installed separately."

"When you create the first C# script, Godot initializes the C# project files "
"for your Godot project. This includes generating a C# solution (``.sln``) "
"and a project file (``.csproj``), as well as some utility files and folders "
"(``.godot/mono``). All of these but ``.godot/mono`` are important and should "
"be committed to your version control system. Everything under ``.godot`` can "
"be safely added to the ignore list of your VCS. When troubleshooting, it can "
"sometimes help to delete the ``.godot/mono`` folder and let it regenerate."

"Eğer C# kullanıyorsanız, yeni dışa aktarılan değişkenleri yada sinyalleri "
"görmek istediğinizde, projeyi (tekrar) derlemeniz gerekir. Bu derlemeyi elle "

"As C# support is quite new in Godot, there are some growing pains and things "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are some methods such as ``Get()``/``Set()``, ``Call()``/"
"``CallDeferred()`` and signal connection method ``Connect()`` that rely on "
"Godot's ``snake_case`` API naming conventions. So when using e.g. "
"``CallDeferred(\"AddChild\")``, ``AddChild`` will not work because the API "
"is expecting the original ``snake_case`` version ``add_child``. However, you "
"can use any custom properties or methods without this limitation. Prefer "
"using the exposed ``StringName`` in the ``PropertyName``, ``MethodName`` and "
"``SignalName`` to avoid extra ``StringName`` allocations and worrying about "
"snake_case naming."

"You might encounter the following error when trying to modify some values in "
"Godot objects, e.g. when trying to change the X coordinate of a ``Node2D``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is perfectly normal. Structs (in this example, a ``Vector2``) in C# are "
"copied on assignment, meaning that when you retrieve such an object from a "
"property or an indexer, you get a copy of it, not the object itself. "
"Modifying said copy without reassigning it afterwards won't achieve anything."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The workaround is simple: retrieve the entire struct, modify the value you "
"want to modify, and reassign the property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since C# 10, it is also possible to use `with expressions <https://learn."
"microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/with-"
"expression>`_ on structs, allowing you to do the same thing in a single line."

msgid "Performance of C# in Godot"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"According to some preliminary `benchmarks <https://github.com/cart/godot3-"
"bunnymark>`_, the performance of C# in Godot — while generally in the same "
"order of magnitude — is roughly **~4×** that of GDScript in some naive "
"cases. C++ is still a little faster; the specifics are going to vary "
"according to your use case. GDScript is likely fast enough for most general "
"scripting workloads."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most properties of Godot C# objects that are based on ``GodotObject`` (e.g. "
"any ``Node`` like ``Control`` or ``Node3D`` like ``Camera3D``) require "
"native (interop) calls as they talk to Godot's C++ core. Consider assigning "
"values of such properties into a local variable if you need to modify or "
"read them multiple times at a single code location:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Passing raw arrays (such as ``byte[]``) or ``string`` to Godot's C# API "
"requires marshalling which is comparatively pricey."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The implicit conversion from ``string`` to ``NodePath`` or ``StringName`` "
"incur both the native interop and marshalling costs as the ``string`` has to "
"be marshalled and passed to the respective native constructor."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using NuGet packages in Godot"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`NuGet <https://www.nuget.org/>`_ packages can be installed and used with "
"Godot, as with any C# project. Many IDEs are able to add packages directly. "
"They can also be added manually by adding the package reference in the ``."
"csproj`` file located in the project root:"
