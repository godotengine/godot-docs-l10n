msgid "File paths in Godot projects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This page explains how file paths work inside Godot projects. You will learn "
"how to access paths in your projects using the ``res://`` and ``user://`` "
"notations, and where Godot stores project and editor files on your and your "
"users' systems."
msgstr ""

msgid "Path separators"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make supporting multiple platforms easier, Godot uses **UNIX-style path "
"separators** (forward slash ``/``). These work on all platforms, **including "
"Windows**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of writing paths like ``C:\\Projects\\Game``, in Godot, you should "
"write ``C:/Projects/Game``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Windows-style path separators (backward slash ``\\``) are also supported in "
"some path-related methods, but they need to be doubled (``\\\\``), as ``\\`` "
"is normally used as an escape for characters with a special meaning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This makes it possible to work with paths returned by other Windows "
"applications. We still recommend using only forward slashes in your own code "
"to guarantee that everything will work as intended."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing files in the project folder (``res://``)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot considers that a project exists in any folder that contains a "
"``project.godot`` text file, even if the file is empty. The folder that "
"contains this file is your project's root folder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can access any file relative to it by writing paths starting with "
"``res://``, which stands for resources. For example, you can access an image "
"file ``character.png`` located in the project's root folder in code with the "
"following path: ``res://character.png``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing persistent user data (``user://``)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To store persistent data files, like the player's save or settings, you want "
"to use ``user://`` instead of ``res://`` as your path's prefix. This is "
"because when the game is running, the project's file system will likely be "
"read-only."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``user://`` prefix points to a different directory on the user's device. "
"Unlike ``res://``, the directory pointed at by ``user://`` is created "
"automatically and *guaranteed* to be writable to, even in an exported "
"project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The location of the ``user://`` folder depends on what is configured in the "
"Project Settings:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the ``user://`` folder is created within Godot's :ref:`editor "
"data path <doc_data_paths_editor_data_paths>` in the ``app_userdata/"
"[project_name]`` folder. This is the default so that prototypes and test "
"projects stay self-contained within Godot's data folder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If :ref:`application/config/use_custom_user_dir "
"<class_ProjectSettings_property_application/config/use_custom_user_dir>` is "
"enabled in the Project Settings, the ``user://`` folder is created **next "
"to** Godot's editor data path, i.e. in the standard location for "
"applications data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the folder name will be inferred from the project name, but it "
"can be further customized with :ref:`application/config/custom_user_dir_name "
"<class_ProjectSettings_property_application/config/custom_user_dir_name>`. "
"This path can contain path separators, so you can use it e.g. to group "
"projects of a given studio with a ``Studio Name/Game Name`` structure."
msgstr ""

msgid "On desktop platforms, the actual directory paths for ``user://`` are:"

"``[project_name]`` is based on the application name defined in the Project "
"Settings, but you can override it on a per-platform basis using :ref:"
"`feature tags <doc_feature_tags>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On mobile platforms, this path is unique to the project and is not "
"accessible by other applications for security reasons."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On HTML5 exports, ``user://`` will refer to a virtual filesystem stored on "
"the device via IndexedDB. (Interaction with the main filesystem can still be "
"performed through the :ref:`JavaScriptBridge <class_JavaScriptBridge>` "
"singleton.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Converting paths to absolute paths or \"local\" paths"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use :ref:`ProjectSettings.globalize_path() "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_globalize_path>` to convert a \"local\" path "
"like ``res://path/to/file.txt`` to an absolute OS path. For example, :ref:"
"`ProjectSettings.globalize_path() "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_globalize_path>` can be used to open \"local\" "
"paths in the OS file manager using :ref:`OS.shell_open() "
"<class_OS_method_shell_open>` since it only accepts native OS paths."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To convert an absolute OS path to a \"local\" path starting with ``res://`` "
"or ``user://``, use :ref:`ProjectSettings.localize_path() "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_localize_path>`. This only works for absolute "
"paths that point to files or folders in your project's root or ``user://`` "
"folders."

msgid ""
"If you create a file called ``._sc_`` or ``_sc_`` in the same directory as "
"the editor binary (or in `MacOS/Contents/` for a macOS editor .app bundle), "
"Godot will enable *self-contained mode*. This mode makes Godot write all "
"editor data, settings, and cache to a directory named ``editor_data/`` in "
"the same directory as the editor binary. You can use it to create a portable "
"installation of the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid ""
"Self-contained mode is not supported in exported projects yet. To read and "
"write files relative to the executable path, use :ref:`OS."
"get_executable_path() <class_OS_method_get_executable_path>`. Note that "
"writing files in the executable path only works if the executable is placed "
