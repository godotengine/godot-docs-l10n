"This tutorial is a short and practical introduction to linear algebra as it "
"applies to game development. Linear algebra is the study of vectors and "
"their uses. Vectors have many applications in both 2D and 3D development and "
"Godot uses them extensively. Developing a good understanding of vector math "
"is essential to becoming a strong game developer."
